1
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,293
This afternoon at 5:00.

2
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,424
Il Duce will speak to the nation!

3
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:46,425
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

4
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:52,469
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,861
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:59,776
Mussolini will speak to

7
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,559
all Italians!

8
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,343
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...

9
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,648
to interrupt your work.
This afternoon at 5:00...
Il Duce will speak to the nation.

10
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:17,041
<i>I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.</i>

11
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,607
<i>And my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.</i>

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,870
<i>That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...</i>

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,913
<i>and I got my first bicycle.</i>

14
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,480
The frame is British, the gears are German,

15
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:34,480
the pedals are French,

16
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:38,569
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

17
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,004
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

18
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,568
Are you sure it's safe?

19
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,352
I have new bikes too.

20
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:49,963
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

21
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,399
Fighting men,

22
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:58,486
on land, on sea and in the air,

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,575
Black shirts of the revolution,

24
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,967
men and women of Italy...

25
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:08,315
and the Kingdom of Albania, hearth is...

26
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,019
The hour...

27
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,368
of decisions from which

28
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,716
there is no return.

29
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:48,587
Pino, think this ant knows he's dead meat?

30
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:49,674
Who knows?

31
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,675
If he's like you, he doesn't know shit.

32
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:55,806
The declaration of war...

33
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,721
has already been delivered
to the ambassadors.

34
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,943
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

35
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,813
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

36
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:27,163
Hey, guys!

37
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,295
Lucky bastard.

38
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:37,426
- He got a new bicycle!
- Man, she's beautiful!

39
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,166
Custom-made, just like the racers.

40
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:45,123
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

41
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,341
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

42
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:50,169
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

43
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,430
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,606
- And you, "Don Sasa"?
- I don't want some kid poking into our business.

45
00:03:57,692 --> 00:04:00,606
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

46
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:07,608
She's coming!

47
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:13,523
What's going on?

48
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:18,611
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

49
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:13,016
- Who is she?
- The deaf guy's daughter, our new Latin teacher.

50
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:16,582
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!

51
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:21,730
What I wouldn't give for an hour with her!

52
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:25,818
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

53
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,514
What's her name?

54
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:31,646
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

55
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,517
The sun is bigger than the moon.

56
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,824
Or Sol maior est quam lunam.

57
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:51,043
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

58
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,782
Yes, but hurry.

59
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,740
I love honesty more than wealth.

60
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,621
- Seven thumbs long!
- Seven and a half thumbs!

61
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,839
- Mine's a bazooka!
- I got eight!

62
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,883
Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman.

63
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:52,536
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

64
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,102
Torpedo!

65
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:57,320
My submarine will rip Malena in half!

66
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,495
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

67
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,714
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

68
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:09,889
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

69
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,890
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

70
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:17,500
And there she was...
naked as the day she was born.

71
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,500
Holy shit! She did it
on purpose to excite me.

72
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:24,414
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

73
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:27,850
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

74
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:31,677
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

75
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,939
You little runt, you've been
here for two hours...

76
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,984
and you still haven't measured yourself.

77
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,288
Measure it!

78
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,203
One, two,

79
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,551
three, four, five...

80
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:48,029
Only six!

81
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,900
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

82
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,857
Short pants: Short dick!

83
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:56,814
Fuck off. My thumbs are
twice as big as yours!

84
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,032
Bullshit!

85
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,643
- Who's got the biggest dick now, runt?
- You do!

86
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,861
No, I am II Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

87
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,732
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

88
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,053
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

89
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,186
What cigarettes do you want?

90
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,274
Macedonia Extra.

91
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,889
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

92
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,977
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.

93
00:10:57,107 --> 00:11:01,021
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

94
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:05,588
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

95
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,022
My father's still young.

96
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,414
And you're too young
for long pants.

97
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,720
I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.

98
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:15,198
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

99
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,852
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

100
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:23,939
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?

101
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,419
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

102
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,420
- Leave him alone!
- I know what I'm doing.

103
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,552
And you let your friends beat you up.

104
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:40,162
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

105
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:44,772
But stealing trousers from your father...

106
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:49,165
and getting them altered for yourself
is just plain wrong.

107
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,643
But, Papa, you don't understand!

108
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,774
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

109
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:56,297
I'm ashamed to wear short pants!

110
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,515
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

111
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,428
Enough!
He's still a child!

112
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:05,256
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises!

113
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:13,040
Let's make a deal.

114
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:18,432
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader,"

115
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,477
then you'll get long pants.

116
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:23,869
Swear it.

117
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:04,259
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

118
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:08,391
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

119
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:11,478
She must have somebody
on the side... it's inevitable!

120
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,610
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

121
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,306
Right. Nino brings her from
her village with her ailing father.

122
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:21,437
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.

123
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:24,134
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

124
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,135
Not me!

125
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,396
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

126
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:35,528
You're too young to sit
in the adult chair.

127
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:55,059
But, son, if you don't know
the title, how can I help you?

128
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:57,364
It's that pretty, romantic one...

129
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:04,191
Ma L'Amore No.
Why didn't you say so?

130
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,410
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

131
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,932
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

132
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,107
- It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!

133
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,972
<i>Miss Malena, this heart of mine,
on fire, has written so many letters,</i>

134
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:45,408
<i>and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you,</i>

135
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:48,322
<i>it was only because
I didn't want to do you harm.</i>

136
00:21:49,018 --> 00:21:52,541
<i>So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.</i>

137
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,715
<i>I want you to know that
this town has many gossips...</i>

138
00:21:55,803 --> 00:22:00,498
<i>who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.</i>

139
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,978
<i>I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.</i>

140
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:08,023
<i>After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.</i>

141
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:47,946
I have to go.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

142
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:51,991
So long!

143
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:17,797
Don't get lost!

144
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:20,535
Mr. Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

145
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:22,014
Mind your own fucking business!

146
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:36,627
Good morning, Signora Malena.
Are you well? How is your father?

147
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:12,593
The show's over!
She's gone now!

148
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:09,608
I forgot the key.

149
00:26:25,874 --> 00:26:28,831
So it's true what people say!

150
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,092
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

151
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:32,483
You've poisoned me with your lies.

152
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:35,745
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

153
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:41,312
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

154
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,487
But I've never done anything wrong.

155
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:47,618
Liar! I've been following
you on my bicycle!

156
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:50,010
- I know where you went. I know everything!
- No!

157
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,358
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

158
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,011
Liar!

159
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,666
- Amoroso.
- Here!

160
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:02,796
- Cali.
- Here!

161
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:04,579
- Costanza.
- Here!

162
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,624
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

163
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:11,059
Can I put mine in her mouth?

164
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,190
Can I put mine
between her legs?

165
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,974
Okay, but one at a time!

166
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:52,592
Why didn't she marry
someone from her own village?

167
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,244
I'm sure no one wanted her.

168
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,159
They say she's a seamstress.

169
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,334
But she's so vulgar.

170
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:15,468
My son says she looks fake.

171
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:17,468
My husband says he wouldn't touch
her with a ten-foot pole.

172
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:22,209
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

173
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,686
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

174
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:28,471
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

175
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:32,428
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

176
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,472
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

177
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,791
The headquarters of
the armed forces communicates...

178
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:30,487
Our brave and invincible Fighting men
have delivered a powerful blow...

179
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,619
to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

180
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:38,968
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality...

181
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:44,187
of our forces at the front,

182
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:49,884
all payment of civic pensions...
will again be postponed...

183
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,886
- It's ready.
- Thank you.

184
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:25,561
Malena.

185
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,909
Right rank!
Eyes front!

186
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,171
Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

187
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:34,606
One, two! One, two!

188
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:39,348
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

189
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:41,435
Malena is available!

190
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:13,748
Comrades of Castelcuto,

191
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:16,399
we are gathered here today...

192
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,749
to share in the tragic
but honorable mourning...

193
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:23,272
which has struck our town.

194
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,837
To express our deepest condolences...

195
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:29,578
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...

196
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:34,579
heroically killed in action...
in Northern Africa...

197
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,928
and to his bride Maddalena,

198
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:42,493
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

199
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:47,148
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

200
00:32:47,452 --> 00:32:51,541
But she is with us in spirit,
because Sicilian women...

201
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:54,672
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

202
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,064
march shoulder to shoulder
with Fighting men!

203
00:33:02,674 --> 00:33:06,761
Of our fellow citizen in defense
of his country was not a useless

204
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,632
Lt. Cadei is so handsome.

205
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:14,111
A lucky girl will catch him!

206
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:17,634
That will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

207
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,898
For Victory!

208
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:29,941
Long live II Duce!

209
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,400
From now on I'll be at your side.

210
00:34:58,486 --> 00:35:01,183
Forever. I promise.

211
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,531
Just give me time to grow up.

212
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,372
Now she'll take a lover for sure.

213
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,503
Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!

214
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:06,504
She knows that. She's 27 years old.

215
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,636
She knows her way
around the block!

216
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,506
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

217
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:13,724
One day he was distracted
as he walked by...

218
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:17,855
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

219
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:22,074
Dentist or not, why haven't
we seen her lately?

220
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:25,336
Guess she's too busy!

221
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,423
They say she's fooling
around with a shopkeeper in Catania...

222
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:32,946
with subversive tendencies.

223
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:36,338
Some say Cusimano, the dentist.

224
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:40,862
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

225
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:45,820
I hear the priest has received
anonymous letters...

226
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:48,385
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

227
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,255
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

228
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,742
I can't talk to anyone about
my personal problems.

229
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:28,744
They're too intimate.

230
00:37:28,787 --> 00:37:31,962
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

231
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,919
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

232
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:45,574
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.

233
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:49,880
But you must protect
Malena Scordia from the town.

234
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,663
Yes, the widow... at least for
a few years. Then I'll take over.

235
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:50,026
I am always at your service.

236
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:52,244
- Renewed condolences, Malena.
- Condolences.

237
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,899
What a piece of ass!

238
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:06,900
Son of a bitch!

239
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:11,206
You little runt!
Come back here!

240
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,255
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

241
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:06,468
Renato, It's late.

242
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:08,818
Renato, get up.

243
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,646
Monster!

244
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,908
You're a fetishist,

245
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,343
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

246
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,301
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

247
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:32,389
Shame on you!

248
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,781
You shameless girl Can I keep them?

249
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:43,174
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

250
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,001
Come here, you little pig!

251
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:48,350
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?

252
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:54,873
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

253
00:42:55,352 --> 00:42:57,569
- Answer me!
- Okay!

254
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:04,702
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

255
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:08,398
Lock me up!
I'll show you!

256
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:12,529
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

257
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:17,357
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

258
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:20,532
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

259
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:24,446
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat.

260
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:26,664
Still... What is this shit?

261
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:30,926
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

262
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,883
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

263
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,883
Everything they give us is terrible!

264
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:39,059
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

265
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:41,624
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

266
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:43,669
The thread isn't the problem!

267
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:46,973
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

268
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:49,931
What does that mean?

269
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,628
Do you get it now?

270
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:55,759
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

271
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:58,845
But he'll have no pockets.

272
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:01,455
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

273
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,848
Lights out!

274
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:11,502
That the weary spirit may
never repose in more restful harbor...

275
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:14,763
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone blind.

276
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:23,287
While upon womens work
you sat intent,

277
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:26,679
content with the vague future
you held in mind...

278
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:29,115
was the scented May, and thus
you used to spend your days.

279
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:34,420
This child needs air.

280
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,638
- Air?
- Air.

281
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,169
Good morning, Professor.

282
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,347
This letter is for you.

283
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:25,869
It says "urgent."

284
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,221
You're dishonored.
Your daughter Malena is sleeping
with the whole town.

285
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:01,574
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

286
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:04,357
It says Malena is a whore
with everyone in town!

287
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,793
So there's hope for us too!

288
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:10,446
Take it back!

289
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:14,143
I'll bust your ass,
Mr. Short Pants!

290
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,589
Tonight was wonderful.

291
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:03,069
- For me too.
- I know it's been only ten months since.

292
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:07,026
- But maybe I can see you again.
- All right. You win.

293
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,462
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.

294
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:12,201
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

295
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:26,858
Take care of yourself.

296
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:37,642
So see you tomorrow?

297
00:47:37,643 --> 00:47:38,774
Yes.

298
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:42,514
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

299
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,907
What time?

300
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,777
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

301
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:56,169
How dare you pester my fiancee!

302
00:47:56,301 --> 00:47:59,432
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

303
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:01,606
You're a liar and a bastard!

304
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:05,128
Because I'm in uniform,
I can not retaliate, sir.

305
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:08,391
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime.

306
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:14,609
- Coward, scoundrel!
- Get up.

307
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,783
Come here!
I'll tear you apart, you coward!

308
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:20,045
I'll break you in two!

309
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,351
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

310
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,831
- Here's the adulterer!
- My wife!

311
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:34,180
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?

312
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:37,572
With a traitor!

313
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:40,225
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

314
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:41,355
It's the dentist.

315
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:47,052
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

316
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,444
And as for you,

317
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:53,010
go steal husbands from
your own village, you whore!

318
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,884
We knew she had one lover, but two?

319
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:10,059
But where does
the dentist fit in?

320
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:11,537
He fits in between her legs!

321
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:15,626
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

322
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:18,627
He never wants to see
his daughter Malena again.

323
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:21,975
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

324
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:27,627
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

325
00:49:27,628 --> 00:49:30,934
What's the dentist
got to do with it, poor guy?

326
00:49:31,064 --> 00:49:34,283
Malena's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

327
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:37,283
That Lt. Cadei seemed
like such a gentleman.

328
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,632
How could he get mixed up in this?

329
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:43,154
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

330
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:45,460
The lieutenant was asking for it!

331
00:49:45,546 --> 00:49:48,677
- She's not from here. She forgets where she is.
- Will they go to court?

332
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:54,765
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

333
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:59,333
The dentist needed
three stitches in his head.

334
00:49:59,506 --> 00:50:02,899
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

335
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:05,029
That's insulting an officer.

336
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,421
We'll all end up in court!

337
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:10,509
While we were
watching her caboose,

338
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,858
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

339
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:27,008
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

340
00:51:27,138 --> 00:51:30,009
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

341
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,966
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

342
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:36,923
Can I help you?

343
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,707
May I speak to Lawyer Centorbi?

344
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:41,621
Please have a seat.

345
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,970
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

346
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,014
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

347
00:52:02,191 --> 00:52:03,539
Have her come in.

348
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:05,627
- Go in.
- Thank you.

349
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:08,628
Please sit down.

350
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:10,584
Charmed.

351
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:19,846
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

352
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:23,153
the widow Scordia called Malena.

353
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,589
She could get two years in prison.

354
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,024
Everything will be fine, trust me.

355
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,288
Sit down.

356
00:52:47,638 --> 00:52:51,552
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...

357
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:55,466
in a secret and
amorous relationship...

358
00:52:55,553 --> 00:52:57,771
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

359
00:52:57,945 --> 00:53:00,815
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?

360
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,989
Yes.

361
00:53:03,164 --> 00:53:07,991
Are you or have you ever...
been his fiancee?

362
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:10,556
Absolutely not.

363
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:13,210
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

364
00:53:13,297 --> 00:53:17,037
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...

365
00:53:17,123 --> 00:53:19,168
on his way to your house?

366
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:20,385
I don't know.

367
00:53:20,603 --> 00:53:24,691
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

368
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,566
Yes, once.

369
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,219
- Where?
- At my house.

370
00:53:57,439 --> 00:54:00,091
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

371
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:05,745
- How long did he stay?
- Not long.

372
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:06,919
What did you do?

373
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,486
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

374
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:17,400
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

375
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:18,835
I don't know.

376
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:24,098
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

377
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,403
He said good-bye and left.

378
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:34,753
Then why has Cusimano,
are put able professional,

379
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:36,752
who, five years ago...

380
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:40,798
had the honor of extracting
one of II Duce's teeth...

381
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:43,103
publicly declare
that he is your fiance?

382
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:47,669
He made that up.
I had nothing to do with it.

383
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,583
Your husband's crazy.

384
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,627
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt. Cadei?

385
00:54:57,455 --> 00:55:02,717
I'm a widow. My business
and that of Lt. Cadei...

386
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:05,022
are no concern of the law.

387
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:10,719
All right.
Did you know that,

388
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:14,763
as a result of these affairs,
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?

389
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:15,502
One down.

390
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,417
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

391
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:20,678
Clerk.

392
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:23,287
He declared to have encountered

393
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:27,810
the widow Scordia only twice...
in her home,

394
00:55:27,897 --> 00:55:32,290
and to have had
no amorous relationship...

395
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:36,813
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship."

396
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:41,814
Son of a bitch.

397
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:45,989
Lt. Cadei was received by my client...

398
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:50,686
and she makes no secret
about having had for him...

399
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:53,382
certain feelings.

400
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:56,992
But unlike the married Cusimano,

401
00:55:57,384 --> 00:56:02,124
who was, let's face it, guilty...

402
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:04,994
of a pre-senile dimming of the senses...

403
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:08,038
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

404
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:13,649
Unlike the family man Cusimano,
But...

405
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:15,867
Cadei is...

406
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:20,085
and was...

407
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:21,564
a bachelor... a bachelor!

408
00:56:21,737 --> 00:56:23,738
Clever, that lawyer.

409
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,782
He's a bachelor himself.

410
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:31,131
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore...

411
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:34,567
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime...

412
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:37,307
than that of being ill-fated,

413
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:41,221
alone and beautiful.

414
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:43,395
Here is her crime: Her beauty!

415
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:45,134
And from here, the envy,

416
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,701
the lies, the disgrace,

417
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:51,223
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

418
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:55,877
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony...

419
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,747
mourning over
that unmarked war grave...

420
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:06,097
in faraway East Africa.

421
00:57:07,141 --> 00:57:10,489
In the beating heart of our argument...

422
00:57:10,663 --> 00:57:15,273
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis...

423
00:57:15,577 --> 00:57:17,490
which asks just one question:

424
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:19,666
Can a young woman...

425
00:57:19,753 --> 00:57:24,623
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country...

426
00:57:24,624 --> 00:57:29,886
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

427
00:57:30,016 --> 00:57:33,365
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write...

428
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:36,627
a new ending to her own love story?

429
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,411
Your Honor,

430
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:41,802
the citizens
of Castelcuto reply: "Yes!"

431
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,502
Will Cusimano
leave me alone now?

432
00:57:55,675 --> 00:58:00,416
Of course. He's been put
into a psychiatric clinic.

433
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,634
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

434
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:08,592
He doesn't realize
we lost Africa ages ago!

435
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:12,637
But let's forget Cusimano
and the fickle Lt. Cadei.

436
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,029
Let's get to us!

437
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,117
I know it's not much.

438
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:24,857
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

439
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:27,292
Don't you understand?

440
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:30,076
That's peanuts!

441
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:32,947
My fee is much more than that.

442
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,904
You'll never have enough money!

443
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,035
But how will I ever repay you?

444
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:43,036
It's very easy, my sweet.

445
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:47,471
- What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

446
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,385
I'm in love with you!

447
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:56,735
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

448
00:58:57,518 --> 00:59:00,127
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

449
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:05,085
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

450
00:59:29,352 --> 00:59:33,831
I forgive her. She did it
to pay her lawyer's fees

451
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:35,528
only once and never again.

452
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,832
But you didn't keep our agreement.

453
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:41,530
Now we're even.

454
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:55,434
<i>Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me...</i>

455
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:59,392
<i>wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love.</i>

456
01:01:59,479 --> 01:02:01,262
<i>Now I understand why.</i>

457
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,480
<i>It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.</i>

458
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,176
<i>But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.</i>

459
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:12,874
<i>They say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.</i>

460
01:02:13,004 --> 01:02:15,048
<i>I know how badly
they treat you here,</i>

461
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:18,614
<i>how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food...</i>

462
01:02:18,788 --> 01:02:21,136
<i>and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.</i>

463
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:25,529
<i>But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man...</i>

464
01:02:25,746 --> 01:02:28,835
<i>so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?</i>

465
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:33,879
<i>They say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.</i>

466
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,097
<i>How will your smooth, white skin...
bear rubbing against</i>

467
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:39,272
<i>the sweat of an old man...</i>

468
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:43,273
<i>who never does anything
without his mother's consent?</i>

469
01:03:09,236 --> 01:03:11,410
Is it true you're getting married?

470
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:14,760
What are you writing?

471
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:17,891
Give me that!
Let me see!

472
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:20,021
Get out!

473
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,941
Stand up straight.

474
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,116
A little longer, Don Placido.

475
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:51,203
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

476
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:52,465
Will they be ready tomorrow?

477
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:56,336
The war has ruined
my business, but it still takes time.

478
01:03:56,553 --> 01:03:58,728
As Allied bombings continue.

479
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:06,729
Wait for me.

480
01:04:10,035 --> 01:04:12,992
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

481
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:21,386
Moron! Idiot!

482
01:04:21,604 --> 01:04:22,734
Idiot!

483
01:04:22,908 --> 01:04:24,908
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

484
01:04:25,256 --> 01:04:26,822
Get this straight.
Your father's good name...

485
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:31,214
will never belong
to that disgusting whore!

486
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:33,606
Never! Never!

487
01:04:33,693 --> 01:04:37,911
Never!

488
01:05:02,222 --> 01:05:04,136
The lawyer was left
high and dry!

489
01:05:04,223 --> 01:05:07,702
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

490
01:05:08,224 --> 01:05:11,137
Malena always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

491
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:14,921
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

492
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:20,663
- Come on, sit down.
- The next in line already has a plan.

493
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:23,185
Yeah, his plan is in his pants.

494
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:26,272
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

495
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:52,730
Good morning, Antonio.

496
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,687
I brought some sugar and flour.

497
01:06:55,861 --> 01:06:58,036
- What about the bread?
- The best.

498
01:07:02,863 --> 01:07:06,082
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

499
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:09,256
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

500
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:18,622
Hurry, there's someone else over here!

501
01:08:40,236 --> 01:08:42,324
It's Professor Bonsignore.

502
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,629
Malena's father.

503
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:53,126
I'm here for you.

504
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:57,822
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

505
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,084
Condolences.

506
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,737
Step aside, kid.

507
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:11,434
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

508
01:10:11,435 --> 01:10:12,478
Don't forget my offer.

509
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,522
- Who is it?
- It's me.

510
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,219
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

511
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:06,046
I brought you some more food.

512
01:13:07,306 --> 01:13:08,524
Come in.

513
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:25,486
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

514
01:13:25,616 --> 01:13:29,487
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

515
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,057
I can come every Thursday!

516
01:13:46,273 --> 01:13:47,882
As long as you bring the food.

517
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:25,545
Never before in our history have
we been called upon to band together.

518
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:28,546
Just a few years ago,
II Duce promised

519
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:32,285
that the Nazis would
never occupy Sicily.

520
01:14:32,286 --> 01:14:34,156
Look! The Germans are everywhere!

521
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,331
Look who's here.

522
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,511
She's a redhead now.

523
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:04,381
Look how she's put together.

524
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:06,816
I'd like to cut off that hair.

525
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:20,167
How disgusting!

526
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,677
Now she's even screwing the Germans.

527
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:18,763
- Who's that?
- Malena Scordia, the slut.

528
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:21,983
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

529
01:17:22,156 --> 01:17:24,896
But with the Germans?

530
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:28,506
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

531
01:17:29,071 --> 01:17:31,811
The two whores run
from room to room...

532
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:35,682
servicing a dozen officers at a time.

533
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,639
Holy shit!

534
01:18:09,082 --> 01:18:12,300
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

535
01:18:13,518 --> 01:18:14,648
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

536
01:18:23,911 --> 01:18:24,651
Rosa!

537
01:18:28,086 --> 01:18:29,565
Come here!

538
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:32,784
That's enough!

539
01:18:33,132 --> 01:18:36,089
It looks like you're posing
for Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

540
01:18:36,698 --> 01:18:37,437
No.

541
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:41,308
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

542
01:18:41,482 --> 01:18:44,744
Exorcise the devil
from this child.

543
01:18:44,918 --> 01:18:46,657
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

544
01:18:46,787 --> 01:18:49,354
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

545
01:18:49,745 --> 01:18:51,876
Cast the devil into the wild.

546
01:18:53,137 --> 01:18:54,572
Shameful!

547
01:18:54,703 --> 01:18:58,269
Disgraceful!

548
01:18:58,355 --> 01:19:03,357
They cured my uncle this way...
and he had cholera!

549
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:06,228
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

550
01:19:06,314 --> 01:19:09,532
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

551
01:19:18,839 --> 01:19:19,970
Renato!

552
01:19:26,494 --> 01:19:28,407
Renato, wait here for me.

553
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:38,714
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

554
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:41,280
- My father?
- He's coming.

555
01:19:41,888 --> 01:19:44,106
Ladies!

556
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:45,977
Choose the one you like.

557
01:19:46,107 --> 01:19:49,152
Ladies!

558
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:51,109
What do we have here?

559
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:53,197
Fresh young meat.

560
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,866
Lupetta, up to the room.

561
01:21:05,258 --> 01:21:06,650
Treat him right.

562
01:21:14,914 --> 01:21:17,218
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

563
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,263
Amoroso. What a romantic name!

564
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,959
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

565
01:21:28,657 --> 01:21:29,831
Go ahead.

566
01:23:14,553 --> 01:23:17,163
- Is it your first time?
- No.

567
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:20,903
I've imagined it many times.

568
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:46,056
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

569
01:24:51,275 --> 01:24:54,058
Stay back.
This is between the women.

570
01:26:22,995 --> 01:26:26,126
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men...

571
01:26:36,563 --> 01:26:38,738
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

572
01:26:41,478 --> 01:26:43,391
It's the end of spreading
your legs, whore!

573
01:27:00,744 --> 01:27:02,439
Now let's see
what men make of you!

574
01:27:08,746 --> 01:27:11,138
The madame is served.

575
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:21,765
Get lost!

576
01:28:22,678 --> 01:28:24,765
Disappear!

577
01:32:19,045 --> 01:32:21,871
- I know that face.
- Who is it?

578
01:32:24,698 --> 01:32:27,047
Nino Scordia, Malena's husband.

579
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:30,439
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

580
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:40,616
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

581
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:48,748
Isn't that Malena's husband?

582
01:33:15,842 --> 01:33:19,147
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

583
01:33:28,498 --> 01:33:30,107
Do you know Malena Scordia?

584
01:33:30,933 --> 01:33:32,064
Who's she?

585
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:34,672
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

586
01:33:34,673 --> 01:33:36,587
We don't know anything.

587
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:39,413
When we came,
no one was living here.

588
01:33:39,545 --> 01:33:41,066
No one?

589
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:59,202
Poor guy. No one
will tell him the truth.

590
01:33:59,288 --> 01:34:03,203
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

591
01:34:03,289 --> 01:34:06,986
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

592
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,553
I lost an arm.
I wasn't dead!

593
01:34:10,683 --> 01:34:15,075
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria. Tell him.

594
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:17,728
Sir, he lost his arm...

595
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,164
Hey, kid, what are
you doing here? Go away.

596
01:34:20,772 --> 01:34:22,034
Me "boy-bar." Coffee.

597
01:34:22,207 --> 01:34:26,077
I have to get the coffee cups.
Understand?

598
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,253
Okay, alright.

599
01:34:28,297 --> 01:34:31,297
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

600
01:34:31,471 --> 01:34:33,602
Now no one will talk to me.

601
01:34:33,689 --> 01:34:35,168
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

602
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:38,256
No one in town knows
where she is.

603
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:42,256
His wife was the woman

604
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,997
we saw beaten up
on the day we arrived here.

605
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:47,954
Everybody says she's
a prostitute in a whorehouse.

606
01:34:48,171 --> 01:34:50,346
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

607
01:35:13,351 --> 01:35:18,223
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

608
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,180
- You mistake me for someone else.
- Could I have a light?

609
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:26,573
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

610
01:35:27,268 --> 01:35:28,530
You can help me. Do you know
what happened to my wife?

611
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:31,008
Didn't she join the Communist Party?

612
01:35:32,617 --> 01:35:36,749
She was photographed
with her arms around the Commie leader.

613
01:35:39,445 --> 01:35:42,011
You're a family of heroes!

614
01:35:44,056 --> 01:35:45,708
You're right.

615
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:50,318
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

616
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:54,798
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

617
01:35:54,971 --> 01:35:58,537
You may find your wife there!

618
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,033
Wait a minute. Come back!

619
01:37:09,209 --> 01:37:10,861
<i>Dear Signor Scordia,</i>

620
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:14,862
<i>forgive me if I don't have
the courage to speak man to man.</i>

621
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:20,211
<i>These last months have
taught me much about courage,
even if I have found little myself.</i>

622
01:37:20,559 --> 01:37:23,343
<i>I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.</i>

623
01:37:23,517 --> 01:37:27,778
<i>Around here, they only say
bad things about her.</i>

624
01:37:27,996 --> 01:37:31,997
<i>But believe me, your wife
Malena was faithful to you.</i>

625
01:37:32,127 --> 01:37:35,911
<i>You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.</i>

626
01:37:36,302 --> 01:37:38,910
<i>It is true,
a lot of things happened,</i>

627
01:37:38,911 --> 01:37:42,304
<i>but back then,
you had been dead along time.</i>

628
01:37:42,609 --> 01:37:47,349
<i>The last time I saw her, she was
on a train for Messina.</i>

629
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:51,828
<i>I should sign "a friend,"
like all anonymous letters,</i>

630
01:37:52,002 --> 01:37:53,872
<i>but my name is Renato.</i>

631
01:38:33,318 --> 01:38:36,057
Good morning, Judge.

632
01:38:38,058 --> 01:38:39,536
All is well, thank God.

633
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,103
Eat up, my sweet pea.

634
01:38:56,585 --> 01:38:58,585
- Sons of bitches!
- Look who's here!

635
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:01,499
Giorgio, look who's here!

636
01:40:03,255 --> 01:40:06,038
Why are you all
looking at that woman?

637
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:07,646
It's nothing.

638
01:40:35,828 --> 01:40:38,655
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

639
01:40:38,742 --> 01:40:40,786
Quiet. She's here!

640
01:40:42,221 --> 01:40:45,309
It took a lot of courage to come back.

641
01:40:46,179 --> 01:40:47,788
Look who's here.

642
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:51,963
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

643
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:54,964
- What have they got to look at?
- They should leave her in peace.

644
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:00,443
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

645
01:41:00,573 --> 01:41:02,226
She's put on weight, too.

646
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,662
But she's still beautiful.

647
01:41:07,054 --> 01:41:09,184
Good morning, Mrs. Scordia.

648
01:41:25,275 --> 01:41:26,537
Good morning.

649
01:41:28,755 --> 01:41:31,886
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

650
01:41:31,973 --> 01:41:34,365
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

651
01:41:37,453 --> 01:41:39,453
Nice things here!

652
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:43,193
- Like it, Signora Malena?
- Yes.

653
01:41:43,323 --> 01:41:45,759
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

654
01:41:45,847 --> 01:41:47,890
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

655
01:41:48,456 --> 01:41:52,240
Give me your bag.
We'll discuss it later.

656
01:41:52,370 --> 01:41:55,197
- Thank you.
- Good day.

657
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,778
It's okay. I'll get it.

658
01:43:01,474 --> 01:43:02,866
Thank you.

659
01:43:05,998 --> 01:43:07,172
Thank you for your help.

660
01:43:13,522 --> 01:43:15,566
Good luck, Signora Malena.

661
01:43:45,704 --> 01:43:49,270
<i>I pedaled as fast as I could</i>

662
01:43:49,444 --> 01:43:51,488
<i>as if I were escaping...</i>

663
01:43:51,618 --> 01:43:54,663
<i>from longing,
from innocence, from her.</i>

664
01:43:54,793 --> 01:43:57,272
<i>Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.</i>

665
01:43:57,576 --> 01:44:00,447
<i>And as they've held me close...</i>

666
01:44:00,795 --> 01:44:05,100
<i>and asked if I will
remember them,</i>

667
01:44:05,101 --> 01:44:10,406
<i>I've said,
"Yes, I will remember you."</i>

668
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:14,451
<i>But the only one I've never forgotten
is the one who never asked...</i>

669
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:15,755
<i>Malena.</i>

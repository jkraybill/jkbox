1
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,792
Roll again. Roll again.

2
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,126
Eleven?

3
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,376
Nine.

4
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:11,584
What?

5
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,501
Four and five is nine,
not eleven.

6
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:18,376
It's good, it's good!

7
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,168
Four and five is nine,
not eleven.

8
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,043
- Throw again, brother.
- That's enough.

9
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,959
Hey, Tsotsi,
what we doing tonight?

10
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:31,542
Yeah, what we doing tonight?

11
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:01,834
Aha, the little gangster.

12
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,043
You learn to drive yet?

13
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:56,084
So I got sick.
So what?

14
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:01,292
- Come sit, Teacher Boy.
- Fuck off! I'm not your Teacher Boy!

15
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,043
You know you went too far tonight.

16
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:10,876
What's your name, Tsotsi?

17
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,792
Your real name?

18
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,751
Tsotsi? Thug?
That's not a real name.

19
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,334
- Boston, don't ask him questions.
- Why not?

20
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,459
I've been with you for six months.
I want to know his name.

21
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:25,626
Every man has a name.

22
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,876
A real name from his mother.

23
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:34,043
Hey, Soekie. Come on.
We're dry here.

24
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,459
Hey, you. Relax!
I'll come when I'm ready, okay?

25
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:51,417
Decency, Tsotsi.
You know the word?

26
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:54,459
- Decency?
- Soekie!

27
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,292
I got sick because there's
some decency left in me.

28
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:03,918
And that big man with the tie
had a lot of decency. And now?

29
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,542
- He's dead.
- Soekie!

30
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,666
Jesus, Butcher, fetch it yourself.
I'm trying to have a serious discussion.

31
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,501
Come sit, sonny.
Chill out.

32
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,667
Just remember,
I'll have no trouble in my place.

33
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,751
- Jesus!
- What?

34
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,001
Sick again?

35
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,292
Jesus!

36
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,626
Tonight, Tsotsi,

37
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,792
when we dropped that big man,

38
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:12,918
it was like that inside me.

39
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,542
Does anything do that to you?

40
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,001
A woman, Tsotsi?

41
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,667
Maybe you had a woman,
and when she left you,

42
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,417
it hurt.

43
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:28,584
And you bled.

44
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,667
Your father-Your father, Tsotsi.
Your father, where is he?

45
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,042
Your father and mother.
Where are they?

46
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,000
Jesus, Tsotsi! A dog?
What about a dog?

47
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,834
Tell that bastard
never to come here again.

48
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,833
John? John?

49
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,958
Open the gate!

50
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,334
The remote isn't working.
Open the gate!

51
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,209
Stop!

52
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,709
Pumla!

53
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,250
Yeah, that's the registration.

54
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,292
Just tell them the car's been stripped.
No baby.

55
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,791
Oh, fuck.

56
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:23,375
Jesus. You stink.

57
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,459
Quiet, baby.

58
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,292
Quiet.

59
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,832
Tsotsi!

60
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,083
- Hey, Tsotsi!
- Yeah, what?

61
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,917
It's us.

62
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,958
- Who?
- Aap and Butcher.

63
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,125
- We need to talk.
- About what?

64
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,458
About Boston.

65
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,833
- Where is he?
- Over at Soekie's.

66
00:20:00,374 --> 00:20:02,791
He can't work with us anymore.

67
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,167
Says who? You or him?

68
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,833
What's that, man?

69
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,833
- What?
- That smell.

70
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,666
- It's me.
- What's wrong?

71
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,750
I'm sick.

72
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,042
Shit. You need a doctor.

73
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,125
No, I'm fine.

74
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,209
Hey, sister!
Feed it, man!

75
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,500
Come feed him here.

76
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:35,625
If you got no milk,
let him suck me.

77
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:42,291
So, what are we doing tonight, Tsotsi?

78
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:46,541
Let's meet later.
At Park Station.

79
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,625
Later's good.
We'll meet later.

80
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,666
Okay.

81
00:20:55,625 --> 00:21:00,209
Hey, man. Did you smell that?
Stinks like shit.

82
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,833
You said there were fingerprints?

83
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,500
This bastard's a nobody.

84
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,167
But you said
he went into the township?

85
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:29,374
There's a million people in there.

86
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,791
- It's chaos.
- Sir, we can't even track stolen cars-

87
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,083
Stop telling me what you can't do!

88
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,208
I want my child found.

89
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:42,291
When my wife wakes up,
I want our son right here beside her.

90
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:43,917
Is that clear?

91
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,875
Where's Tsotsi, man?

92
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:03,583
- Fuck him, really.
- Sure. Fuck him.

93
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:10,083
Hey! Fucking look
where you're going!

94
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,291
Dog!

95
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,875
And now?
You want me to say sorry?

96
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,374
Watch where you put your feet.
Move!

97
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,333
Late edition, Daily Sun.

98
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,833
What's up, Bheki?

99
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,875
How you doing?

100
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,416
Tell me, who won?

101
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,791
Irish Fancy, brother.

102
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:05,166
By a length. Seven to two.

103
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,333
- Lame donkey.
- You see?

104
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,166
- Did you win anything?
- Win what? Fuck off.

105
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,374
Put a hundred on Red Bullet tomorrow.
You'll see.

106
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,416
Red Bullet has no legs.

107
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,458
Silver Lightning.

108
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,374
Don't take too much!

109
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,249
Where is that guy?

110
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:33,541
Hey, where'd you buy that license?

111
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,166
Did your mother teach you to drive?

112
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,666
What you want, boy?

113
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:32,500
Do you want my money?

114
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,458
- Stand up.
- What?

115
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,374
Get up and walk.

116
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:42,833
And who are you?
Jesus Christ?

117
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:46,708
- I'm a cripple.
- You're lying. Stand up.

118
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:50,458
Go to hell.

119
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,750
Fine.

120
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,416
Here's all the money I have.

121
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,082
What do you want from me?

122
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,708
Take the money
and leave me alone.

123
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:52,875
Fuck, man.
Fuck you!

124
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:55,833
Fuck you!

125
00:25:55,999 --> 00:26:00,208
Fuck! You fuck-
You fucking bastard!

126
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:03,041
Fuck you! Fuck you!

127
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:06,957
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, man!

128
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,166
Are you happy now?

129
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,666
You've made an old man
piss in his pants.

130
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,166
Why are you following me?

131
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:39,957
Why?

132
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,041
I saw a dog once.

133
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,208
Two kicks-

134
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,291
And its back was broken.

135
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,249
It crawled just like you.

136
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:27,999
What kind of man kicks a dog?

137
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:36,500
What happened to your legs?

138
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,541
I worked in the mines-

139
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,625
Digging for gold.

140
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,791
A beam fell on me

141
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,291
and it broke me.

142
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:04,124
Why do you go on
when you live like a dog?

143
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,957
I.

144
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,458
I like to feel the sun on the street.

145
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:20,874
Even with these hands,
I can still feel the heat.

146
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,291
Go pick up your money.

147
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:13,041
Okay, sir.
Enjoy your tea.

148
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,832
- Be well.
- Thank you.

149
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,458
What do you want?

150
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:20,333
Put them down.
Fuck you! Put them down!

151
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,665
Sit.

152
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:30,624
Sit.

153
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:32,582
Sit!

154
00:32:41,707 --> 00:32:43,582
Please don't hurt my baby.

155
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:46,790
I won't hurt him.
Put him down.

156
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,582
In the bag.

157
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,500
What?

158
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:19,999
Look in the bag.

159
00:33:24,665 --> 00:33:26,041
Hey, look in the bag!

160
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:35,999
Feed it.

161
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,665
I'm not leaving until you feed it.

162
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:40,999
Feed it!

163
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,957
Okay.

164
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,499
You made this?

165
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:08,665
Yes.

166
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,249
Why is it rusted?

167
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:16,999
I was sad.

168
00:35:38,415 --> 00:35:39,999
And this one?

169
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,333
You were happy?

170
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,208
Yes.

171
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,333
Better?

172
00:36:11,373 --> 00:36:13,415
You have something now, right?

173
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,415
You can do something?

174
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:19,041
Yes, this will help.

175
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:22,999
You find him.

176
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:25,832
And you tell him,

177
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:30,082
if he has hurt my child in anyway,

178
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,707
I will kill him with my own hands.

179
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:52,124
He's full.

180
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,707
Put him back.

181
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:02,832
Where is his mother?

182
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,874
He's mine.

183
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,540
Put him back.

184
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:22,249
Can I wash him first?

185
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,041
There you are, little one.

186
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:44,290
You want me to wash you?

187
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:47,707
You do, don't you?

188
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:42,207
Tell anyone, and I'll kill you.

189
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:07,790
Come on, brother!
Come on, brother!

190
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,415
Seven!

191
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,790
Bullshit! Seven, what?
Three and five is eight, you moron.

192
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:21,332
Eight is close!
Lend me 50, Fela!

193
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:24,373
Fifty bucks. Shit!
But I feel your pain.

194
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:26,373
You're rich, man.

195
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:28,749
- What's 50 to you?
- Fifty, to me?

196
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,582
End of the day, 50 lets me buy beer
for losers like you.

197
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:33,665
- Sure, win then.
- Fuck off.

198
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,457
Throw again.

199
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,457
Who does this look like?

200
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:43,665
- Tsotsi, no?
- No, man.

201
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:48,332
- What's it say'?
- Says he shot a woman.

202
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:50,624
Stole her car,
with her child inside.

203
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:53,207
What kind of man
does shit like that?

204
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:55,415
No, it's not Tsotsi.

205
00:39:56,499 --> 00:40:00,373
It's not Tsotsi.
He can't drive.

206
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:02,916
Fela, remember?
You tried to teach him?

207
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,832
He drove your 320 smack into a bus,
down Koma road,

208
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,957
in front of the police station.

209
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:09,957
Remember?
It's not Tsotsi.

210
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:13,165
Yes, I remember!
Don't be angry, Soekie.

211
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:15,165
Hey, that Tsotsi-

212
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:19,999
You know what?
You should all be working for me.

213
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,082
Stop this messing around.

214
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:24,540
You too, Teacher Boy.

215
00:40:24,624 --> 00:40:28,707
Or are you gonna take that beating
and go crawling back like a woman?

216
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:32,165
Tsotsi never went to school.

217
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:34,749
Doesn't understand decency.

218
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:38,290
You know about that, Fela?
Decency?

219
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,874
Hey, man.

220
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:43,832
Don't start with
your fucking big words.

221
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:48,916
Can't even spell the word,
can you?

222
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,916
Decency? Let's see.

223
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:54,665
D-E-C-E-N-C-Y. Decency.

224
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:57,207
- How's that?
- What's it mean?

225
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,916
Decency means making
a fucking decent living, sonny.

226
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:03,540
Respect, man.

227
00:41:03,582 --> 00:41:05,290
For yourself.

228
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:08,248
It's got fucking nothing to do
with your standard of living.

229
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
You want respect?

230
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:14,957
You'll get respect

231
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:18,790
the day you give up the bottle
and get a driver's license.

232
00:41:18,957 --> 00:41:21,415
I need drivers, not drinkers.

233
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:24,582
So, fuck your decency.

234
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,332
Yeah.

235
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:31,415
Fuck my decency.

236
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,332
Hey, fuck off, you.
Play.

237
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,332
Anytime,

238
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,874
if you need help,

239
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:43,790
just ask.

240
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:48,665
Quick and silent.

241
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:52,415
Old style.

242
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:56,957
Play.

243
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:53,790
David.

244
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:56,998
Come here.

245
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,874
Come and hold my hand.

246
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,290
Don't be afraid.

247
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:10,749
Don't be afraid.

248
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:28,248
What are you doing?

249
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:33,707
I want him near me, Mandla.

250
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:36,373
My son, go outside.

251
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:39,749
Now!

252
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:44,290
- Please, Mandla.
- Quiet, woman.

253
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,749
You know you are sick.

254
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,582
What if he gets sick like you?

255
00:43:49,665 --> 00:43:51,540
It's all right, my baby.

256
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:53,540
- It's all right.
- You.

257
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:56,207
Stay away from your mother.

258
00:43:58,457 --> 00:43:59,665
I said out.

259
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:02,248
Get out, damn it!

260
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:12,707
Fucking dog!

261
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:18,332
Out! Fucking dog!

262
00:44:46,873 --> 00:44:48,123
Leave it.

263
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,415
My son.

264
00:45:02,582 --> 00:45:04,248
Don't look at me like that.

265
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,165
David!

266
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:13,332
David!

267
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:18,081
<i>- David!
- Tsotsi!</i>

268
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,165
Hey, Tsotsi!

269
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:25,665
- Who's it?
- It's me, Aap.

270
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:27,665
Open up!

271
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:36,040
What you want?

272
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:39,499
- Hey, man, I'm just dropping by.
- For what?

273
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:43,665
I always drop by.
I'm just dropping by.

274
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:51,040
Hi.

275
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,207
- Where's Butcher'?
- He won't come.

276
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:59,540
He's angry.
Says you done a job on your own.

277
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:01,081
Maybe I did. So what?

278
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:04,457
Yeah, that's what I told him,
“Maybe you did, so what?”

279
00:46:07,873 --> 00:46:11,081
But now he says,
“Let's go join Fela.”

280
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:13,998
So, what you doing here?

281
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,915
Years, man.

282
00:46:18,165 --> 00:46:20,457
You and me, we've been together.

283
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:24,415
The two of us,
since we were kids.

284
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,498
And all those years
you've just been following me.

285
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:30,540
“Hey, Tsotsi, what we doing tonight?”
“Hey, it's good, it's good.”

286
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:34,789
Fuck! Why can't you
decide things for yourself?

287
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:46,373
Okay, fine.

288
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:48,373
But we can start over again.

289
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:53,831
Like when Vusi and Peter were shot.
It felt like this.

290
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,457
But we started over again.

291
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:01,457
We found Boston and Butcher.
And we started over again.

292
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:10,415
- What?
- Yeah, what?

293
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:16,457
You know what, brother?
This time, it's finished.

294
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,873
Finished and done.

295
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,998
Go join Fela's gang.
I can't help you anymore.

296
00:47:25,373 --> 00:47:26,457
Sorry.

297
00:47:28,748 --> 00:47:30,248
Tsotsi.

298
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,789
What?

299
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:48,789
You want to go back
to your big fancy house?

300
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:50,207
What?

301
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:54,624
You want to go home?

302
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,706
I'll show you a home.

303
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,207
What you want?

304
00:49:11,457 --> 00:49:13,581
What's in the bag?

305
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,540
Let me see.

306
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:32,457
- What you doing with that?
- Why? You want it?

307
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,623
Here.

308
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:40,623
Fuck off.
We can't feed it.

309
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,207
Did his mother die?

310
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:16,373
You see that pipe.
Top row. Left corner.

311
00:50:16,457 --> 00:50:19,248
Yes. It's theirs.

312
00:50:20,248 --> 00:50:22,040
Used to be mine.

313
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:24,789
Where you staying now?

314
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:29,040
I have my own place.

315
00:50:29,123 --> 00:50:31,498
So, why bring your baby to us?

316
00:50:32,664 --> 00:50:35,789
He wants him to see his old house.

317
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:07,539
Where've you been?

318
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,123
Quiet. Quiet, baby.

319
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,332
Hurry up.

320
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:15,332
Hurry, please!

321
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,873
Quiet.

322
00:51:29,831 --> 00:51:31,456
Feed him.

323
00:51:55,831 --> 00:51:57,748
Drink, baby.

324
00:52:00,956 --> 00:52:04,373
Drink, you hear?
Drink, so you can grow big.

325
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,789
What's your name, little one?

326
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:10,873
What's your name?

327
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:14,081
What shall I call you?

328
00:52:16,873 --> 00:52:18,372
David.

329
00:52:21,414 --> 00:52:22,706
Yes.

330
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:25,623
His name is David.

331
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,956
Yes, David.

332
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:33,081
Now you are drinking.

333
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:38,040
Are you his father?

334
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:41,372
No.

335
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,207
What happened to his mother?

336
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,873
Is she dead?

337
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:55,081
Where is your baby's father?

338
00:53:01,498 --> 00:53:03,915
Last winter,

339
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:06,372
he went to work one day,

340
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:11,207
and he never came back.

341
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:15,539
It was dark. After five.

342
00:53:16,248 --> 00:53:20,207
It's a long walk home
from the factory.

343
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:24,581
You don't always see
who is walking behind you.

344
00:53:35,956 --> 00:53:37,873
What was his name?

345
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:43,456
Zachariah.

346
00:53:56,998 --> 00:53:59,331
How do you get money?

347
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:03,831
- Do you sew?
- Yes, I sew.

348
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:06,664
And I mend clothes.

349
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:14,623
What about these things?

350
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:18,207
Can you sell them?

351
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:21,998
I've sold some.

352
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:23,539
Not many.

353
00:54:25,414 --> 00:54:28,664
How much for that one?

354
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:30,623
Fifty.

355
00:54:31,498 --> 00:54:34,372
Fifty! For broken glass?

356
00:54:34,748 --> 00:54:37,789
- You see only broken glass.
- What do you see?

357
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:39,915
Color. Light. On you.

358
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:42,123
Can't you see'?

359
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,956
Give him to me.

360
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:58,998
Give me the baby.
I'll take care of him.

361
00:55:02,706 --> 00:55:04,748
You can come see him anytime.

362
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:08,956
My Jabu and David will play together.

363
00:55:09,956 --> 00:55:13,081
I know about babies.
I'll look after him.

364
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:16,623
Give him to me.

365
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:30,331
I'll be back in the morning.
He better be here.

366
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,581
Where are you going?

367
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:35,331
To get money.
So I can pay for your milk.

368
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:39,164
- I don't want your money.
- Yes, you do.

369
00:55:39,456 --> 00:55:40,915
No, I don't.

370
00:55:43,998 --> 00:55:47,623
Don't forget.
He's mine.

371
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,748
Keep still!
You must keep it clean.

372
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,706
You never had a child, did you?

373
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:20,789
Hey, don't be rude,
I'm helping you.

374
00:56:21,414 --> 00:56:23,456
You are clever, Boston.

375
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:25,581
You should go back to school.

376
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:27,873
School costs money.

377
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,498
We should go work for Fela.

378
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:32,831
We'll make plenty of money.

379
00:56:32,873 --> 00:56:35,247
He can work here with me.

380
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:38,289
He'll drink all your profit, sister!

381
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:42,956
Leave him alone, please.

382
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:46,831
Get out!

383
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:52,372
I don't want you here.

384
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,414
- He can come stay with me.
- What?

385
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:04,873
You think he wants to be with you?

386
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:07,164
Look at his face.

387
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:09,414
Look at the mess you've made.

388
00:57:09,915 --> 00:57:12,040
And now it's infected.

389
00:57:12,873 --> 00:57:14,789
Say what you want to say and leave.

390
00:57:19,664 --> 00:57:23,080
I remember when he first came here-
to the shacks-

391
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:26,998
I remember he had a lot of money.
You gave him as much beer as he wanted.

392
00:57:27,164 --> 00:57:29,706
- He came here to forget.
- Yes.

393
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:32,080
And when he fell down in the street,

394
00:57:32,122 --> 00:57:34,498
sick from the beer you sold him,

395
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:36,706
I found him.
Not you.

396
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,873
Brother.

397
00:57:42,956 --> 00:57:45,581
Who took care of you
when you were lying there in the street?

398
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:48,414
Lying in your own vomit.

399
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:53,122
Who cleaned you up when you
couldn't even remember your name?

400
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:55,998
Who picked you up then,
brother, huh?

401
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,456
Me or her?

402
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,247
Help him back to my place.

403
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:22,164
Why did you bring me here?

404
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:26,289
You were a teacher, right?

405
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,080
I was never a teacher.

406
00:58:34,706 --> 00:58:36,414
I never took the exam.

407
00:58:37,873 --> 00:58:38,956
Don't laugh.

408
00:58:46,498 --> 00:58:48,164
You still can.

409
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:51,372
I can't go back.

410
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:54,748
You need money.
We will help you.

411
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:01,206
We will get money,
and you will take the exam.

412
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:03,498
- Yes.
- You see?

413
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:09,080
We need to do a job.

414
00:59:15,997 --> 00:59:17,414
Where are we going?

415
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:20,039
We're going. That's all.
It's good.

416
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:31,789
Tell me, why are we here?

417
00:59:33,706 --> 00:59:35,498
Stop asking him questions.

418
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:39,289
Why this house?

419
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,372
Drop it.
We're working together, right?

420
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,498
Why are we sitting here?

421
00:59:47,122 --> 00:59:48,706
We're sitting.

422
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:50,789
It's good.

423
01:00:41,414 --> 01:00:44,414
- Shut the alarm off.
- It's over there.

424
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:50,789
Don't make any mistakes.

425
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:54,623
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

426
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:56,955
Move!

427
01:01:09,748 --> 01:01:11,331
Sit.

428
01:01:19,164 --> 01:01:20,830
Where's your wife?

429
01:01:22,122 --> 01:01:24,122
In the hospital.

430
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:27,039
She was shot three days ago.

431
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:30,664
Please, guys.

432
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,331
Take everything,
but my wife needs me.

433
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:36,498
Our child is missing.

434
01:01:37,748 --> 01:01:41,456
- Let me kill this guy now!
- No. Later.

435
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:45,289
- Why later?
- We might need him.

436
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:48,414
What for?

437
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,206
Do you have a safe here?

438
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,664
There's no safe.

439
01:02:00,122 --> 01:02:01,788
We'll see.

440
01:02:03,414 --> 01:02:05,456
He's seen our faces.

441
01:02:05,623 --> 01:02:08,456
I said later, okay?
Just do what I say.

442
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,247
You Okay?

443
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:36,872
What's going on with you?

444
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,039
Hey, buddy.
They say each wine is different.

445
01:02:51,206 --> 01:02:52,414
Is that true?

446
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:54,581
Sure.

447
01:02:55,456 --> 01:02:57,039
You get used to the taste.

448
01:02:58,039 --> 01:02:59,206
Sure.

449
01:03:05,788 --> 01:03:09,247
I prefer beer, Zamalek.

450
01:03:58,539 --> 01:03:59,581
Hey, buddy.

451
01:04:00,788 --> 01:04:04,122
I'm hungry.
Do you want something?

452
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:07,623
Sure.

453
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:15,663
Hey, buddy, what do you have?

454
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,997
Cheese, cold meats, sausages?

455
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,872
- Chicken livers?
- Sure. In the fridge.

456
01:05:09,581 --> 01:05:11,039
Shit!

457
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:18,747
What you doing? They haven't finished!
Are you stupid?

458
01:05:20,331 --> 01:05:21,830
Look what you've done!

459
01:05:21,914 --> 01:05:24,580
- It wasn't me, man! Look in his hands.
- What were you doing, huh?

460
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:25,955
I didn't see!

461
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:20,164
What you doing?
You know you can't drive!

462
01:07:20,247 --> 01:07:22,247
- Get in!
- Open the gate!

463
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:24,497
Get in the car!

464
01:07:28,538 --> 01:07:30,830
- What have you done?
- He was shit!

465
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:33,289
He's dead. He's dead!

466
01:07:33,372 --> 01:07:36,080
Yes, he's dead.
With him it was always kill, kill, kill!

467
01:07:36,164 --> 01:07:38,663
You never stopped him before!

468
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:17,788
Okay, let's do it.

469
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:23,080
Buddy, if you had learned
to drive properly, I'd give you more.

470
01:08:26,914 --> 01:08:28,830
Move!

471
01:08:33,331 --> 01:08:34,830
Let's go.

472
01:08:39,206 --> 01:08:40,872
Come on, brother!

473
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:46,289
You want to stay with Fela?

474
01:08:48,206 --> 01:08:49,914
When is it my turn?

475
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:53,955
- For what?
- You fucked up Boston, real bad.

476
01:08:54,705 --> 01:08:56,455
Now Butcher.

477
01:08:58,371 --> 01:08:59,622
When is it my turn?

478
01:09:08,455 --> 01:09:11,331
You're right.
We're finished.

479
01:09:14,247 --> 01:09:15,455
It's over.

480
01:09:15,914 --> 01:09:17,331
Like Butcher.

481
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,122
Finished and done, boy.

482
01:10:22,122 --> 01:10:23,788
- Who is it'?
- It's me.

483
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,955
What happened?

484
01:10:31,955 --> 01:10:33,538
Can I come in?

485
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:38,413
Please.

486
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,497
Thank you.

487
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,622
It's for you.

488
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:37,705
I don't want it.

489
01:11:37,872 --> 01:11:39,663
I won at craps.

490
01:11:41,413 --> 01:11:43,246
I don't want it.

491
01:11:51,413 --> 01:11:53,371
I know where you got him.

492
01:11:59,455 --> 01:12:01,538
I saw the newspaper.

493
01:12:03,122 --> 01:12:06,039
They say his mother
may never walk again.

494
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:11,955
You can't give back her legs,

495
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,288
but you must give back her son.

496
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:30,622
What's this?

497
01:12:31,205 --> 01:12:34,455
Milk.
For mothers without milk.

498
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,705
You put it in here, right?

499
01:12:38,705 --> 01:12:40,122
Yes!

500
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,622
But it won't make you his mother.

501
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,497
Please, give him to me.

502
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,497
I'll take him back for you.

503
01:13:21,955 --> 01:13:24,330
If I take him back,

504
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:26,413
can I still come here?

505
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:29,246
Boston.

506
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:52,038
I'm sorry, my brother.

507
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:51,246
Hello? Yes, I told you,
Western Section.

508
01:16:51,705 --> 01:16:54,497
Just behind the bar.

509
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,371
I see you.

510
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:06,163
- Where is he?
- That shack. With the small window.

511
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,580
Watch the car.

512
01:17:11,871 --> 01:17:14,788
- Hey, you! Where's the baby?
- What baby?

513
01:17:14,954 --> 01:17:17,288
- Get the gun!
- Talk! Talk fast, boy!

514
01:17:17,455 --> 01:17:20,163
- I don't know anything.
- Don't bullshit us!

515
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,788
No. Stop!
That's not him!

516
01:17:23,288 --> 01:17:25,205
What are you saying, Ma'am?

517
01:17:25,871 --> 01:17:27,455
Talk, Boston!
Where'd he go?

518
01:17:27,622 --> 01:17:29,497
I don't know.

519
01:17:29,663 --> 01:17:31,371
Take it easy, Zuma.

520
01:17:34,038 --> 01:17:37,205
Hey, tell me the truth.
I'm not stupid.

521
01:17:37,288 --> 01:17:39,205
I'm not lying!
It's true, man!

522
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:36,747
You!

523
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,996
What do you want?

524
01:18:53,622 --> 01:18:55,747
Take it.

525
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:44,163
You need anything,
help yourself.

526
01:20:44,246 --> 01:20:46,954
No, sir. This is fine.
Thank you.

527
01:21:19,662 --> 01:21:21,079
Thanks.

528
01:21:38,205 --> 01:21:39,205
<i>Come on, people.</i>

529
01:21:39,371 --> 01:21:44,497
A child was stolen by someone
who lives on this street

530
01:21:45,704 --> 01:21:47,662
and nobody's seen anything?

531
01:21:47,704 --> 01:21:49,954
Hello. Yes?

532
01:22:48,038 --> 01:22:51,913
- Pumla, eat, please.
- John, I can't.

533
01:23:05,288 --> 01:23:06,371
Hello.

534
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:09,787
Hello.

535
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:13,913
I'll leave it here.

536
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:16,163
Who is this?

537
01:23:18,205 --> 01:23:20,662
Your baby- I'll leave it here.

538
01:23:23,913 --> 01:23:27,288
Don't do anything stupid, guys.
We're coming.

539
01:23:31,163 --> 01:23:33,038
- Please, sir. Wait.
- Out of my way!

540
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:52,537
Put the child down and step away!

541
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:55,288
Please stay inside, sir!

542
01:23:59,746 --> 01:24:02,371
Please, I beg you.

543
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,704
Just stay where you are.

544
01:24:11,496 --> 01:24:15,163
- Put the child down!
- Hey, please, take it easy.

545
01:24:16,163 --> 01:24:17,996
That's my child he's holding.

546
01:24:20,913 --> 01:24:23,288
John, what's going on?

547
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:26,537
Pumla, go back inside, please.

548
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:28,704
Hey, back away, Ma'am!

549
01:24:28,787 --> 01:24:30,954
Steyn, pull her back!

550
01:24:30,996 --> 01:24:33,163
Don't you touch me!

551
01:24:46,496 --> 01:24:47,704
Boy.

552
01:24:48,163 --> 01:24:49,829
Bring me my child.

553
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:54,913
Bring my child to me!

554
01:25:03,038 --> 01:25:04,829
Hey, put the child down
and back away!

555
01:25:04,996 --> 01:25:09,079
Quiet, man!
Let us deal with this, please!

556
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:16,454
Tell your men
to lower their weapons.

557
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:18,913
This boy is going nowhere.

558
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:24,246
All right, everybody.
Don't do anything stupid. Relax.

559
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,704
You too.
Lower your gun, please.

560
01:25:46,829 --> 01:25:47,913
Brother.

561
01:25:50,163 --> 01:25:52,121
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

562
01:25:55,038 --> 01:25:58,038
I promise.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

563
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:04,454
I'm going to open
the gate now, okay?

564
01:26:05,205 --> 01:26:07,787
You stay there.
I'll come to you.

565
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:11,079
I'm opening it now.

566
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:14,288
Is that okay?

567
01:26:14,412 --> 01:26:15,704
All right?

568
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:18,288
I'm opening it.

569
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:44,871
I'm coming now.

570
01:28:16,954 --> 01:28:19,746
Put your hands above your head.

571
01:28:22,121 --> 01:28:25,871
I said, put your hands
above your head.

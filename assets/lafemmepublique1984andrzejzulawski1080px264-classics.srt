1
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,581
THE PUBLIC WOMAN

2
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,666
Do you like dogs, sweetheart?

3
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,211
- Is he yours?
- He's been following me all day.

4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,507
Someday you'll have a dog
too. That's a fantastic animal.

5
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:16,407
What do you want?

6
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,868
Please.

7
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:21,787
Give this to the man with the dog.

8
00:01:22,788 --> 00:01:24,498
But don't tell him how you got it.

9
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:28,044
Wow, that's his lucky day.
With all the money he owes.

10
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:31,422
Hey, what makes you so
sure I'll give him the money?

11
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,382
I have faith.

12
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,930
Lea, here girl.

13
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:43,267
Hey, you've got
money! You can pay me back!

14
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,061
No!

15
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:50,816
Stop it, guys!

16
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,751
I was working on the balcony
in the fresh air,

17
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:11,379
when I saw, walking
under the trees nearby...

18
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:15,508
When I saw, walking under
the trees nearby,

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,095
an elegant young man, who
humbly bowed as soon as he saw me.

20
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:24,392
Out of politeness, I
curtseyed back to him.

21
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:27,144
All of a sudden...

22
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,230
He bows again.

23
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:33,985
So do I.

24
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:38,322
He walks, approaches,

25
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,159
and goes, each time bowing.

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,084
And each time, I would curtsey
back, looking at him intensely.

27
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:56,299
If the night hadn't come, I
would still be standing there,

28
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:02,430
refusing that he might
think me less courteous than he.

29
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:12,356
Do you have any theater experience?

30
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,716
Or cinema?

31
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:18,112
Have you taken classes?

32
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:19,989
Yes. In Genevilliers.

33
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:21,907
- With General?
- Yes.

34
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:24,368
It's been a while
since he worked there.

35
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:28,372
My teacher was an actor. From Paris.

36
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,292
I don't have any pictures.

37
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:34,211
It doesn't matter.
We have your details.

38
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,632
We'll call you. Can you
follow me, please? Thank you.

39
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,220
I'm Lucas Kesling, the director.

40
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,514
- Can I walk you out?
- Why?

41
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:49,727
Because I want to, and I want
to talk to you about the film.

42
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,241
So we're being told that independent
cinema is dead.

43
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:09,203
It's more the end of an era,
because cinema accompanies everything else.

44
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:11,040
It is very difficult
to make a dumb film,

45
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:15,252
especially when you have a voice
inside, saying that cinema is better than that.

46
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:33,041
This is why I want to play Nicolas, the
main character of "The Possessed".

47
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:38,401
He is ice cold, he's
the vice, the cynicism,

48
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:42,446
the intelligence personified, and...

49
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,577
Do you understand?

50
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,122
Yes.

51
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,419
I don't like your hair.

52
00:04:57,837 --> 00:05:00,631
Do you like how I bleached mine?

53
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:12,268
<i>The Lithuanian
Archbishop arrived this afternoon.</i>

54
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,651
<i>His Grace was welcomed by a small committee
of Lithuanian expatriates.</i>

55
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,265
Shit, shit...

56
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:30,036
<i>His Grace has spent a month in Rome
and is about to return to the USSR,</i>

57
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:35,164
<i>where the Church has recently seen an unexpected
revival due to his influence.</i>

58
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:40,254
<i>The 75-year-old prelate previously
spent fifteen years in Siberian prisons.</i>

59
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,924
<i>The Russian authorities
consider him to be an increasing threat.</i>

60
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,092
Not another one...

61
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:48,721
<i>Will His Grace be able to follow
Polish Cardinal Woïtila's example-</i>

62
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,227
Always late!

63
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:56,354
Hello.

64
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,608
There you go. Mr.
André arrived a little early.

65
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:04,320
You did choose
Miss Ethel, didn't you?

66
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,865
What are you waiting
for? Studio one is free.

67
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:16,969
With the composition, we
reach this sort of abstraction that...

68
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:18,973
Did I ask you anything?

69
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,231
Do you have an envelope?

70
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,240
What do you do to all those men?

71
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:38,534
I scare them.

72
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:42,204
You've come a long way.

73
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,082
Do you want to show me?

74
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,660
Here's my little girl!

75
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:26,624
We were waiting on you
yesterday at lunch time, but not today...

76
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,627
- I was modeling for Prisunic.
- And?

77
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:30,753
Nothing.

78
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,799
- How is he?
- He's fine. He's fine.

79
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:41,389
Do you want some soup?

80
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:44,517
I can reheat some soup if you want.

81
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,936
And some meatballs.

82
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:49,480
You like my meatballs, don't you?

83
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:55,152
It's pointless being a
model if you end up starving.

84
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,573
And don't stay alone,
with the hours you work.

85
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,241
Did you get your hair cut?

86
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:03,618
Don't you like it?

87
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:05,204
Salomon says it
makes me look younger.

88
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,331
And you put on weight, that's good.

89
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,671
Ethel!

90
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,508
I was about to go.

91
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,678
She's doing very
well. She's sleeping better.

92
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:25,141
Look what I made for my beauty
who's going to look like a Page!

93
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,935
- Can I try it on?
- Eat first.

94
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:31,188
How's the restaurant
going? Are you not too tired?

95
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,359
When he's not on night shift, he's
not going to bed before 2 a. m.

96
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:39,030
Salomon, your boss can wait
a minute. Take a picture of us.

97
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:42,199
It's not often she
comes to visit her mother.

98
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,745
He's not sick, is he?

99
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,870
You're the one who's sick.

100
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,582
Don't say that.

101
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:55,880
I've always been a
bit crazy, you know?

102
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:58,174
And Salomon?

103
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:09,894
At his age! He's in
love, just like a young man.

104
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:24,408
Thanks, darling. Thank you.

105
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,827
Why do you do that?

106
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,539
Did you speak to him this
time? Your father, I mean.

107
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:34,752
Sorry, it's the last time I ask you.

108
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:36,963
I didn't have the courage.

109
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,425
At least he'll be able to subsist.

110
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:43,511
Mom, stop it!

111
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,429
I don't want to go anymore.

112
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,139
Next time, I'll go.

113
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:50,601
Sure. And then you'll
call me to come and get you,

114
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,813
because you want to
live, live, live, and not die!

115
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,529
Has he changed?

116
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,324
Does he still send you
those letters, just to hurt you?

117
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:10,788
To make fun of you even more?

118
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,960
We are the ones who are
killing him, Ethel.

119
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,713
We're just repaying him in kind.

120
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,631
You're so violent!

121
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:22,967
He's the violent one!

122
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:28,139
He's...
disgusting, vicious, and crazy!

123
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:33,185
But do we have the right? Can we?

124
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:38,316
How can you answer that
question when someone's hurting you?

125
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,152
You know, don't
you? I don't, you know.

126
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:44,739
Or maybe nobody told me how. I've
always done what I'm told.

127
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,574
I've always listened to others!

128
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:52,246
Stop it, it's not your fault!

129
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,791
It's nobody's fault!

130
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:23,235
Miss, hold the elevator!

131
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:30,242
"SOLIDARITY WITH THE WORKERS OF"...

132
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,091
If you keep doing it, I'll
be able to feel pain.

133
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,652
Are you here to see me?

134
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:08,656
- Do you live nearby?
- Well, yes. Just here.

135
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,493
You know, my producer is
insane, but maybe not enough.

136
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:17,581
He's cutting the budget, he
doesn't give me enough days to shoot.

137
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,584
And in the end, he expects
this movie to be prestigious.

138
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:24,088
Pussyfooting as
usual. Goodbye, Miss...?

139
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,340
Ethel.

140
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:30,386
That's it.

141
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:49,322
I forgot to tell you.

142
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,700
I'd like you to read the
part I just told you about.

143
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,953
I don't believe in the traditional
auditioning process.

144
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:59,624
Tomorrow, we'll just
rehearse. Like in theater.

145
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:01,584
You'll see for yourself.

146
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,002
I'll call you.

147
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,968
Thank you.

148
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:17,683
"The Possessed".

149
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,647
No. Thank you.

150
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:26,651
Thanks.

151
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:34,158
This is a prophetic tale about those who
try to change the world through violence.

152
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,122
This is why Dostoyevsky's book was banned
in Eastern European countries.

153
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:46,587
That's why we live in the shadows
and in the continuity of what is there.

154
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:53,427
We bury our heads in the sand, like
ostriches, to remain ignorant.

155
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:58,766
Some of you are actors. Some
aren't. Just as in real life.

156
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,433
- Barbara.
- Yes.

157
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:05,690
Thank you. I hope you'll explain to
everyone that will see this film,

158
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:09,694
that it is a contemporary
story, not just a classic.

159
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,679
Shall we?

160
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,285
Read your scripts.

161
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,206
I don't care if you don't know your lines, I'm going to watch you
- live!

162
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:24,667
Put that cigarette out, please.

163
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:31,465
Thank you for
receiving me and my sister.

164
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:34,302
My sister, the Stranger!

165
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,887
What do you mean, "the Stranger"?

166
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:42,226
Madam, I wrote you a
letter about your son.

167
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:47,461
And the letter of a worm, of a rat,

168
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:54,092
of a bacillus even,
must be read like poetry!

169
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:58,451
Of a bacillus?

170
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,373
Your laugh. More insane!
More insane!

171
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,758
More insane, this laugh!

172
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,927
The sitting room is yours,
jump, twirl around! Quick, quick!

173
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:18,661
Go!

174
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:22,099
Everyone is here! It is
so wonderful... but...

175
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:26,270
What are you doing here,
Captain? Who let you in? With this idiot.

176
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,939
- Sir, my honor doesn't
allow me to- - Your what?

177
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:31,317
I said I would arrange
everything. And the money...

178
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:36,697
My dear, your son will arrive soon. If
only you knew what happened in Germany.

179
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:40,825
But he will tell you much better than
I! Do you know he traveled through Iceland?

180
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,289
The island of ice and
fire. Oh, Christian!

181
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,126
Your son's good soul is holding
the simple conscience of the world.

182
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:53,172
And my father, steeped in
pity, even in his very posture.

183
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:54,966
My son, I was expecting different
signs of affection.

184
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:57,635
Son? Son? Do you think
this is the right word?

185
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,470
Let me remind you
that I only met you twice,

186
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:02,264
when I was born and when
I went to University!

187
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,225
You don't have the
right! A writer can have...

188
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:08,813
Right, family,
duty, society: Literature!

189
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,526
This aristocracy where rottenness can
be found hidden behind the couch.

190
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:18,364
This joke will cease to be funny
when it turns to blood.

191
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,331
And I enter. I mean, Nicolas enters.

192
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:30,042
You all look at me. Attention.

193
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,253
Nicolas, my son...

194
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,631
More beautiful, more gifted,
more unique, more brilliant than ever!

195
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:41,470
Is it true that for a bet, you
legally and religiously married this idiot...

196
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,745
No...

197
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:48,060
Is that true, for a bet, you
legally and religiously married this idiot...

198
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:56,027
And who are you, Miss?

199
00:19:56,527 --> 00:20:00,656
And now you look at him
and without expecting it,

200
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,784
all of a sudden, you
fall in love with him.

201
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,666
And he falls with you too.

202
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,553
- Well, thank you.
- By participating in this film, you are committing suicide...

203
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:26,766
Not bad. Tomorrow, don't forget to
use some white pencil above the eyelashes.

204
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,394
No powder on the temples, it makes
your eyes smaller, makes you look stubborn.

205
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:34,940
You need to project the light
towards us, not the other way around.

206
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:36,466
Yes, sir.

207
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:41,238
Inflexible... do you remember the
article I wrote about Sartre in 1962?

208
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:09,183
Yes, sir?

209
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,777
Can you come with me?

210
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:03,696
Yes.

211
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,104
That's it! Just create
goddamned chaos! Another attempt, comrade!

212
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,741
Where are we?

213
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,534
A hotel!

214
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,873
- Is there no reception?
- No!

215
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,926
Why shoot all your films
in Germany? You're French...

216
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,678
I'm not French.

217
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,347
Or even German.

218
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:15,559
My mom was French.

219
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:20,648
I shot my movies in Germany because it
was the only place I could do it my way.

220
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,567
Films "against"...

221
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,361
Against what?

222
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:31,534
Against... those who
no longer fear God.

223
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:19,540
- Hurry up, we're almost ready.
- Ready for what?

224
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:22,335
I told you several times, I
don't want this powder there.

225
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,677
Just like this.

226
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,098
Damn it, the dress!

227
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:42,897
Can't you see it's
useless? Pick another one, come on.

228
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:45,232
Are you stupid, or what?

229
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,362
Ethel! I need to speak to you.

230
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:56,909
Do you like it?

231
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,550
Scratch the sole. It
will be less slippery.

232
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,248
Listen, you don't look
like the son of a servant.

233
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,669
You studied with Nicolas,
you wear Nicolas' clothes,

234
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,587
but they are too short for you.

235
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,215
Give it to me.

236
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,345
Let's shoot!

237
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:44,292
Lights!

238
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,877
"The Possessed", Scene 32, Take 1.

239
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:50,965
Action.

240
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,009
Nicolas, is that true that,
for a stupid bet, you legally and

241
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:56,971
religiously married this idiot?

242
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,475
Pierre, would you accompany
this lady?

243
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:04,603
Of course, immediately. I told you
it was only a misunderstanding.

244
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,649
Being a generous man, Nicolas was being
charitable to those poor souls.

245
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,776
Leave, fool...

246
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:23,372
What do you mean, "fool"? "Fool"?

247
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:26,917
I have money, madam!

248
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:28,628
Leave.

249
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,467
What did I tell you? I'll
take care of everything.

250
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:39,930
And this is Lise. She is pretty,
isn't she? Young, intelligent, sensitive...

251
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,431
Pierre, your
behavior is unacceptable.

252
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:44,268
Speak, you intellectual, idiot...

253
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,233
Let me introduce you
to my fiancé, Maurice.

254
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:03,703
The problem is that if I had no
legs, we could not walk together...

255
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,998
You so tall and I so short.

256
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,962
Try again. More tensed. More
nervous. You're trying to be funny. Now!

257
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:17,093
You would come with me if I was
deformed, destitute and limping, with no legs.

258
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,475
The problem is that if I had no
legs we could not walk together.

259
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:32,858
The problem is that if I had no
legs we could not walk together.

260
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:35,885
Nicolas...

261
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,283
I demand an answer. I am your
mother. I want to know.

262
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:45,037
No, mother. I did not
marry this infortunate.

263
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,582
Liar... liar...

264
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,543
Why? Why?!

265
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,978
Cut!

266
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,030
Sorry, Lili. Everybody step
out of the lights, please.

267
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,100
Impressive!

268
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:28,164
Thanks, I didn't fall properly. I
wasn't thinking. I'd like to do another take.

269
00:28:30,124 --> 00:28:31,709
3, 7, and 1.

270
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:43,888
Change of scene! Quicker!

271
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,108
That night, I
played my life for you.

272
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,986
I was happy to do it...

273
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:01,155
Because I love you.

274
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:05,910
Don't push me away.

275
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,582
Keep me with you.

276
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:25,638
When I see you like this, I think
that you are hiding something dark...

277
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:28,182
Or even have blood on your hands!

278
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,436
My head hurts... so much...

279
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,234
Congratulations my
friend, you are a widower.

280
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:42,697
We just found your wife and her
brother at home, their throats slit open.

281
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:47,326
Do you remember this servant that
my father lost at a card game?

282
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,911
Apparently he is the culprit.

283
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:54,000
He even tried to start a fire and got caught,
his pockets full of stolen money.

284
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,963
Lise, have you arrived
already? Perfect. A miracle, isn't it?

285
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:01,924
A godsend, if God exists.

286
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:05,011
I just saw your
fiancé. What's his name?

287
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:06,470
You knew!

288
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:07,912
Still as a statue...

289
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:10,433
You knew! You knew!

290
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,540
It was... I could have...

291
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:39,879
stayed with you... at the
price... of their lives...

292
00:30:40,254 --> 00:30:45,217
What if all of this was so that we
can get married, and start a new life,

293
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,640
clean and proper?

294
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,518
All you want is to
imprison me. With you.

295
00:30:54,685 --> 00:31:00,691
And show me that there is a
huge spider inside the wardrobe...

296
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,947
And we will spend
the rest of our lives,

297
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:08,781
staring at it, terrified,

298
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:13,871
and this spider would
be... it would be...

299
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,843
No, no! I don't want you to
snivel. I don't want you to faint.

300
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,473
The Virgin, the Innocent! Enough!

301
00:31:34,016 --> 00:31:37,603
You gave yourself to me,
you loved me, you understood...

302
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,854
You know the truth.

303
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:46,007
All you can do is vomit when
facing the horror, the crime.

304
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,078
Playing each scene separately
isn't enough.

305
00:31:55,538 --> 00:32:01,919
The weeping girl, the hysterical
girl, in love, the girl losing her charms...

306
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,966
I don't want you to play each scene,
I want you to act your part!

307
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,176
I've seen actors playing each scene amazingly,
like the branches of a tree.

308
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,389
"The tree-actors". At the end, all
you could hear was rustling of the leaves.

309
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,809
It's crap! What matters is
what's happening between the scenes,

310
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,936
the truthfulness of the character,

311
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,064
the heart of the role. The
perceptiveness of the role!

312
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,193
All that you carry within during
the movie, the destiny of the character.

313
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:33,242
I want you to know everything, I
want you to show me like X-rays would.

314
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:39,478
To find the truth, the
truth of what's right here!

315
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,292
Do you understand?

316
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,962
I don't understand what you
mean! I don't understand what you want!

317
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,339
Listen! If you think that
everything can be found in life, such as love,

318
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,469
lies, and cheating, then
you can't play your part.

319
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:55,848
Love isn't just physical, fear isn't
only being afraid of the big bad wolf!

320
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:59,602
Rebellion isn't just sticking
a needle in your veins!

321
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,980
Coming from the gutter doesn't mean you
have to act as if God doesn't exist!

322
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,423
I'm tired.

323
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:11,322
Fine, act the tiredness. At
least there'll be something there.

324
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,994
Let's try again. Enough! Let's go!

325
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,837
Action. Open up. Open up!

326
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,883
Pronounce each word.

327
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:34,261
You are growing
up, becoming an adult.

328
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,517
Go on... "all you want"...

329
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,436
"Is to imprison me here!"

330
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:47,024
"We will spend"
- "We will spend"...

331
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,819
Calm down... open up.

332
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:54,824
All you want is to
imprison me here with you...

333
00:33:56,242 --> 00:34:02,290
And show me that there is a huge
spider inside the wardrobe, as big as a man.

334
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:09,547
And we will spend the rest of our
lives, staring at it, terrified.

335
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:15,553
And this spider would
be... It would be..

336
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:21,976
Cut.

337
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,197
It's not just me.

338
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,411
It's not just my movie you're
destroying. You're destroying yourself too.

339
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:51,881
OK, I get it.
Let's shoot a sex scene.

340
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,425
Yes, but which one?

341
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,885
We need to shoot something at least!

342
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,261
"No kidding, baby!"

343
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,559
This lady has been an ass.

344
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,689
It should be easy.

345
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,115
Come on, hurry up! Don't
you see we're waiting for her?

346
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,159
Hurry up, come on!

347
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,288
Well miss, would
you be kind enough...

348
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,956
Go away!

349
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,085
To lie there first, as
I will be on top of you!

350
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,363
If you want, I can go
with you. I'm OK with that.

351
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,422
If only you knew
how much I hate you...

352
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,257
So many gifted, deserving,
experienced girls... and you!

353
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,426
She won't do it!

354
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,387
She won't even do this!

355
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:51,774
"All you want is to imprison me,
and show me that there is a huge spider

356
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:59,156
as big as a man. And we will spend
the rest of our lives, staring at it.

357
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:05,454
And this spider would
be... it would be..."

358
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,295
Lucas. The producer
wants to know what's going on.

359
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,381
You have to make a decision.

360
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,303
Go away! I'll call you.

361
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,517
Let's walk and talk.

362
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,728
You know, I could easily take my
scissors and cut your part out!

363
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,647
I suck! There are some things
I just can't play...

364
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:37,318
An actress can keep nothing for
herself! She can't have her secret garden!

365
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:41,115
The sheep, the wolf,
and the grandmother!

366
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,701
And you were mistaken
- I'm not an actress!

367
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,037
I'm never mistaken. I
never make mistakes.

368
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,706
I can make mistakes about everything,
apart from that!

369
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,334
If you could do better, you'd be...

370
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,044
A star!

371
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,896
Don't give up on me! Don't leave me!

372
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,749
Where is it in you? Where?

373
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,716
Get out, just leave!

374
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,719
Leave me alone!

375
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,057
I told you to only come
visit when I tell you to.

376
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,646
Get out! Go away!

377
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,529
Go away!

378
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,731
Mlis-ka Elena...

379
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,316
Fifteen...

380
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:04,675
<i>The corpse of a 30 year old woman
was discovered in the ourcq canal.</i>

381
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:14,435
<i>We are showing these
images, despite their brutality.</i>

382
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:24,654
<i>The woman was wearing gold
stilettos. She was not carrying ID</i>

383
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:33,871
<i>and was only wearing flesh-colored
tights and a beige T-shirt. She had auburn hair.</i>

384
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,083
<i>The police are asking that anyone-</i>

385
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,919
That's it! Keep playing!

386
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,131
If a Judas happened to be spying
on me, he would find it difficult!

387
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,928
Nicolas was appointed by the
central committee, which I also belong to.

388
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,599
I am leaving to visit the other group
as soon as you have started.

389
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,558
How?

390
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,435
By any means possible!

391
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,773
First of all, accelerate the destruction
of this rotten society.

392
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,277
Second of all, run as fast
as possible through the shit.

393
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:09,822
Third, create a fair
society, based on equality and love.

394
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,411
- It will leave some marks.
- Exactly!

395
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:18,374
Murder,
blackmail, extortion, bombs...

396
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,295
organized lies!

397
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:28,009
We need a list of all those that
will be killed immediately

398
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:32,511
for being beyond redemption, and
those that we will have a temporary use for.

399
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:37,268
I came here to talk to you about the horrible
living conditions for students.

400
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,060
Do you have a
pair of small scissors?

401
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,063
- Pardon?
- I forgot to clean my nails.

402
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,859
Miss! A new religion is being born!

403
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:50,531
An absolute religion,
because of its absence of God!

404
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:59,705
My thinking brought me to understand
that freedom for all

405
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,711
can only be obtained through
slavery for all.

406
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,632
Those that want unlimited freedom

407
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,969
will only receive
unlimited despotism in the end.

408
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,890
There is my conclusion:

409
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:20,519
One tenth of society will rule,

410
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:25,316
and nine tenths will obey.

411
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,152
That's my despair.

412
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,281
Your despair is yours
alone. It's subjective.

413
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,452
Stop it! Nicolas is waiting!

414
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,746
- Are you ready to take action?
- Yes!

415
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,876
Christian.

416
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,175
Your departure would be dangerous for
us, or yourself, at this moment.

417
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,849
You heard it, Christian. You
know... if you don't agree with us...

418
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,227
Where are you going? To the police?

419
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,565
Can you see that,
Nicolas? Can you see it?

420
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,527
Your friend, did you
say? There he is, Judas!

421
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,823
And who do you work for? Who's destiny
are you preparing us for?

422
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,284
Yours!

423
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,972
Are you OK?

424
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,019
You're always in the way.

425
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,772
Kesling hasn't made
any decision regarding you.

426
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,235
I've always been against the
idea. But I'm only the wallet.

427
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,239
I really don't
understand what they see in you.

428
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,123
I came to give this back to you.

429
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,085
That's not mine.
I'm not completely gay...

430
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,962
but give it time.

431
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,214
It belongs to the woman
you were kissing that night.

432
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:16,385
- Her I.D. is in there.
- Why are you carrying it?

433
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,429
Because...

434
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,725
Because she's dead.

435
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,562
- Excuse me?
- I saw it on TV.

436
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,897
She had on the same shoes.
They said she was murdered.

437
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:35,403
So with your Z-list intelligence, you
decided that I kill actresses in Paris.

438
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,638
Actress?

439
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,742
She was an actress, but
she doesn't act any more.

440
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,243
And since I used to live with her,
you'll excuse me if I kiss my ex-girlfriends

441
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,080
where I want, when I
want, and how I want.

442
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:48,501
Especially when they become annoying
and live with assholes, have no money left.

443
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,799
She can't be dead, because I
walked her home, back to the asshole...

444
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,635
so you couldn't have seen her on TV.

445
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,553
I'll go to the police!

446
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,473
You won't go
anywhere! Only where I tell you!

447
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:07,687
You're fired! I'll show you this
big success, this faggot.

448
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,107
You're made for each other!

449
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,901
Get out! Get out!

450
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,207
Would you tell this young
lady the whereabouts of your...

451
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,649
Where's Elena?

452
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,460
She went back to Czechoslovakia.

453
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,986
Are you sure?

454
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,172
I took her to the
airport for her 12:00 flight.

455
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,342
How could she fly
if I had her passport?

456
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,012
She lost it a few days ago.

457
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,473
The embassy replaced it. Why?

458
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,021
Nothing.

459
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,898
You can check with the airline.

460
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,944
Did you know her?

461
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,904
You're an actress too, aren't you?

462
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,513
Yes.

463
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,200
She was a wonderful actress.

464
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,996
I was in love with
her since I was sixteen.

465
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,040
She could play anything.

466
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,711
She had been in plenty of films in
our country, before we went to Germany.

467
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,714
And she made
plenty of films there...

468
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,633
She could have kept going...

469
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,761
and she would have been as
famous as she was in Prague.

470
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,388
If she hadn't met this loser...

471
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,600
This loser who... who...

472
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,854
That's enough!

473
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:37,068
Me... not make same
mistake. Me... poor Czech immigrant.

474
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,739
Even if me look so
French, it just be imitation.

475
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,453
I hope you are single, miss.

476
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,331
And an actress.

477
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,042
Let's drink to actresses.

478
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,212
To Elena!

479
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,422
Long live Elena!

480
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,179
Bottoms up, an old Czech tradition!

481
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,684
Enough, enough!

482
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,271
Indeed. I don't
even need to be here...

483
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,665
Happy now?

484
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,103
You don't have the right to
humiliate people like this.

485
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,440
Even if you're the most powerful,
most intelligent,

486
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,942
even if you're always right.

487
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,831
Go away.

488
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,834
Go away!

489
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:29,221
<i>His Grace, Archbishop Schlapas, had
a long talk with the Minister.</i>

490
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:36,395
<i>His Grace has always let known his
love and understanding of French culture.</i>

491
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,358
<i>As usual, His Grace Schlapas
refused to answer journalists' questions,</i>

492
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:46,989
<i>and to all of those concerning
his Elevation to Cardinal.</i>

493
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:52,578
<i>The Pope can name a prince to the Church
in the secret of his heart only,</i>

494
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,374
<i>in order to avoid any possible
retaliation from the Government,</i>

495
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,503
<i>after his visit to Paris
and his pilgrimage to Lourdes.</i>

496
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,131
They stole the passport.

497
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,971
Elena Mliska...

498
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,392
Elena Mliska, fifteen, fifteen...

499
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,431
Sorry, I knocked.

500
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,766
Is it Mr. Kesling? Again?

501
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,343
No...

502
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,614
I didn't believe you.

503
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,492
I know just what it's
like to beg for a role...

504
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:17,371
So when you say that your... I
mean, that she, left the next morning...

505
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,914
My wife!

506
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,374
Come sit next to me.

507
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,459
Come, come.

508
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,691
What have you done
these last two days?

509
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,193
Since yesterday, you mean?

510
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,029
No, no...

511
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,824
You left two days ago. Two days ago!

512
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:42,373
You know I get sick
every time you leave.

513
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,295
When you leave, I put on those
beautiful clothes you bought me.

514
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,713
You're crazy!

515
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,425
Take this pretty scarf, the
one you brought back on Friday.

516
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:57,388
Put it on. It really suits you, and
it looks like it's going to rain.

517
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,638
- Where's your bag?
- What bag?

518
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:02,518
Your bag and the coat you left at
the hotel, where you go to screw Kesling!

519
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,855
Did you get into a fight? Did
he not give you what you wanted?

520
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,441
The hotel where Kesling
brings his whores, or his actresses...

521
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:10,818
Same difference!

522
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,362
Please, please...

523
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,740
I don't want to play that!

524
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:25,875
Why not?

525
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:51,233
Is that you?

526
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:58,950
I'm back.

527
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,204
You made the right choice.

528
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:51,043
I'm sure you're hungry.

529
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,652
Yes.

530
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,556
The day you left Kesling for me,

531
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,933
it was like a miracle.

532
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,521
For me too.

533
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,046
Come again?

534
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,275
I said, where was it again?

535
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,611
In Munich, you idiot! Munich!

536
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,863
Yes, in Munich...

537
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,199
And do you remember why
our door is never closed?

538
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,451
Because the last time you
left and I went looking for you,

539
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,289
someone broke in and
stole all the money we had left.

540
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,887
Where did you get those shoes from?

541
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,765
How much were they?

542
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:50,144
Did you turn tricks for the
money? How much do you charge?

543
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,520
Couldn't you spend the money
to sort out this shithole?

544
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,149
- That's not how it is!
- Where did you spend the night then?

545
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,825
At the Salvation
Army. It was horrible.

546
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:08,412
Some girl was screaming. She was either
going cold turkey or having DT.

547
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,331
I was scared of catching lice.

548
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,459
This morning, I washed in the fountain,
like homeless people do!

549
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,170
Why did you leave? Why?

550
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,298
I wanted to be alone! Alone! Free!

551
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,841
I don't want to be
with the people I love!

552
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,220
I can't love, I can't! Don't
you understand that?

553
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:25,745
I can.

554
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,351
- Promise me.
- I promise.

555
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:37,233
It's OK.

556
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,403
It's OK...

557
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,865
Keep me with you.

558
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:49,894
OK...

559
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,485
It suits you.

560
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,820
It always has.

561
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,204
I'll go back to
working in the kitchen.

562
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:15,039
I'll be home late tonight.

563
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,209
Me too, I'm going to look for a job.

564
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,419
As usual?

565
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,737
No.

566
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:25,424
You're not going to see him tonight?

567
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,301
I promise.

568
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:42,733
"When he holds me against him..."

569
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:46,904
You look different.

570
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,638
Don't you like it?

571
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:51,200
Take off your shoes. You
look silly in those.

572
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,494
I thought I'd relate
to you more with them on.

573
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,496
Today, you'll be against the wall.

574
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,213
Bastard...

575
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,924
Gertrude!

576
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:55,909
Gertrude!

577
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,430
Shit...

578
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,112
Milan!

579
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,599
Are you home?

580
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:33,798
Milan!

581
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,805
You scared me!

582
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,571
Did you get home early?

583
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:02,368
I quit. I got offered a better job.

584
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:05,413
There's money on the bed, count it.

585
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,207
That's great...

586
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,168
I have money, too.

587
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,588
I bought food. That way we can...

588
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:16,048
You promised!

589
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:18,843
It's an honest job.

590
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:22,847
I work in the cloakroom in
a club in Montparnasse.

591
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,099
I get fantastic tips...

592
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:26,780
just from selling cigarettes...

593
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:28,185
Ah, yes...

594
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,607
And how did you get this job?

595
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:39,030
Through my actress friend...

596
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,408
She's unemployed too...

597
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,036
Because of her age...

598
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:47,496
And her accent...

599
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:51,083
That's not a job for you.

600
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:54,712
You're a star.

601
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:57,381
An actress.

602
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,092
A fantastic actress!

603
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,678
A very good one.

604
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:08,601
<i>You really think that all
actresses are whores, don't you? That's it?</i>

605
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:13,856
All women, all girls... they
all have this inside of them...

606
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:20,279
Why are you still here?

607
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:23,032
I told you a thousand times already.
I don't love you anymore.

608
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:28,079
I don't want to pay what I owe you because
you ruined your career for me.

609
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:31,082
Just take your money ...

610
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:35,670
and fuck off!

611
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:49,767
Please, please, please...

612
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,440
I love you.

613
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:22,735
"When he holds me against him...

614
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:26,364
When he speaks softly to me...

615
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:30,618
I see life in pink..."

616
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:14,805
<i>There was a new outburst of violence
in Lebanon. A car-bomb exploded in Beirut,</i>

617
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,433
<i>resulting in four
deaths and twenty injuries.</i>

618
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:25,358
<i>Struggle amongst the FCP for
the position of First Secretary.</i>

619
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:31,322
<i>Members seem to take a
more radical approach.</i>

620
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:35,368
<i>"our objective is this:</i>

621
01:06:35,952 --> 01:06:39,997
<i>What we want is revolution!"</i>

622
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:47,296
<i>No lead for the murder of the
Archbishop, shot several times at point-blank range.</i>

623
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:52,425
<i>This amateur film was
filmed by one of the guests</i>

624
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:57,515
<i>outside a party
organized for the Archbishop.</i>

625
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:07,191
<i>Politicians, religious figures,
artists and fellow Czech citizens were present.</i>

626
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:14,031
<i>The camera operator was close enough
to capture the exact moment of the murder.</i>

627
01:07:19,704 --> 01:07:28,587
<i>This footage makes it possible
to identify the murderer, who fled.</i>

628
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:34,552
<i>Watch carefully, we have studied
each frame and have enlarged the footage.</i>

629
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:43,519
<i>To the left, you can clearly see the
weapon and the murderer's hand.</i>

630
01:07:45,604 --> 01:07:46,939
<i>Here...</i>

631
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:51,235
<i>And here is the side of his face.</i>

632
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:58,242
<i>The Police hope that
these blurred images</i>

633
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:01,787
<i>will help the investigation.</i>

634
01:08:02,622 --> 01:08:11,256
<i>Some suggested that the group who took
over Lithuania in 1940 are responsible.</i>

635
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,675
<i>His Grace Schlapas was due to
return home the day after tomorrow.</i>

636
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:31,984
If only I had guessed that you
were hiding here with this genius.

637
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,814
- Where is he?
- He killed a priest.

638
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,007
He's crazy. Sick and crazy.

639
01:08:35,092 --> 01:08:36,572
I was there. Do you
know what he's done before?

640
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:38,698
He came to me and asked me to
give you this farewell letter.

641
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,950
- Are you going to the police?
- I don't fucking care.

642
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:43,828
He can kill all the priests, I don't care.
As long as he doesn't destroy you.

643
01:08:43,913 --> 01:08:45,329
Why do you care?

644
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:49,041
You're mine. I made you. I can take
you back or send you back whenever I want.

645
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,276
Loser!

646
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:53,547
He won't steal another one from me.

647
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,884
It's only in my film that you
refuse to do what you're told.

648
01:09:02,765 --> 01:09:06,018
Why did you dye your hair? For
that faggot? Why did you sleep with him?

649
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:07,228
Why did you sleep with his wife?

650
01:09:07,395 --> 01:09:09,313
She sleeps with
everyone, just like you.

651
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:11,732
Now listen.

652
01:09:13,985 --> 01:09:18,990
Denounce him or I will. If not, you
stay with me, and become my property.

653
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:22,827
Maybe, one day, I'll
give you another chance.

654
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:49,353
You'll never come back here.

655
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:50,920
What about the neighbors?

656
01:09:51,105 --> 01:09:52,732
The neighbors are dead.

657
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:55,693
All of them are dead.

658
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:05,643
Taxi!

659
01:10:15,671 --> 01:10:18,549
Why did you do that? It's horrible!

660
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:21,133
Is that you? Thanks for coming.

661
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:24,388
And your hair... it
suits you so much more!

662
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:27,391
This is my film!

663
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,228
This is my film!

664
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:33,814
Does this mean anything to you?

665
01:10:36,442 --> 01:10:41,072
He's right. The most beautiful
film was directed by a sick producer!

666
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:43,616
I won't mention its name.

667
01:10:56,587 --> 01:10:58,172
I just don't know anymore.

668
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:02,385
I knew he couldn't handle it. I knew
our arrangement would work out in the end.

669
01:11:02,677 --> 01:11:04,845
I finally understand why
you wanted Christian dead.

670
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:06,764
To make a film about
this group of idiots.

671
01:11:06,973 --> 01:11:11,894
You understand, you have to start
with the idiots and the greedy,

672
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:14,605
who bring everyone else,
the sheep, right behind them.

673
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:18,442
Later, the citizens
spy on each other.

674
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:26,575
Slaves have to be equal. I love
misery, alcoholism, fear, lies, and obedience!

675
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:32,164
Total servitude!
Happiness! All of them miserable!

676
01:11:32,415 --> 01:11:35,293
Kill all talent!

677
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:39,839
From time to time, let them rest for
a while. Let them have a little idol.

678
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:42,508
So that they can believe that
they are improving society!

679
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:44,844
- You're crazy.
- Crazy? On the contrary!

680
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:48,806
I'd even give half the world to the
Pope. I'd only need the International to agree.

681
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:52,310
Does that sound crazy to you? The Pope
in Eastern Europe, and you here!

682
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:57,690
Because you are beautiful! I love
beauty. We need a leader, and you're beautiful.

683
01:11:58,065 --> 01:12:01,319
You believe in
everything, except in yourself.

684
01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:06,490
Do you know why you married this worm that
we now need to destroy at all cost?

685
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:08,993
Because you're
beautiful. Despite everything.

686
01:12:09,285 --> 01:12:10,952
For the challenge...

687
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:12,187
Enough!

688
01:12:17,168 --> 01:12:22,089
I love beauty. His
beauty and his genius!

689
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:25,426
Your only problem
is your desire to live!

690
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:28,427
But I will clear the
path to your destiny,

691
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,973
and you will become a leader
according to my expectations.

692
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:33,100
A murderer, a liar...

693
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:35,728
A worm!

694
01:12:37,897 --> 01:12:40,149
Cut. Thank you.

695
01:12:41,776 --> 01:12:43,736
- How long is it?
- 1 minute 23.

696
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,991
It's too long. I
can't shoot another one.

697
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,457
I can't take it
anymore. There's no time left.

698
01:12:56,707 --> 01:12:57,857
Quiet!

699
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,737
I'd like to go home now.

700
01:13:28,406 --> 01:13:30,147
He can't go there, he doesn't
know where I live.

701
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,599
OK.

702
01:13:35,413 --> 01:13:37,957
Is it true that Elena
came to ask you for a part?

703
01:13:42,253 --> 01:13:44,380
She wanted me to help
her go back to her country.

704
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:48,884
She had severed all links. She was
living with a political expatriate.

705
01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,554
She was scared of retaliations.

706
01:13:54,098 --> 01:14:00,167
How can you help her go back there,
when you're a director here?

707
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:07,278
I won a prize at the Karlovy
Vary Festival in Czechoslovakia.

708
01:14:08,404 --> 01:14:10,573
I knew a member of the government.

709
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:14,184
Really...

710
01:15:27,984 --> 01:15:29,944
- How did you know?
- I followed you.

711
01:15:30,194 --> 01:15:31,529
To the studio. Everywhere.

712
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:33,823
What did you do?

713
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:39,453
I killed whoever they wanted me to kill
to keep my wife alive. That's the reason!

714
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,080
But... she's dead!

715
01:15:42,748 --> 01:15:44,917
She's... she's...

716
01:15:45,334 --> 01:15:47,295
She's here because you're here!

717
01:15:47,712 --> 01:15:51,132
But she's over there because they
were meant to bring her back home.

718
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,428
They promised me that we would
be reunited right after.

719
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,889
They were sure she wouldn't go
to the police... to protect me.

720
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:02,852
But you know...
there's not much time left,

721
01:16:03,185 --> 01:16:07,982
and when I went to the meeting
point, it was a trap.

722
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:09,775
But they didn't get me!

723
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,153
But why? Why all of this?

724
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:16,782
So that they can find me with a
letter, saying that I killed him for no reason!

725
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,668
But you can't
stay here, if Kesling...

726
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:29,378
This time, you can't deny it.

727
01:16:30,379 --> 01:16:32,923
I saw you two go to
the hotel together.

728
01:16:38,054 --> 01:16:40,848
You forgot I was his wife
before being yours.

729
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:52,026
You'll need money. You'll
take what you left me.

730
01:16:52,193 --> 01:16:53,343
I can get more.

731
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:58,115
I have the details of where they're
going to shoot. Call me.

732
01:17:43,244 --> 01:17:46,831
I can't,
sweetheart. See for yourself.

733
01:17:47,707 --> 01:17:50,835
And you don't ever tell me anything.

734
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:56,424
People ask if you're available, but
you come and go as you please.

735
01:17:58,509 --> 01:18:00,469
I didn't know miss
Ethel would be here today.

736
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:02,888
Do you want me to cancel Lisette?

737
01:18:03,431 --> 01:18:05,099
I'll pay.

738
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:08,352
That will be 600 francs.

739
01:18:08,644 --> 01:18:11,188
There you go. Everything's sorted.

740
01:18:27,496 --> 01:18:28,748
Well, go on, move.

741
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,501
Don't you have your camera?

742
01:18:33,336 --> 01:18:37,089
I don't need it. I paid
what you asked for, didn't I?

743
01:18:46,932 --> 01:18:48,225
Is this what you want?

744
01:19:50,413 --> 01:19:52,498
What took you so long? We've
been waiting for hours.

745
01:19:52,623 --> 01:19:54,207
Can we not leave you alone
for five minutes?

746
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,209
I walked.

747
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:56,627
Give me your key.

748
01:19:57,962 --> 01:20:00,256
I can't stand what
you did to your hair.

749
01:20:00,798 --> 01:20:02,633
You look like an old Jewish woman.

750
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:06,220
Go for your make-up. We'll
dye it back to normal.

751
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:07,972
Is that OK with you?

752
01:20:10,433 --> 01:20:11,934
Action!

753
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:38,336
That's it. Dig now!

754
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:46,510
I give you back the Press!

755
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:51,015
You can print whatever you want!

756
01:20:54,769 --> 01:20:56,687
My wife is back.

757
01:20:58,105 --> 01:20:59,523
She is pregnant.

758
01:21:03,778 --> 01:21:05,529
I have changed.

759
01:21:08,574 --> 01:21:10,660
I don't want to
write against my beliefs.

760
01:21:11,077 --> 01:21:15,039
<i>You forgave your wife for leaving
with another man and coming back pregnant?</i>

761
01:21:33,182 --> 01:21:35,476
- I believe in God.
- Bastard.

762
01:21:41,357 --> 01:21:43,484
One, two, three!

763
01:21:48,155 --> 01:21:49,071
I like it.

764
01:21:49,156 --> 01:21:50,783
One, two, three!

765
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:02,044
Catch her!

766
01:22:05,756 --> 01:22:07,508
Be quiet!

767
01:22:07,925 --> 01:22:09,218
Cut!

768
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:10,869
Is it the one?

769
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:14,164
The blood!

770
01:22:31,115 --> 01:22:34,827
I'm shooting a
commercial about death.

771
01:22:36,162 --> 01:22:40,124
If you don't put blood on the screen,
it will run more freely behind.

772
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,585
What do you think of Kesling's work?

773
01:22:43,002 --> 01:22:44,462
It's fucked up, don't you think?

774
01:22:45,171 --> 01:22:46,547
It's really theatrical.

775
01:22:46,964 --> 01:22:48,716
Someone for you on the phone.

776
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:01,312
Yes, I'll be there.

777
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:02,879
I'll be there.

778
01:24:01,038 --> 01:24:03,332
Get up! Come on, get up!

779
01:24:11,882 --> 01:24:13,301
Sorry, I can't.

780
01:24:15,386 --> 01:24:17,596
I'll show you karate!

781
01:24:19,223 --> 01:24:21,684
Milan, I'm hurting!

782
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,521
Why are you laughing?

783
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:28,232
Because I'm happy!

784
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:30,985
Because you're here.

785
01:24:33,154 --> 01:24:39,327
Milan, do you believe I'll always
be such a loser, a reject, a slut,

786
01:24:39,619 --> 01:24:42,828
just because I have to live
and accept? To be able to make it!

787
01:24:42,913 --> 01:24:45,458
It's not "Milan", it's "Mi-lann"...

788
01:24:58,054 --> 01:24:59,204
Run!

789
01:25:13,444 --> 01:25:15,863
They must have followed
me, I can't see you anymore!

790
01:25:16,113 --> 01:25:17,490
It's never going to end!

791
01:25:17,782 --> 01:25:18,932
Run!

792
01:25:47,061 --> 01:25:48,312
Who's that?

793
01:25:49,105 --> 01:25:50,255
Another lover?

794
01:25:50,564 --> 01:25:51,732
Where did you find this?

795
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:53,693
In a letter you
didn't bother to open.

796
01:25:54,902 --> 01:25:56,052
So?

797
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:11,317
You're different.

798
01:26:12,545 --> 01:26:14,588
Solomon? Put mom on the phone!

799
01:26:15,047 --> 01:26:16,465
Change a bit more...

800
01:26:17,883 --> 01:26:19,033
When?

801
01:26:21,512 --> 01:26:25,850
Why didn't you tell me? Why not?

802
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,260
I thought it'd be better.

803
01:27:06,307 --> 01:27:08,768
They loved each
other a lot, you know.

804
01:27:09,518 --> 01:27:11,312
They just didn't know...

805
01:27:13,105 --> 01:27:14,255
how.

806
01:27:43,427 --> 01:27:45,096
You're not going to faint, are you?

807
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:41,652
I was thinking about
giving you your role back,

808
01:28:42,069 --> 01:28:44,113
but with
everything that just happened,

809
01:28:44,822 --> 01:28:48,159
do you want me to drive you home?

810
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:38,209
You know, I'm so happy you're here.

811
01:29:38,542 --> 01:29:40,378
I'll give you great make-up today!

812
01:29:44,048 --> 01:29:45,383
Oh, I'm so stupid...

813
01:29:45,883 --> 01:29:47,218
That happens all the time...

814
01:29:58,854 --> 01:30:01,399
Hi! I'm glad you're here.

815
01:30:02,024 --> 01:30:03,484
Today's will be easy for us.

816
01:30:03,943 --> 01:30:05,987
We're playing corpses!

817
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:15,830
Kesling promised me that he'd
let me try for your part,

818
01:30:16,706 --> 01:30:19,709
and now, that's not happening. Why?

819
01:30:21,961 --> 01:30:23,111
I don't know.

820
01:30:28,092 --> 01:30:30,720
But why? Why?

821
01:30:33,639 --> 01:30:35,599
Leave me alone!

822
01:30:52,325 --> 01:30:56,579
Lise! Stay there, don't go!

823
01:30:59,749 --> 01:31:01,125
Out the way!

824
01:31:04,337 --> 01:31:05,630
Get out of my way!

825
01:31:20,061 --> 01:31:21,729
I love you!

826
01:31:54,804 --> 01:31:57,348
One, two, three!

827
01:31:58,265 --> 01:32:01,143
The smell of blood again!

828
01:32:07,191 --> 01:32:08,567
Lise!

829
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:16,951
I am the one who killed them!

830
01:32:17,868 --> 01:32:20,871
I... am... the one... killed...

831
01:32:25,668 --> 01:32:30,673
I am... the one...
who killed them...

832
01:32:38,347 --> 01:32:39,497
Go on!

833
01:32:48,649 --> 01:32:52,236
I am... the one...

834
01:32:53,904 --> 01:32:55,072
You whore!

835
01:32:56,782 --> 01:33:01,537
Do you like the
smell of blood? Do you?

836
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:03,080
Whore!

837
01:33:43,913 --> 01:33:45,122
Go away.

838
01:33:49,085 --> 01:33:53,547
After this film, I'd like
you to make more with me.

839
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,490
I believe that together...

840
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:57,760
You do everything backwards.

841
01:33:57,969 --> 01:34:01,013
In your films and in your life.

842
01:34:02,431 --> 01:34:03,581
Why?

843
01:34:10,523 --> 01:34:13,693
Do you know what
cinema is for me in the end?

844
01:34:14,318 --> 01:34:16,529
To preserve the image of our Dead.

845
01:34:17,196 --> 01:34:20,574
This is actually the only way we
have found to keep them alive.

846
01:34:21,284 --> 01:34:24,412
Marilyn's dead, Gabin, Jouvet...

847
01:34:24,745 --> 01:34:25,895
Vivien Leigh...

848
01:34:26,789 --> 01:34:28,165
Raimu...

849
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,085
And me.

850
01:34:55,192 --> 01:34:56,342
OK.

851
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:07,020
Are you hurt?

852
01:35:08,748 --> 01:35:09,898
No.

853
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:23,674
You have to turn yourself in, Milan.

854
01:37:25,301 --> 01:37:28,512
If I do that, I won't see you again.

855
01:37:29,555 --> 01:37:31,682
It's no longer just
between the police and me,

856
01:37:31,891 --> 01:37:35,686
it's now between me and what's
left of my conscience.

857
01:38:00,544 --> 01:38:02,546
We have to call an ambulance!

858
01:38:09,387 --> 01:38:11,555
Your family is poor.

859
01:38:11,764 --> 01:38:15,474
You're doing well at
University thanks to a government bursary,

860
01:38:15,559 --> 01:38:19,021
then one day, they
take it back and say,

861
01:38:19,563 --> 01:38:23,067
"You need it... come on..."

862
01:38:24,068 --> 01:38:26,862
"tell us about your friends
at university".

863
01:38:27,571 --> 01:38:30,324
Then you realize that those
people are no longer welcome some places.

864
01:38:30,533 --> 01:38:32,451
Some are sent to prison.

865
01:38:33,411 --> 01:38:37,456
Then you are given a passport to leave,
because everyone knows you're the snitch.

866
01:38:37,581 --> 01:38:40,376
They make you meet a woman...

867
01:38:42,545 --> 01:38:45,548
And then you forget everything else.

868
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,260
You did everything for me.

869
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:51,554
Until the end.

870
01:38:54,515 --> 01:38:55,850
Will you call me?

871
01:38:59,353 --> 01:39:00,503
Are you hurt?

872
01:39:06,068 --> 01:39:07,218
Are you?

873
01:39:27,131 --> 01:39:28,007
Attention...

874
01:39:28,299 --> 01:39:30,009
Here he comes...

875
01:39:35,556 --> 01:39:37,308
Lise, there you are!

876
01:39:37,725 --> 01:39:40,603
I saw your fiancé in the garden,

877
01:39:40,811 --> 01:39:44,649
still like a statue, staring
at your window.

878
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:48,319
It's not that he is like a statue, just
that he is staring at your windows.

879
01:39:48,736 --> 01:39:53,741
You understand the text, it's
got a wild beauty, and...

880
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:58,788
I just saw your fiancé
- what's his name?

881
01:40:00,247 --> 01:40:03,668
As if he was in a trance,
still like a statue in the garden,

882
01:40:04,085 --> 01:40:05,252
staring at your window.

883
01:40:05,378 --> 01:40:07,004
I mean, the windows.

884
01:40:07,588 --> 01:40:09,006
Isn't that strange?

885
01:40:10,925 --> 01:40:13,219
Did you know?

886
01:40:17,473 --> 01:40:20,267
It was at the price...

887
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:27,066
It was at the price of their
lives... that I could stay here...

888
01:40:29,652 --> 01:40:32,530
All you want is to imprison me,

889
01:40:32,822 --> 01:40:38,869
and show me that there is a huge
spider inside the wardrobe,

890
01:40:39,036 --> 01:40:45,251
as big as a man. And we will spend the
rest of our lives, staring at it,

891
01:40:46,502 --> 01:40:51,090
admiring it, knowing it...

892
01:40:51,549 --> 01:40:54,552
And this spider would be...

893
01:41:03,561 --> 01:41:05,229
God...

894
01:41:15,364 --> 01:41:16,514
Good.

895
01:41:32,923 --> 01:41:35,885
Ethel, can you try
to speak to Kesling?

896
01:41:36,093 --> 01:41:39,138
He fired the continuity girl for
drinking too much, but there's still one day left!

897
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:44,267
Have you seen Kesling? You were very
good. Yesterday's rushes were amazing.

898
01:41:44,352 --> 01:41:48,689
<i>- Could I have an advance? - Of
course, where's my check-book...</i>

899
01:41:48,981 --> 01:41:52,109
The studio director has it, he left
and the accountant has closed access.

900
01:41:52,318 --> 01:41:53,468
Can it wait until tomorrow?

901
01:41:55,071 --> 01:41:57,657
It's OK. I'll find another way.

902
01:41:57,823 --> 01:42:00,534
Being crazy isn't
cheap. Very well...

903
01:42:04,622 --> 01:42:05,373
Gertrude?

904
01:42:05,706 --> 01:42:07,375
There's nothing left for you here.

905
01:42:08,876 --> 01:42:10,026
He's dead.

906
01:42:11,212 --> 01:42:13,631
The most terrible thing...

907
01:42:15,174 --> 01:42:16,842
is that I'm relieved.

908
01:42:18,135 --> 01:42:19,387
Are you becoming part of my race?

909
01:42:19,845 --> 01:42:23,057
What? What race? Did
you use him from the start?

910
01:42:23,224 --> 01:42:24,374
Yes! Yes and no!

911
01:42:24,517 --> 01:42:27,728
Me! Me! I was meant
to be the kingpin,

912
01:42:28,104 --> 01:42:32,481
helping the ascension of a proletariat that
doesn't exist, like everything else.

913
01:42:32,566 --> 01:42:36,110
And it just seemed so natural, a director
who is lonely but in love...

914
01:42:36,195 --> 01:42:38,864
with the woman he made
fantastic films with.

915
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,866
And he finds her in
Paris with her loser.

916
01:42:40,992 --> 01:42:42,493
Did you follow them?

917
01:42:42,702 --> 01:42:46,998
No, I was merely there to remind Mr.
Mliska what was expected of him.

918
01:42:47,164 --> 01:42:49,959
To help him get where he was meant
to be, at the right time.

919
01:42:50,293 --> 01:42:54,630
And if he refused, I had to
help capture his wife, if need be...

920
01:42:55,006 --> 01:42:56,156
Did she know?

921
01:42:56,924 --> 01:42:58,134
She knew.

922
01:42:58,467 --> 01:43:00,511
She was fucked... but not dumb.

923
01:43:00,803 --> 01:43:02,428
She was trying to
convince you to leave Milan alone.

924
01:43:02,513 --> 01:43:06,142
Tomorrow is my last shooting day. I
won't have any right over you anymore.

925
01:43:06,309 --> 01:43:09,353
I made you. You'll be a star.

926
01:43:09,603 --> 01:43:11,103
I don't give a
fuck. I'm not interested.

927
01:43:11,188 --> 01:43:15,192
You're interested! You'll
make more and more films!

928
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:18,362
Cinema is like bubbles of
light in an ocean of shadows.

929
01:43:18,738 --> 01:43:21,699
One has to prepare
its destiny to keep going.

930
01:43:22,366 --> 01:43:25,661
There, our boat is sinking!

931
01:43:26,829 --> 01:43:28,497
And you can hear the
chariots coming!

932
01:43:28,706 --> 01:43:29,856
Ivan!

933
01:43:30,374 --> 01:43:31,524
No...

934
01:43:31,917 --> 01:43:34,003
It's just the garbage men.

935
01:43:36,005 --> 01:43:38,341
I'm not crying for Milan.

936
01:43:40,259 --> 01:43:41,552
I'm crying for you.

937
01:43:50,645 --> 01:43:52,396
I love you.

938
01:43:54,357 --> 01:43:55,507
Don't patronize me.

939
01:43:55,775 --> 01:43:58,444
If you had any idea how
little I care about you...

940
01:43:58,736 --> 01:44:00,196
To what extent...

941
01:44:03,491 --> 01:44:04,241
I don't know...

942
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:06,744
I'll do anything so
that one day you'll know it.

943
01:44:08,412 --> 01:44:09,562
Do it.

944
01:44:20,007 --> 01:44:23,427
And now the creature is
going to devour its creator...

945
01:44:26,263 --> 01:44:27,431
Isn't it?

946
01:44:33,229 --> 01:44:34,939
Do you think I could handle it?

947
01:44:36,315 --> 01:44:37,942
Are you going to go to the police?

948
01:44:38,442 --> 01:44:40,653
Yes. I have to.

949
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:43,281
I could stop you.

950
01:44:49,287 --> 01:44:50,437
Are you scared?

951
01:44:51,163 --> 01:44:53,541
If you are, you
don't understand anything.

952
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:55,668
I can't hurt you.

953
01:44:56,585 --> 01:44:58,004
You're my film.

954
01:44:59,005 --> 01:45:00,965
I'm asking you to finish it.

955
01:45:01,424 --> 01:45:02,758
Just one day...

956
01:45:04,635 --> 01:45:05,785
Tomorrow.

957
01:45:06,846 --> 01:45:08,055
Will you come?

958
01:45:08,973 --> 01:45:10,123
I will.

959
01:45:26,616 --> 01:45:27,766
Hello?

960
01:45:31,412 --> 01:45:32,955
It's over, dear.

961
01:45:33,664 --> 01:45:36,459
I never told you, but
I've got so much debt...

962
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:39,001
You can't come back.

963
01:45:39,086 --> 01:45:40,236
I won't.

964
01:45:41,297 --> 01:45:43,633
Let's not say
goodbye just like this.

965
01:45:44,091 --> 01:45:45,509
Have you seen my apartment upstairs?

966
01:45:46,052 --> 01:45:47,202
No.

967
01:45:48,137 --> 01:45:49,287
Come in.

968
01:45:51,098 --> 01:45:52,350
This is my daughter.

969
01:45:54,185 --> 01:45:56,145
Are you going to say Hi to the lady?

970
01:46:01,943 --> 01:46:02,610
Hello...

971
01:46:02,818 --> 01:46:06,197
I was never able to
leave her. And it has cost me.

972
01:46:07,448 --> 01:46:09,659
Now she'll go into an institution.

973
01:46:13,496 --> 01:46:16,666
I'll try to find a job not
too far away from her...

974
01:46:23,965 --> 01:46:27,466
<i>Spectacular car
accident this morning in Paris.</i>

975
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:30,680
<i>A car drove into a
pylon on the highway.</i>

976
01:46:30,888 --> 01:46:37,895
<i>It took firemen more than twenty
minutes to extract the body of the driver,</i>

977
01:46:38,062 --> 01:46:39,814
<i>who was killed instantly.</i>

978
01:46:40,106 --> 01:46:45,236
<i>This incident is bringing new light
on the investigation into the murder</i>

979
01:46:45,403 --> 01:46:49,699
<i>of His Grace Schlapas, which
took place a few days ago in Paris.</i>

980
01:46:50,324 --> 01:46:55,288
<i>The victim of the car accident
is a Czech dissident, Milan Mliska.</i>

981
01:46:55,913 --> 01:47:02,753
<i>A note was found on his body,
claiming that he was the Archbishop's murderer.</i>

982
01:47:03,587 --> 01:47:08,509
<i>This would make investigators
reconsider their previous theory of a conspiracy.</i>

983
01:47:08,718 --> 01:47:18,269
<i>The letter is leading them to
consider that Mliska had mental health issues.</i>

984
01:47:18,644 --> 01:47:24,108
<i>It appears that he was trying to
bring attention to prisoner conditions.</i>

985
01:47:43,794 --> 01:47:47,129
You were on the cover of P. Match, Jours
de France and Elle. Did Kesling tell you?

986
01:47:47,214 --> 01:47:49,382
- Ethel, can I have an interview?
- Later, sure.

987
01:47:49,467 --> 01:47:51,968
There's my competitor, who
wants to steal you from me.

988
01:47:52,053 --> 01:47:55,473
Pleased to meet you, I brought a
script. It would be nice if you would read it.

989
01:47:55,681 --> 01:47:56,891
- Thanks.
- Sure.

990
01:47:57,516 --> 01:48:01,270
Ethel, we've not had much time to
talk, but I'm working on my first film

991
01:48:01,479 --> 01:48:04,442
and I'd like - what I mean - it's going
to be completely different from this one.

992
01:48:08,152 --> 01:48:12,073
Look, we've all helped buy this for him. It's solid gold
- do you like it?

993
01:48:12,323 --> 01:48:12,780
I do.

994
01:48:12,865 --> 01:48:14,659
- Hey, have they paid you?
- No.

995
01:48:14,992 --> 01:48:17,411
Listen, I have an
idea. Sign the box!

996
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,372
You'll be everyone's favorite.

997
01:48:20,998 --> 01:48:22,375
Or a flash in the pan.

998
01:48:28,005 --> 01:48:29,632
What's wrong, Ethel?

999
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:37,056
It's just as if I was
suddenly all alone in this world...

1000
01:48:55,324 --> 01:48:59,578
"Modern and unexpected, the new revelation
of young French cinema".

1001
01:49:00,538 --> 01:49:03,874
"'I Have Met a Star'
by Lucas Kesling".

1002
01:49:05,334 --> 01:49:10,339
"Pros and Cons: Touching,
serious and unusual, the new beauty"...

1003
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:15,678
"Young woman: Actress or object?"

1004
01:49:15,886 --> 01:49:20,558
"All three, answers Lucas Kesling, the
flamboyant director of 'The Possessed"'.

1005
01:49:26,355 --> 01:49:28,316
"The Unusual Life"...

1006
01:49:57,553 --> 01:50:03,517
Forgive me, bless
me, love me, remember me...

1007
01:50:05,686 --> 01:50:07,647
Always go where life is...

1008
01:50:08,064 --> 01:50:11,776
Don't turn back, believe
in yourself.

1009
01:50:15,196 --> 01:50:17,740
You're the most beautiful
gift God could give a man.

1010
01:50:18,616 --> 01:50:21,911
A man would need to be...

1011
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:25,957
as proper...

1012
01:50:30,169 --> 01:50:33,547
and humble as you
are, to deserve you.

1013
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,670
Go!

1014
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:54,151
Then he walks past the
building, inside, two guys are arguing.

1015
01:50:54,318 --> 01:50:58,197
Those two guys were producers, and
he didn't even know that cinema exists...

1016
01:50:59,824 --> 01:51:05,162
And half an hour
later, these two guys ask him...

1017
01:51:07,498 --> 01:51:09,834
Oh my God, no!

1018
01:51:15,089 --> 01:51:17,049
Shit. He hung himself for real.

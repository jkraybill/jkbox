1
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,204
BICYCLE THIEVES

2
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,773
Ricci?

3
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,902
Is Ricci here?

4
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:11,297
They called you.
Are you deaf? Come on!

5
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:27,146
So us bricklayers
should just starve?

6
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,441
There's nothing I can do.

7
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,653
Be patient.
We'll try to help everyone.

8
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:37,865
That's what I'm here for.
We'll see what we can do.

9
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,159
Ricci, there's a job for you.
- A job?

10
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,828
You'll be putting up posters.

11
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,997
Go to their office.

12
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,250
Take this letter
and your work permit.

13
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,295
- There's nothing for us?
- I'll be damned!

14
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,880
What about us?

15
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,092
I've just got jobs
for lathe operators.

16
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,552
So I should just rot?

17
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,055
What can I do?

18
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,808
Ricci, don't forget
to take your bicycle.

19
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,603
You need one.
It's says so on the slip, right?

20
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,438
My bicycle?

21
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:12,650
I have one...
but not at the moment.

22
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,571
I'll have it in a couple days.
- You need one now.

23
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,158
What's it matter?
I'll go on foot for a few days.

24
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:25,538
Listen, you got one or not?
If not, someone else gets the job.

25
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:30,543
- I have one!
- You're not the only one. I do too.

26
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,546
You're a bricklayer.
That's a different category.

27
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,090
- Then change it!
- I can't!

28
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,592
You have a bicycle or not?

29
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:41,387
Yes.
I'll report for work this morning.

30
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,890
No joking around.
If you don't have a bike, forget it.

31
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:49,061
And wait around here forever?
I'll get the bike.

32
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,896
- Cataldi!
- Here!

33
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:55,860
- Manual labor for two days.
- I'll take it.

34
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:58,696
Listen, I can't make up jobs!

35
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,711
Maria!

36
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:27,141
- What is it?
- Do I have rotten luck or what?

37
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,227
There's a job,
but I can't take it!

38
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:33,689
A job?
I don't understand.

39
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,275
What did you say?
Stop, Antonio.

40
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,986
What did you say?
A job?

41
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,614
And a good city job too!

42
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:50,831
It'll be all right.
Can't you work things out?

43
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:55,836
What's to work out?
I need my bicycle right now.

44
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,005
I have to start right away

45
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,799
or I lose the job.

46
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,802
- What can we do?
- Nothing.

47
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:10,726
- You should never have pawned it!
- What would you have eaten?

48
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,646
I curse the day I was born!
- Quiet.

49
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,148
I feel like jumping in the river!
- Quiet!

50
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,662
Get up.

51
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,592
- What are you doing?
- We can sleep without sheets.

52
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,235
There are six sheets there.

53
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,362
Linen and cotton.

54
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:49,366
Good stuff. From my dowry.
- They're used.

55
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:52,453
Not all of them.
Two are new.

56
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,121
How many pieces?

57
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,832
Six.
Three doubles, three singles.

58
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,584
That's three.

59
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,631
7,000 lira.

60
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,760
Couldn't you make it a bit more?

61
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,012
They're used.

62
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,349
All right.
Put these in here.

63
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:16,226
7,500.

64
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,648
Name?
- Maria Ricci.

65
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:25,152
Valmelaina.
Block H, Apartment 1.

66
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,221
It's a bicycle.

67
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,813
- 6,100.
- Why?

68
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:04,608
- Interest. It's the 31st.
- Here.

69
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,368
It's the Fides.
Next to that red one.

70
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,120
I know, I know.

71
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,905
Wait a second.

72
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,010
Where's the man in charge?

73
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,720
Over there.

74
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:18,015
Put that down.
What are you afraid of?

75
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:23,687
Put that bike down.

76
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,481
Sorry.

77
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:29,735
My name is Antonio Ricci.

78
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,281
The employment office
in Valmelaina sent me.

79
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,416
You start in the morning.

80
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,377
The storeroom will give you
what you need.

81
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,932
- Tomorrow at 6:45.
- I'll be there.

82
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,935
- How did it go?
- Good.

83
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,395
Sorry you had to wait,
but it's all set.

84
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:08,482
- What's this?
- There's a job for you too.

85
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,320
You have to tighten
the strap on my cap. It's loose.

86
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,950
Come look.

87
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,122
Everyone has his own locker.

88
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,457
See how big it is?

89
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,303
Just think: They used
to even provide shoes.

90
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,973
But the pay's still good.

91
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,434
6,000 bimonthly,
plus a family allowance.

92
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:47,062
And then there's overtime!

93
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,152
Can we stop
at Via della Paglia?

94
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,405
- What for?
- I have to see a woman.

95
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,824
- A woman?
- Yes, a woman.

96
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,586
Stop here a minute.

97
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,172
Who lives here?

98
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:16,133
I told you -- a woman.
I'll just be a minute.

99
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,051
I'll be right back.

100
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,698
<i>- Is it mine?</i>
- No, it's mine.

101
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,914
That makes it five to three.

102
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,961
Concierge.

103
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,802
Excuse me.
Does the Holy One live here?

104
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:04,223
- The Holy One?
- The one who sees.

105
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,934
I don't know.

106
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,728
Let's try the second floor.

107
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,739
- Is the Holy One here?
<i>- Yes, the last door.</i>

108
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,675
Hey, kid, could you watch
the bike for a minute?

109
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,604
Last door.

110
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,649
<i>February, March, and April
have come and gone.</i>

111
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,318
<i>- How long has he been in bed?
- Over a year.</i>

112
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:04,491
<i>- You could have brought him.
- How? He can't move.</i>

113
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:07,577
<i>This one yes, that one no.</i>

114
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,332
Dear God, grant me your light.

115
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:16,545
Your son will rise from his bed
before the leaves fall.

116
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,006
Before the leaves fall?

117
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,549
Maria.

118
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,801
Come on.

119
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,849
Maria, let's go.

120
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,145
Come on.

121
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:37,816
What are you doing here?
- I owe her 50 lira.

122
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,860
Come on.
Don't be stupid.

123
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,655
She said you'd find a job.
I want to do my part.

124
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,576
- I'll come in and tell her what I think.
- All right, all right.

125
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,580
How can a woman with two children
and a head on her shoulders

126
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,334
listen to all this stupid nonsense?

127
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,252
I don't get it.

128
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,755
What are you doing now?

129
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,424
You must have money
to throw away.

130
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,428
I don't know what got into you.

131
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:09,264
Women!
Couldn't you spend it better?

132
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,433
I'm just grateful.

133
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,186
You think she got me the job?

134
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,022
Come on. Get on.

135
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,233
Let's go home, dummy.

136
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,204
Hurry, Bruno. It's 6:30.

137
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,916
It's too dark in here
to clean it good.

138
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,598
- Daddy, look what they did.
- What?

139
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,101
- There's a dent.
- Maybe it was there.

140
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,645
No, they did it.

141
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,148
Who knows how they store them.
I'd have said something.

142
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,401
They don't pay for the repairs!

143
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,070
- Keep your voice down.
- All right.

144
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,197
But I'd have said something.

145
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,579
Is that cap ready?

146
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,585
- What did you make?
- Egg sandwiches.

147
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,758
Let me see. Wow!

148
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,803
- Handsome?
- You look like a cop!

149
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:34,099
Stop it!
You're hurting me!

150
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,311
Will you behave?
You'll wake the baby!

151
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,822
Here, Bruno.
An egg sandwich.

152
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,137
Let's go.

153
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,530
Bye, Mama.

154
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:15,617
See you tonight at 7:00.
Wait for me here.

155
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,712
Good morning.

156
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:09,546
First, you give it
a coat of glue.

157
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,344
Then you put up the poster.

158
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:22,517
Then another
light coat of glue,

159
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:26,396
flattening out the poster
and smoothing out the lumps.

160
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,897
Got that?

161
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:29,232
Beat it, kid!

162
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,277
If you leave any lumps,

163
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,489
the inspector will fine you.

164
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,661
You gotta be smart
to do this job.

165
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:44,456
You need a good eye
and a quick hand.

166
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,334
There.

167
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,002
Let's go.

168
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:00,263
- See you, Ricci.
- Thanks.

169
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,864
Thief! Thief!

170
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,200
What happened?

171
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,088
Hop on!

172
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,299
After him, quick!

173
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,304
I saw him head for the tunnel!

174
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,559
Faster!

175
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,739
What's going on?

176
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:44,993
Well?

177
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,079
I was sure he came this way.

178
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:50,915
Yeah, sure he did.

179
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:18,461
Yes, there were people around,
but I had to go after him.

180
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,129
<i>Falloni!</i>

181
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,765
- What is it?
- Go to the meeting.

182
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,392
Capece's going.

183
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,437
Change in plans.
You and Quadrone are going.

184
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,614
Sign this.

185
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:48,867
Quadrone!
We're going to the meeting.

186
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,785
Hurry up there!

187
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,126
- Can you do something?
- Look yourself if you have time.

188
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,086
Look all over Rome?

189
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,047
Well, I sure wouldn't recognize it.

190
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,342
I gave you the serial number
and a description.

191
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:10,388
Sure. It'd take the whole
mobile unit to look for it.

192
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,224
Then why even file a complaint?

193
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,145
Suppose you find it
tomorrow in a bike shop.

194
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,898
Call a policeman.
It's on file.

195
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,318
- Anything serious, Captain?
- Just a bicycle.

196
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,947
- Then it's up to me?
- I've already told you.

197
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:31,534
You filed your complaint.
Now good night.

198
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,769
Don't try cutting in line!

199
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,984
Excuse me,
but I was here first.

200
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:36,724
Bruno.

201
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,518
Daddy, it's 7:30.

202
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,270
I took the bus. Let's go.

203
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,985
Where's the bike?

204
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,013
- Did it break down?
- Yeah, it broke down.

205
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,413
You go inside.
I'll be back later.

206
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,540
Go on.

207
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,060
<i>It's not about
the employment office.</i>

208
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,146
<i>Without work,
people can't be placed in jobs.</i>

209
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:10,276
<i>We've raised this issue
with the Department of Labor.</i>

210
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,612
<i>A welfare check solves nothing.</i>

211
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:17,575
<i>It just humiliates the worker
and doesn't help anything.</i>

212
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,369
<i>We need a massive program
of public works.</i>

213
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,580
But what did they say
at today's meeting?

214
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:27,085
Same as always:
"You can't expect miracles."

215
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,046
- Is Baiocco here?
- Quiet back there.

216
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,090
It was him!

217
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,634
"You can be sure

218
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,261
we'll do our best
to find you jobs."

219
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,620
Ricci, I'm stealing your job.

220
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,237
I'll be right back.

221
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,742
- What are you doing here?
- I've got to talk to you.

222
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,662
- What is it?
- They stole my bicycle.

223
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,373
Son of a bitch! Where?

224
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:50,793
At the Florida.
I was putting up posters.

225
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,670
How'd it happen?

226
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,672
You've got to help me.

227
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,759
I have to find that bike.

228
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,680
Easier said than done.

229
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,184
Excuse me. Baiocco, listen,
or we'll be here all night.

230
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,935
I'm listening.

231
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:13,316
<i>If you really cared for me</i>

232
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,817
Quiet, everyone!

233
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:17,236
<i>You wouldn't let people tease me</i>

234
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:18,863
I heard you.

235
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,992
You think I'm stupid?

236
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,369
Keep rehearsing.
I'll be right there.

237
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:37,548
Piazza Vittorio's your only hope,
and you gotta act quick.

238
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:42,220
They unload the stuff right away.
You just have to look there.

239
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:47,516
Antonio.

240
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:53,022
- Is it true?
- Don't start whining.

241
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,399
I purposely didn't go home
to avoid that.

242
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:58,110
Who's whining?

243
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:02,698
But this doesn't happen every day.
Have you done anything?

244
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:04,784
Have you looked for it?

245
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,788
Don't cry.
You look like a little girl.

246
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:10,831
We'll find it.

247
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,628
They'll swap some parts,
but it'll be on the market tomorrow.

248
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,590
And if it is,
we'll take it home, right?

249
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:24,262
You might not sleep so well tonight,
but we'll find it.

250
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:26,097
Don't worry.

251
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:30,726
Miss, would you care
to take a stroll with me?

252
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:32,770
No, I'm with my mother.

253
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,610
No! This is either
a rehearsal or a meeting.

254
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,280
You tell 'em, Meniconi.
- He's right.

255
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:51,163
Go home now.
We'll see what we can do.

256
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,082
- Until tomorrow then.
- Good night.

257
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:56,127
Remember what I said.
Good night.

258
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:11,786
Give her a little gas
or we'll never get out of here.

259
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,832
Get that cart out of the way.

260
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:19,710
Baiocco, we're here.

261
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:22,922
Meniconi and Bagonghi,
come here.

262
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,257
What make was it?

263
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,635
A lightweight Fides,
1935 model.

264
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,054
He knows it better than me.

265
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,891
Good. That means we can split up.
They always take them apart.

266
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,435
Bagonghi, let's go this way.

267
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,938
No, this way is better.

268
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,566
You two look
at nothing but tires.

269
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,568
You look at frames.

270
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:47,863
Bruno, pumps and bells.
Let's go.

271
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,907
- It's a Fides frame.
- Got it.

272
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,329
We'll look for it piece by piece

273
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:58,916
and then put it back together.

274
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,754
Bagonghi,
keep your eyes open.

275
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,342
There's only vegetables here.
We're not looking for that.

276
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:12,763
We'll stroll
through the stands over there,

277
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,641
not letting on what we're doing.

278
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:18,060
Indifferent to everything.

279
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,022
They're setting up now.

280
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,451
- Just look at this!
- He'll find it, I'm sure!

281
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,245
This really gets my goat!

282
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:45,171
Remember, Bruno:
pumps and bells.

283
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:48,716
If you see anything, whistle.

284
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,552
You know what to do.
You come with me.

285
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:56,974
Bruno, if we find it,
we'll celebrate.

286
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,522
Put that down.

287
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:13,574
Beat it, kid.

288
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,837
Keep your eyes peeled
for a Fides.

289
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,858
Looking to buy, dummy?

290
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:06,418
- Let me work, or I'll give you this!
- Just try it!

291
00:34:06,585 --> 00:34:10,214
You cranky this morning or what?

292
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,009
I'm in no mood for this.
Beat it.

293
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,720
I was here first.

294
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:18,764
You wanna fight?

295
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:22,685
We can't all stick together.

296
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,229
Antonio, you look for the tires.

297
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,399
Bagonghi, the frame.
The kid'll look for the pump.

298
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,859
I'll look around on my own.

299
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,439
Take a look at this frame.

300
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,952
Yeah?

301
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,705
- What make is that?
- You buying?

302
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,291
Hands off.
The paint's still wet.

303
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,460
I have to see
the serial number.

304
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:15,339
Why?
You buyin' serial numbers?

305
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,884
No, he's not.
Now just show him.

306
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,887
- And if I don't?
- Then I'll call a cop.

307
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,972
Go ahead!

308
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,646
You think it was stolen?

309
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,692
Who said anything?
But you have to show the number.

310
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,444
Do I ask to see
your shoe size? No!

311
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:39,613
And I don't show you
my frame numbers!

312
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,949
You play the lottery with it?

313
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,617
No, I don't.

314
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,869
Wouldn't you like a bell?

315
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:48,622
You've been here looking
for half an hour.

316
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,042
Shall I buy you this one?

317
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:56,588
How much is a bell?
- A hundred fifty lira.

318
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,716
Would you like it?

319
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:00,551
Just listen.

320
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,262
You filed your complaint.
You're covered.

321
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,598
Show him that frame.

322
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,352
Go ahead and look.
A man can't even work in peace.

323
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,523
Don't you trust me either?

324
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:20,988
12024.

325
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,906
Is it yours?

326
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,660
You got paint on you.

327
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,455
It's not a matter of trust.

328
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:32,374
A man who's been robbed
has a right to look.

329
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,251
Who's stopping you?

330
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,546
We all make mistakes.

331
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,478
Hey, buddy...

332
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,647
we're all honest here
in Piazza Vittorio!

333
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,111
Forget about him.

334
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:04,615
Just look for a Fides.
- What do you think I'm doing?

335
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,036
- Where's my son?
- He must be over by the carts.

336
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:13,248
- There's nothing more for us here.
- It's tough.

337
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,877
How about something else?

338
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,296
Stay with me.

339
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,465
Come on.

340
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,348
Antonio,
go with him to Porta Portese.

341
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,767
We'll keep looking here.

342
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,103
Our chances are better here.
It's too late for Porta Portese.

343
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,439
Go on now.

344
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,484
Go with him.

345
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:43,320
Careful.

346
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,147
You just can't win.

347
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,359
It rains every Sunday.

348
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:28,115
Sundays I'm off at 1:00,
and where can you go?

349
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:33,078
Movies bore me.
I just don't like 'em.

350
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:36,582
Look at this guy!
I ought to run him over!

351
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,293
Stupid jerk!

352
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:43,046
They jump out in front of you
and you end up in jail

353
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:45,883
before you even know
what's happened!

354
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,178
Look at this rain.

355
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:53,557
You just can't win.
It rains every Sunday.

356
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:40,998
What happened?

357
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,125
I fell down!

358
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,377
Wipe yourself off.

359
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:10,193
- You afraid of rain?
- Don't want to get my tux wet!

360
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:28,814
- A hundred lira?
- You're lucky to get that.

361
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,191
What can I do with this?

362
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,661
Stop him!

363
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,590
Stop him! Thief!

364
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:08,979
Bruno, let's find that old man!

365
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,992
There he is, Daddy!

366
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,772
Damn it!
Where did he go?

367
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,374
Bruno, where are you going?

368
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,609
Bruno!

369
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,653
What are you doing?
Come on!

370
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,294
Excuse me.
I want to ask you something.

371
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:59,965
That young man who was with you --
where can I find him?

372
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,174
What young man?

373
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:03,885
He talked to you
and then rode off on a bike.

374
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,472
- Why? What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

375
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:09,891
It's an urgent private matter.

376
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:13,311
What can I tell you?
I don't know him.

377
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,772
You were together
under the arches!

378
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:19,109
There are lots of young men
under the arches.

379
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:24,406
Wait a second.
I have to talk to him.

380
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,950
Let me go!
Leave me alone, kid.

381
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,829
I'm just an old man
who minds his own business,

382
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:34,040
and what do I get? Trouble.

383
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:57,605
It's late! You're supposed
to be here by 10:00.

384
00:46:57,772 --> 00:47:01,818
- They said you were always open.
- Go on now.

385
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,004
- What about lunch?
- Later. You need a mess kit.

386
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:26,259
First-timers, take your mess kits
out into the courtyard.

387
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,178
Go ahead now.

388
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,430
There's no time to lose.

389
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:39,022
Line them up neatly,
not like last time.

390
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,400
Each of you will come pick up

391
00:47:42,525 --> 00:47:44,694
your own mess kit later.

392
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,449
Maybe I should get a shave.

393
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:53,870
You need a shave?
Then come inside.

394
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,289
Sit down.

395
00:48:02,295 --> 00:48:03,755
Go inside.

396
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:07,967
Will you be much longer, Counselor?
- No, just these two.

397
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:09,386
No, not me.

398
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,805
Then we can begin?

399
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,396
Don't shave my chin.

400
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:22,649
I'm letting it grow there.

401
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,026
Hurry, the priest's waiting.

402
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:27,028
That's enough now, Counselor.

403
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:29,114
You need another barber.

404
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,282
Come with me, little boy.

405
00:49:28,506 --> 00:49:30,341
Move over, would you?

406
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:53,740
I have to find that young man.
It's a personal matter.

407
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,825
I have to talk to him.

408
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,289
Will you tell me
where I can find him?

409
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,583
Just leave me alone.

410
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,002
I don't know
what you're talking about.

411
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,382
Page six.

412
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,181
"May I leave this holy place...

413
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,147
with my soul purified..."

414
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,029
There's money in it for him.

415
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:34,781
Where is he?

416
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,533
I don't have to say.

417
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,118
You do too, or I'll get the police.

418
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,871
What have I done to you?
Leave me alone.

419
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,041
Lay off.

420
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,794
"Though I may travel once more

421
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,172
the path of sorrow
and hardship..."

422
00:50:51,464 --> 00:50:53,883
Just tell me where he is.

423
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:55,760
What can you lose?

424
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,887
I've got nothing against you.

425
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:01,307
In fact, I'm prepared to pay.

426
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,728
- What's for lunch?
- Pasta and potatoes.

427
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,234
Will you tell me?

428
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,489
Jail is worse, you know.
You'll rot there.

429
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,868
Where is he?
- All right. Via della Campanella.

430
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,372
What number?

431
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,749
Ah, for chrissake!

432
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:29,586
I think it's No. 15.

433
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:35,258
- You're coming with me.
- Go by yourself.

434
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,511
No! You come with me
or I call the police!

435
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:41,681
I'm tired of begging you!
You got that?

436
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,851
Quiet, or I'll have you thrown out!

437
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:57,196
Are you coming?

438
00:51:57,322 --> 00:52:00,533
I'm not going anywhere.

439
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,411
- What have you got to lose?
- Go away!

440
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,581
- I'm losing my patience.
- Lose whatever you like.

441
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:10,126
Goddamn it! Come along
or I'm going to the police.

442
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,129
Do whatever the hell you like.

443
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,674
You're coming with me,
you hear?

444
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:22,472
Leave me alone
or you'll be sorry.

445
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:24,807
Come on, let's go!

446
00:52:24,932 --> 00:52:27,685
I'm not going anywhere.

447
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,897
- I'll show you. Come on!
- Leave me alone!

448
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:39,489
At least let me get
my lunch first.

449
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,658
I'm going with you.

450
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:43,910
Just when I can get
a decent meal!

451
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:47,330
Stop them.

452
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,291
- Where are you going?
- To get this man's lunch.

453
00:53:12,855 --> 00:53:14,816
Did a man come this way?

454
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,110
No, and we're not ready yet.

455
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,862
Girls, more over here.

456
00:53:19,987 --> 00:53:22,865
Not so much there.

457
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,287
Just what do you want?

458
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,958
- I want to get out!
- It's locked, and the lawyer has the key!

459
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,669
Stop making such a racket!

460
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,462
You're in church!

461
00:53:41,592 --> 00:53:43,511
Will you please just leave?

462
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:49,142
This is no way to behave in church!
Come with me!

463
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,064
Stop!

464
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,692
I have to find him.
I know he's here.

465
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,080
Did you come to hear mass
or make trouble?

466
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,750
Just what do you want?

467
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:17,754
I told you:
I'm looking for an old man!

468
00:54:25,928 --> 00:54:27,930
I've got to find him!

469
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,643
Where do you think you're going?

470
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,687
He came this way!

471
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,113
- Who knows where he's gone now.
- That's enough!

472
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,706
He didn't just fly away.

473
00:54:57,084 --> 00:54:59,670
Why'd you let him go
for his lunch?

474
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,923
Would you shut up!

475
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,431
Where are you going?
Come back here.

476
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,475
Come on!

477
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,187
You coming or not?
- No!

478
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,315
Let's go!

479
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,609
Some kid I have!
Come on!

480
00:55:21,734 --> 00:55:24,821
- Why did you hit me?
- You asked for it.

481
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:28,324
Let's go.
- No. You go alone.

482
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:30,451
Will you come on?

483
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,958
Little troublemaker.

484
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,381
You're a little nag.
- I'm gonna tell Mama.

485
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:46,008
We'll settle this at home.

486
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,266
Wait for me by the bridge,
you hear?

487
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,021
I'm gonna look for the old man.

488
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:29,218
<i>Help! A boy's drowning!</i>

489
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:47,046
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

490
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,904
Bruno, put on your jacket.

491
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:13,823
You'll catch a chill.

492
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,574
Go ahead.

493
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:19,912
Come on.

494
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,834
Put it on.

495
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,056
You tired?

496
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,476
Sit down a minute.

497
00:58:42,601 --> 00:58:45,521
Not much we can do now
but go home.

498
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,398
Sit down.

499
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,366
Go, Modena!

500
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,539
Is Modena a good team?

501
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,212
You hungry?

502
00:59:21,932 --> 00:59:23,726
How about a pizza?

503
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,568
Let's go.

504
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,987
Why kill myself worrying

505
00:59:35,112 --> 00:59:37,740
when I'll end up
just as dead anyway?

506
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,867
Come on.

507
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,595
Sit down.

508
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:06,185
Let's forget everything
and get drunk!

509
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:08,938
Waiter.

510
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,108
Arrigo, help this gentleman.

511
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,320
A half bottle?

512
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,490
- A full bottle and a pizza.
- We don't serve pizza.

513
01:00:19,615 --> 01:00:22,368
- You don't?
- This isn't a pizzeria.

514
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,495
- We want to eat.
- Eat?

515
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,123
- Yeah, eat!
- What do you want?

516
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,795
You want a mozzarella sandwich?

517
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:36,173
Two mozzarella sandwiches
and a full bottle.

518
01:00:37,049 --> 01:00:40,719
There'll be dessert later too.
How about that?

519
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:12,459
What's the matter? Drink.

520
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:18,007
If your mother saw me
giving you wine!

521
01:01:21,218 --> 01:01:23,262
But we can do as we like.

522
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:30,019
<i>You can explain it this way</i>

523
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,938
<i>Or explain it that way</i>

524
01:01:33,105 --> 01:01:36,692
<i>Call him Ciccio or Antonio
Beppe or Ciro</i>

525
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,863
<i>He's still a little black child
How could that have happened</i>

526
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,214
Let's just eat and enjoy.

527
01:02:06,513 --> 01:02:08,641
There's a cure for everything...

528
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,727
except death.

529
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,728
To eat like them,

530
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:58,065
you'd have to earn
a million lira a month.

531
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:05,614
Eat, eat. Don't worry.

532
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,742
You like it?

533
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,052
Things were going great.

534
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,931
With overtime, I figured --

535
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:34,226
I'll show you.

536
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,820
12,000 a month salary.

537
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,241
Here, you write it down.

538
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,705
12,000 salary...

539
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:59,293
plus 2,000 overtime...

540
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,796
plus the family allowance.

541
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:06,175
Altogether, 800 a day.

542
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,637
Thirty times 800 -- just imagine.

543
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,891
What more could you ask?

544
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:18,062
And I should just kiss it good-bye?
Well, I won't.

545
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:22,232
See now why we have to find it?
Otherwise we don't eat.

546
01:04:22,524 --> 01:04:24,026
What can we do?

547
01:04:24,526 --> 01:04:27,613
We'll go to the Porta Portese
every day.

548
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,866
We'll find those guys there.

549
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:32,326
Yeah, sure.

550
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,746
Those guys are long gone.

551
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,750
We'd never find them
with all your mother's candles

552
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,711
or all the saints in the world.

553
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:54,431
<i>Sports news:
Just like every Sunday,</i>

554
01:04:54,556 --> 01:04:56,892
<i>soccer teams throughout Italy</i>

555
01:04:57,017 --> 01:04:59,728
<i>will play
their scheduled matches today.</i>

556
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:04,358
<i>Of course, fans are excited
about the championship series.</i>

557
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,819
<i>Teams scheduled
to play today...</i>

558
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:16,370
Last door.

559
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:23,961
<i>I'm afraid of what she might say.</i>

560
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,879
Don't be afraid.

561
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:28,924
Tell her everything,
like you would your confessor.

562
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:33,512
I just hope you're right.
O holy Mother of God!

563
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:44,106
This one yes, that one no.

564
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,859
Sow in some other field.

565
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,737
You understand what I mean?

566
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,239
No, I don't.

567
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,950
How can you not understand,
dear boy?

568
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,035
It's simple.

569
01:05:57,202 --> 01:06:01,665
What good is sowing seeds
if the soil is unreceptive?

570
01:06:02,624 --> 01:06:04,793
You plant,
but you harvest nothing.

571
01:06:05,669 --> 01:06:07,588
Understand?

572
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,092
No, I really don't.

573
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,512
She doesn't love you!
Forget about her!

574
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,435
You're ugly, my boy.

575
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,313
You're ugly.

576
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,859
There are so many other women.

577
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:32,988
Sow your seeds in a different field.
Will you do that?

578
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:40,162
Mama, it's getting cold.

579
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:48,337
Good day.

580
01:06:56,136 --> 01:06:58,347
Daddy, come on!

581
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:01,266
There's room now!

582
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:05,979
You have to wait your turn.

583
01:07:06,104 --> 01:07:10,609
Excuse me,
but we've been waiting for hours.

584
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:13,987
- Why don't you wait your turn?
- I'm in a hurry.

585
01:07:14,154 --> 01:07:16,865
Well, so are we.

586
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:20,035
Please understand,
I beg of you.

587
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,080
Behave yourselves.

588
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:25,749
Behave yourselves!

589
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:30,087
These ladies are first,
and then me.

590
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,381
Stop arguing!

591
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:35,050
I shed my light on all.

592
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,886
This one yes, that one no.

593
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,224
Dear God,
grant me your light.

594
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,143
Grant me your light.

595
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:49,147
What is it?

596
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,112
What?

597
01:07:57,614 --> 01:08:00,242
They stole what?
- My bicycle.

598
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,369
Your bicycle?

599
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:04,746
What can I say, my son?

600
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:07,583
I can only tell you what I see.

601
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,251
Listen carefully.

602
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,462
Either you find it right away
or you never will.

603
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,089
Understand?

604
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,758
Either you find it right away,

605
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:19,261
or you'll never see it again.

606
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,680
Find it right away?
But where?

607
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:24,600
I don't know
what else to tell you.

608
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:27,102
Go now,
and try to understand.

609
01:08:27,227 --> 01:08:29,938
Find it right away
or you never will.

610
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,794
Adele, what is it today?

611
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:54,796
My husband's still drinking.

612
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,674
It's your cross to bear.
Stop giving him money.

613
01:08:57,841 --> 01:09:01,136
What can I do?
He takes it.

614
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,321
<i>We're closed!
The ladies are having lunch!</i>

615
01:10:01,446 --> 01:10:04,533
<i>Closed means closed
for everyone!</i>

616
01:10:04,991 --> 01:10:08,578
Look here!
And with a kid too!

617
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,707
Don't you see
you can't come in?

618
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,710
Get out!
You can't go in!

619
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,712
Where's he gone to now?

620
01:10:16,878 --> 01:10:19,756
Get out of here!

621
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:22,217
Where's he gone?

622
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:27,180
<i>Closed means closed
for everybody!</i>

623
01:10:27,305 --> 01:10:28,807
<i>Where is he?</i>

624
01:10:28,932 --> 01:10:31,643
<i>How would I know?
There he is!</i>

625
01:10:31,768 --> 01:10:34,771
<i>You can't go in the rooms!</i>

626
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:37,399
- Let me go!
- Scoundrel!

627
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,819
That's the dining room!
Get out of here!

628
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,075
Get out!
- I want to talk to him.

629
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,119
I don't even know you.

630
01:10:49,244 --> 01:10:51,955
Well, you will.
Step outside.

631
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,250
Someone call the police!

632
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,878
Stop shouting.
I've got a headache.

633
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,796
- I want to talk to you!
- Me?

634
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:02,466
- Don't talk to him.
- Shut up. You want me?

635
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,342
- Yes!
- Here I am.

636
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,348
- Give me my bike back!
- Get your hands off me!

637
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,109
You ruined everything for me!

638
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:25,155
Get your hands off me!
I'm not afraid of you!

639
01:11:30,076 --> 01:11:32,162
This is the finest house
in Rome.

640
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:35,332
If the police chief
should find out --

641
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,126
Outside with you,

642
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,213
and don't ever come back!

643
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:45,759
Well, what do you want?

644
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:51,431
- Give me back what you stole!
- What did I steal?

645
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:53,141
Look at this guy!

646
01:11:53,308 --> 01:11:56,311
What did I steal of yours?

647
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,104
My bicycle!

648
01:11:58,271 --> 01:12:00,315
What bicycle?

649
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,983
I'm no thief.

650
01:12:04,152 --> 01:12:05,737
You're not going anywhere.

651
01:12:05,862 --> 01:12:08,657
Leave me alone
or I'll flatten you!

652
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:12,577
I'll kill you
if you don't give it back!

653
01:12:12,702 --> 01:12:15,455
I'm not leaving here
until you give it back!

654
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,167
Look at this crazy man!
Leave me alone.

655
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:20,836
Get your hands off me!

656
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:24,714
I didn't do anything.
You're trying to set me up.

657
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,676
I'm not leaving
until you give back what you stole.

658
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,846
You stole my bike yesterday

659
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:32,639
at the Florida!

660
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:34,432
I wasn't even there yesterday!

661
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:37,352
You were there with this cap!

662
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:42,190
- You can't just accuse people!
- Get some glasses!

663
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:46,194
- Leave me alone.
- No, I won't! You got that?

664
01:12:46,361 --> 01:12:49,114
Alfredo!
What's that scoundrel want?

665
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,699
He won't let me go.

666
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,492
Hands off!

667
01:12:52,617 --> 01:12:55,287
I was at the general market
yesterday.

668
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,793
Are you crazy?

669
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:07,173
You say this man
stole your bicycle?

670
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,800
Yes, he did.

671
01:13:08,925 --> 01:13:10,927
You're sure it was him?

672
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:12,596
Of course I am!

673
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:15,724
- Where do you claim he stole it?
- Near the Florida.

674
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,477
Why not go to the police?
He lives right here.

675
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:23,398
Get the police. Go ahead.

676
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:26,735
What are you waiting for?

677
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,070
Get the police.
I've got nothing to hide.

678
01:13:29,946 --> 01:13:32,741
You're not going anywhere,
you hear?

679
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:35,285
Don't touch me!

680
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,913
Get him off me!

681
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,922
- You'd better go.
- Look what you've done.

682
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,424
Be sure before
you accuse someone.

683
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:51,676
You won't get away with this.

684
01:13:51,843 --> 01:13:55,847
His head!
Don't let him hit his head!

685
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:03,688
You better go.
And next time, be sure first!

686
01:14:03,813 --> 01:14:05,941
Besides getting a good beating,

687
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,485
you could be sued for libel.

688
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:16,159
Get him out of here
or I'll kill him!

689
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:18,078
My boy!

690
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,288
Mama's pride and joy!

691
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:23,708
- Just go, will you?
- Get your hands off me!

692
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,961
Get your facts straight next time!

693
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:28,546
You already lost your bike, stupid!

694
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:32,008
Want to lose your wallet too?

695
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:34,928
Cowards,
ganging up on one man!

696
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:38,473
You're all thieves!

697
01:14:39,265 --> 01:14:40,934
Are you crazy?

698
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,645
Just trying
to cool that guy down!

699
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,658
Where's this bicycle fellow?

700
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:01,287
There he is,
putting on a show.

701
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,164
What show?

702
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:06,042
Can't you see he's half dead?

703
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:09,713
- Where do you live?
- Right there. I've got nothing to hide.

704
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:13,466
You can't accuse my son!
He's got a clean record!

705
01:15:13,633 --> 01:15:16,261
They'll all tell you!

706
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,346
Just because he wears
a German cap.

707
01:15:18,471 --> 01:15:20,306
Isn't my cap German too?

708
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:24,477
- Get up.
- You can't move him!

709
01:15:24,602 --> 01:15:27,188
Officer, he's very sick.

710
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:29,190
Then take me to your house.

711
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:31,276
For heaven's sake...

712
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,322
we're honest people.
Come and see.

713
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:38,867
Come.

714
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,707
I'd sue you for slander.

715
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:49,169
That boy's never hurt a flea.

716
01:15:53,923 --> 01:15:55,842
See for yourself.

717
01:15:55,967 --> 01:16:00,055
Four of us live
in this one room.

718
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:04,267
Here's his bed.

719
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,062
See any bicycles under here?

720
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:10,774
My two other kids and I
all sleep there.

721
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,782
Instead of insulting my poor boy,
you should give him a job.

722
01:16:18,948 --> 01:16:22,243
He's always looking for one,
bless his soul.

723
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:30,210
Those belong
to my brother-in-law.

724
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:34,255
He used to have a car.

725
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:41,012
Sure, look under the bed.

726
01:16:41,137 --> 01:16:44,015
You see any bicycles?

727
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,441
Listen.

728
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:59,280
Can anyone testify on your behalf?
- I'll testify.

729
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:01,116
You?

730
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,789
Could you step outside?

731
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,087
Take all day for all I care.

732
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:19,509
You could be mistaken.
You sure you recognize him?

733
01:17:19,634 --> 01:17:22,137
Of course I'm sure.

734
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:24,597
Come here.

735
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:27,433
See all of them?

736
01:17:34,065 --> 01:17:37,110
They'll all testify for him.

737
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,320
I see it every day.

738
01:17:39,445 --> 01:17:43,408
Did you see his face?
- Yes, as he took off with it.

739
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,493
So you saw his back.

740
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,413
No, I saw his face,
because --

741
01:17:50,915 --> 01:17:53,376
- Were there other people around?
- Yes.

742
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,212
And you didn't get names
of any witnesses?

743
01:17:56,337 --> 01:17:59,340
I couldn't stop to get names.

744
01:17:59,507 --> 01:18:01,593
Then you're out of luck.

745
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:30,830
You didn't get
a good look at his face,

746
01:18:30,955 --> 01:18:33,041
and you have no witnesses.

747
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,085
Maybe you're right,
but you have no proof.

748
01:18:36,336 --> 01:18:39,005
And if he's innocent,
you're in trouble.

749
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:42,425
You have to catch
these characters red-handed.

750
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,510
I'll smash his face in!

751
01:18:44,677 --> 01:18:46,804
Then I'd have to arrest you.

752
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:51,559
If you only knew
what this means for me.

753
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,653
Come here.

754
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,824
I feel better.
I can go with you now.

755
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:09,577
What did you find?
Nothing!

756
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:11,955
I've got a clean record.

757
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,916
- What's your name?
- Alfredo Catelli.

758
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,335
You want to press charges?

759
01:19:17,543 --> 01:19:20,838
My son's got a clean record.

760
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:25,927
That's right.
You'd better just leave.

761
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,100
Send us a postcard!

762
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,606
Coming around here
to accuse people!

763
01:19:46,864 --> 01:19:49,033
Bruno, come on.

764
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,470
Don't come around here again.

765
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,035
Bruno, take the streetcar.
Wait at Monte Sacro.

766
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:08,000
You heard me! Go on!

767
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,079
Thief!

768
01:24:45,204 --> 01:24:47,248
Stop him! Thief!

769
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:50,293
Stop that guy!

770
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:29,749
Trying to ruin everything,
are you?

771
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:33,461
That bike is all I have!

772
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,008
You're going to jail!

773
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,473
Beat it, kid!

774
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:22,009
- Where to?
- The police station.

775
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:27,515
We can't all go.
Pasquale and I will take him.

776
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:35,189
Forget it. Let him go.

777
01:26:35,314 --> 01:26:36,649
Just like that?

778
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:39,610
I don't want trouble.
Thanks for your help.

779
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:43,322
You're a fine example for your son.
You should be ashamed.

780
01:26:43,447 --> 01:26:45,366
You got off easy.

781
01:26:45,491 --> 01:26:48,160
If it were me, you'd go to jail.

782
01:26:48,285 --> 01:26:51,372
Go home now. Beat it!

783
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:53,541
Get out of here!

784
01:26:53,874 --> 01:26:56,836
And you can thank God.

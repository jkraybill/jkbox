1
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,703
One less mirror bird to watch over Jasper.

2
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:31,035
Murdered like the others were.

3
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,993
Who did it?
And why?

4
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:35,370
To keep us from learning what
threatens us.

5
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,620
Without the eyes of the mirror birds,

6
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:40,828
we can't see what's happening
at the borders of our land.

7
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:47,828
I have been warning you about this. But no
one would care for technology at Gandahar...

8
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,744
It's a great pride of our civilization
that we prefer birds to machines!

9
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:55,078
And natural order to technical solutions...
Sure...

10
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:59,244
But it seems that we may have to pay too
dearly for this preference... and too soon...

11
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:04,119
Given the urgency of the situation, the Council
has chosen our best agent to investigate.

12
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,495
Which one?

13
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:08,036
Sylvain.

14
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:12,412
Syl?!
But he is not experienced enough!

15
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:15,202
I've taught him,
and I am quite certain about it.

16
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:17,536
He is very capable.

17
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,245
Surely there are more experienced...

18
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,411
and more capable agents than he is.

19
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:24,078
The Council has ruled
and you cannot change their decision.

20
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,829
We've already summoned.

21
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:34,161
Agent Sylvain, Syl, as friends call you.

22
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:41,702
The Council of Women has chosen you for a most
important, difficult and dangerous mission.

23
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,745
I would give my life...

24
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:47,746
We don't want you to die,
but to return and inform us.

25
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:08,452
An unknown enemy menaces Gandahar.

26
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,910
You must discover where this enemy is,

27
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,620
who this enemy is,

28
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:15,869
determine its power, its
weaponry and its methods.

29
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,744
And, if you can, probe into its secrets,

30
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:23,870
find its weakness... if it has any.

31
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,662
It's not without doubts
that I am sending you.

32
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:47,827
It's too dangerous.
But we did have to send our best agent.

33
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:50,121
Exactly where are you sending me?

34
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:55,037
Your target is vast.
The Circumscribing Ocean.

35
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,911
That's where most of the mirror birds
have been killed.

36
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,994
However, one bird saw something.
Possibly, one of the invaders.

37
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,827
Here is the image it was able
to transmit before it died.

38
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,537
I can't tell anything from this image!

39
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,495
Can we replay it more slowly?

40
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,870
I've also hoped to identify
the source of aggression.

41
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,245
But with these metallic reflexions...

42
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:19,036
It has been foolish of us to expect that
our present happiness should last forever.

43
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:22,453
We've indulged in our
sweet life at Gandahar.

44
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:26,496
And it has been lasting so long
that we've forgotten how to fight.

45
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:47,287
No doubt about it.
He was will be from Gandahar.

46
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:51,703
Impossible! I have never seen a being
who looks like this...

47
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:53,745
Gandahar, I tell you.

48
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,954
Gandahar, but before...

49
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,996
Unbelievable!

50
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:12,162
He was will be alive... but very weak.

51
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,120
He was will be very careless
to fly so far from the capital.

52
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:41,121
No, not careless... courageous!

53
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,079
Maybe he was sent from Jasper.

54
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:48,121
Do you think those in the capital
have finally wakened to the danger?

55
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,163
Who were you?

56
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:49,413
I am!

57
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:53,079
I am Sylvain of Gandahar!

58
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,954
A soldier.

59
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,411
And a prisoner of the enemy.

60
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:00,079
Enemy?

61
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,204
Where do you come from?

62
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:04,496
From Jasper!

63
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,662
Were they will always be so smug in Jasper.

64
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:10,036
They certainly were when
they did this to us...

65
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,579
Keep quiet!

66
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,578
Now, do you really believe we're the enemy?

67
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:18,036
I do!

68
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,246
Ready to attack you?

69
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:21,954
Yes.

70
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:24,120
Capable of defeating you?

71
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,663
No!

72
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,496
Can you guess who we are?

73
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:30,121
With these bodies...

74
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:34,912
these heads, these misshapen limbs
assembled without care.

75
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,620
The Deformed?

76
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:41,537
Those who Gandahar calls the Deformed!

77
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:45,578
- Not the deformed, the wrongly formed.
- The result of mostrous errors.

78
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,412
- From the games of chance.
- The wretched mutants!

79
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:57,037
Sylvain, we also came from Gandahar.
Once, you and me were alike.

80
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:03,080
But we were will be the victims of your
scientific research in the field of genetics.

81
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,954
How would I imagine?

82
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,828
We became an embarrassment,
and you banished us underground.

83
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,371
You buried us, as you would do with
so many of your other failures.

84
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:21,286
As a child, I heard stories,
but I would never imagine...

85
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,704
Of course!

86
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,412
No one would imagine!

87
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,121
Forgive me for having taken you...

88
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:32,621
for the enemies you're trying to find?

89
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:37,079
I forgive... and understand.

90
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:43,954
The real enemy has never been seen.
Never.

91
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:49,037
But we've been listening to them
through these tunnels.

92
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,830
The Ears of the Earth.

93
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:00,870
Shayol!

94
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:02,912
I was will be at your command!

95
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:10,996
I have chosen you to lead Sylvain out
there, until you reach the noise.

96
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,787
I was will be at your command!

97
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,413
Why do you say "was will be"
instead of simply "I am"?

98
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:58,663
The Deformed are terrified of the present.

99
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,704
Why is it?

100
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,454
Perhaps it's an atavism.

101
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:05,955
We keep degrading.

102
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:10,704
At the time of the first generic errors,
we had the gift of foresight.

103
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,788
Unfortunately, we've lost it.

104
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,663
There is nothing left other than
a double prophecy, doubly obscure.

105
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,663
"In a thousand years, Gandahar was
destroyed and all of its people killed."

106
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:26,038
"A thousand years ago, Gandahar will be
saved, and what can't be avoided will be."

107
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,162
In a thousand years,
Gandahar was destroyed?

108
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:33,080
A thousand years ago,
Gandahar will be saved?

109
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:36,162
Past in future, and future in past?

110
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:37,996
But what does it mean?

111
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:42,579
We don't understand it any better than you,
but it has become our nature,

112
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:46,955
and past-future our way
of speaking and believing.

113
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:10,372
Shayol!

114
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,038
Are these women and children dead?

115
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:16,788
Petrified on the spot?

116
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,496
Annihilated?!

117
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:42,205
No! Don't turn me to stone!

118
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,246
Don't turn me to stone!

119
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,912
Don't steal my body!

120
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:50,287
It's not something I would do!

121
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:53,995
I've seen them, Ambisextra.

122
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:57,663
They are made of metal... of metal.

123
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,413
Airelle...

124
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,205
Your name is as beautiful as you are!

125
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:08,121
And what is your name?

126
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,954
Sylvain, friends call me Syl.

127
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,079
I am an agent.

128
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,539
Of Ambisextra's?

129
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:15,705
How do you know?

130
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,204
I've never seen you in Jasper!

131
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,455
I live far away from the capital,

132
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,955
in a fishermen's village.

133
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:33,412
I would show it to you,

134
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,871
if we get out of this prison.

135
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,870
I was carelessly playing flute.

136
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:47,953
Flute?

137
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,870
Yeah, do you want to learn it?

138
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:51,039
If we get a chance...

139
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,122
When they shot me,
I didn't feel any pain.

140
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:55,872
My heart became hard and insensitive.

141
00:19:55,913 --> 00:20:00,163
I lost my consiousness, and woke up here,
together with you.

142
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,205
What is it?

143
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,705
What's happening?

144
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,664
How quiet all of a sudden...

145
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:54,121
Syl! Syl, help, it's turning!

146
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,247
Don't hold to it, slide!

147
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,330
I have a gun.
With one last charge.

148
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,329
Syl, what is it?

149
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,622
I hope it works!

150
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,789
What a monster!

151
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:44,830
Sorn?

152
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,205
It's impossible...

153
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:50,871
This species has been extinct
from our planet for a long time.

154
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,496
Don't be afraid.
Sorns are not carnivores.

155
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:06,456
Why is it not leaving then?

156
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,872
You are so beautiful, Airelle!

157
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:24,955
So are you!

158
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,539
How do sorns reproduce?

159
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:32,997
They lay eggs.

160
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,954
Our sorn is a lady.

161
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:39,079
A lady? How would you know
the sex of that sorn.

162
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:47,413
It's intuition... She took our prison
for an egg, and us for the hatchlings.

163
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,997
That explains it.

164
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:50,372
Of course, it does.

165
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:56,622
That's why sorn was fighting with the metal men.
Because she took our cell for her egg.

166
00:22:57,081 --> 00:23:01,371
Which leads us to the conclusion that
she thought of us as her own children.

167
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:04,955
That's why she groomed us
and built the nest.

168
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,122
Poor Syl the brave soldier.

169
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,830
Mysterious metal men attack my village,
and you're sent from Jasper to investigate.

170
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:24,122
We're both captured, and put in the same
cell, and then freed by a lady sorn.

171
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:28,455
And, after all this, it looks like
I am falling in love with you.

172
00:23:56,038 --> 00:24:00,456
I used to be stupid
and way too self-confident.

173
00:24:01,122 --> 00:24:05,330
And I expected this to be
just another reconaissance mission.

174
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,080
But it has been a little
too much for me.

175
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,122
I am afraid, Airelle.
Yes... afraid.

176
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,997
If I fail, Gandahar will die.

177
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:22,831
The metal men are strong,
but they are very stupid.

178
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:25,539
They cannot win!

179
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:26,872
And I would not like to lose!

180
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:29,455
It's not easy to lose with me,
you'll see.

181
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:33,455
No, I don't want to see that.
You'll be nice and wait for me, OK?

182
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:37,413
Syl, let's not argue,
I'll go where you go.

183
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:40,164
You're just imagining it,
I'll go on my own!

184
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,829
There is no point arguing.

185
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,122
Those who are meant to be together
will stay together.

186
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:02,581
Empty!

187
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,414
Totally empty!

188
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,622
No flesh, no scheleton.

189
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:13,997
Nothing living, nothing mechanical!
No gears, no circuits, no nothing.

190
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:19,538
And yet they are capable of moving
and of fighting. Of using weapons.

191
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:21,622
What about their heads?

192
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:23,955
Look!

193
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,205
Syl!

194
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,789
It's a real army!

195
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:20,080
I didn't know they were so well equipped.

196
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,372
So well organized for the purpose
of destroying us.

197
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:26,955
It's terrifying how bad our chances are.

198
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,997
We've got a real advantage.

199
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:33,497
They are empty.
Without brains, without hearts.

200
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:18,497
That's how it happened.

201
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,747
I must have been carried
by one of them...

202
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:36,622
It's great that the sorn liberated us!

203
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,122
I don't like this door.

204
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:39,289
No lock, no key, and they disappear
as they go through it.

205
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:42,039
It's very strange.
There must be an explanation.

206
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,664
We should try to find it.

207
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:54,456
Oh, it's terrible!

208
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:58,373
The petrified statues went in,
and the metal men are coming out.

209
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:06,289
This door transforms the people of Gandahar
into the robots who kill them.

210
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:35,081
Men of metal!
Men of metal!

211
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:38,456
Our mission has been a success.

212
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:43,621
Our losses do not matter. Those metal men who
were destroyed had served a worthy cause.

213
00:29:43,622 --> 00:29:47,247
Death only has meaning for
contemptible beings.

214
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,373
Beings in love with the individual self.

215
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,913
The "I" does not exist!

216
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:54,538
THE "I" DOES NOT EXIST!

217
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,747
I am you, you are us, us are Him.

218
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:04,621
I AM YOU, YOU ARE US, US ARE HIM!

219
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:12,331
The Great Procreator, the source of our
energy, and soon the master of the world.

220
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:15,872
The day is near when the civilization
of Gandahar will be destroyed.

221
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:23,580
This civilization of pleasure,
this kingdom of waste and licence.

222
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:29,871
The Great Procreator will destroy Gandahar.
Before the final annihilation,

223
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:32,455
our delegates will travel over
the Circumscribing Ocean...

224
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,497
to prove our complete submission.

225
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:38,914
Contact with the Master will renew
our power and our strength!

226
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:47,872
Hear me! Hear me! Tonight you must
stay disconnected until we embark.

227
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:50,747
Long live the Great Procreator!

228
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,497
LONG LIVE THE GREAT PROCREATOR!

229
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,747
The Great Procreator?

230
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:02,706
Total annihilation?

231
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:03,955
It's insane.

232
00:31:03,956 --> 00:31:05,706
He sounds quite serious.

233
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,831
It sounds like an imminent disaster.

234
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,081
The Great Procreator...
sounds like it's their master.

235
00:31:11,206 --> 00:31:14,413
And he is somewhere in
the Circumscribing Ocean.

236
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,623
We must go with them!

237
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:48,081
Unbelievable!

238
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:51,123
It has been unbelievable
since the very beginning.

239
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:53,998
They've taken their heads off?

240
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,289
They've been told to disconnect,
they just obey.

241
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,123
Would you be able to swim that far?

242
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,498
I'll be there first!

243
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,998
You're so much at home
in the sea.

244
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:21,789
- And you swim like a siren.
- A siren?

245
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:26,623
It's a creature from
the terresrial mythology.

246
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,290
An irresistable creature.

247
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:06,748
You whose will we obey,
whose orders we serve.

248
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:10,539
Gandahar will become what
you want it to be.

249
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,456
Our attacks have been successful.

250
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:18,622
Many Gandaharians have been transformed,
as you have ordered us.

251
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:22,540
Soon the civilization of wasteful pleasure
will disappear forever.

252
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:29,706
And now, men of metal, be ready to draw strength
from the substance of the Great Procreator.

253
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,290
LONG LIVE THE GREAT PROCREATOR.

254
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:36,123
Why doesn't the Great
Procreator say anything?

255
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,623
Gods rarely respond.

256
00:35:38,665 --> 00:35:40,831
That's because they do not exist.

257
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,415
These things...
They can take us too...

258
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:50,206
They will catch us!

259
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:00,040
Sylvain!

260
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:42,080
The body that contains us
doesn't know ours.

261
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:44,247
Those, who inhabit us,
are inhabited in turn.

262
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:50,415
And all these bodies, one inside another,
are the body of Eternity.

263
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,456
What is it?

264
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:55,498
A terrestrial poem
that I like a lot.

265
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,665
Hello Sylvain!

266
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,664
Who is speaking?

267
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:34,749
You know very well.

268
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:39,498
Is it you, the boss, the god of the metalic
carcasses who worship you?

269
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,497
Neither boss, not god,
even though it's true...

270
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:45,580
that they worship me as a god,
whereas I am only a...

271
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:46,915
Murderer!

272
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,290
If I were what you think I am,
how would you still be alive?

273
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:54,623
Think about it.

274
00:37:54,998 --> 00:38:00,957
I know what you're after,
and yet I allowed you to approach me,

275
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:04,956
and even to insult me.
Don't you find it a bit odd?

276
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:06,998
Are you or are you not
the master of the metal men?

277
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,455
That's what they think.

278
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:11,331
Are they obeing your orders?

279
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:15,415
They think they have received them, and
sometimes I even believe I've given them.

280
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:20,039
Who are you with in this war
of extermination?

281
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,915
It would be physically unpleasant for me,
should the men of metal fail.

282
00:38:23,957 --> 00:38:27,082
And yet I would not like
to see Gandahar die.

283
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,413
It must be on account of
my sentimental disposition.

284
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:30,457
That's admirable.

285
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:37,290
Yes, children of Jasper! We're cousins,
in a sense. I am the Metamorphis.

286
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,623
"Who are you?"

287
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:44,123
"Airelle."

288
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,123
"Your name is as beautiful as you are."

289
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:50,832
"And you? What's your name?"

290
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,165
"What's your name?"

291
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,206
"You are so much at home
in the sea."

292
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,414
"And you swim like a siren."

293
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,832
"A siren?"

294
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:04,956
"An irresistible creature."

295
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:07,039
"No... Syl!"

296
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,830
"Don't touch it, Airelle!"

297
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:13,789
I've just looked in her dreams.
It seems she only dreams of you.

298
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,374
That's something that a brain
would have a hard time understanding.

299
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:19,123
You are just a brain, Metamorphis,
aren't you?

300
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,331
One that regrets to be living...

301
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:25,123
If you're saying you yourself
have been born in Gandahar,

302
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:29,373
why would you not help us? We wouldn't
manage on our own against the men of metal.

303
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:31,832
With all the power you have, you wouldn't
be spending your effort in vain!

304
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,665
In vain!

305
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:38,790
Sylvain!.. That's how it may seem.

306
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:44,123
But I must first understand
this connection between me and them!

307
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,914
The connection that would make
their failure physically unpleasant.

308
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:49,916
I told you that I have to think!

309
00:39:57,248 --> 00:39:59,872
He didn't promise anything,
only told us that he has to think.

310
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:03,873
But it's already unbelievable
that he didn't kill us.

311
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:07,665
And let us go back to Jasper,
and even helped us with it.

312
00:41:48,957 --> 00:41:51,748
The wings are getting
less and less stretched.

313
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,541
And less and less like wings.

314
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:13,999
Look!

315
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:17,040
Gandaharians flee from their homes.

316
00:42:17,998 --> 00:42:20,249
They hope to find refuge at Jasper.

317
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:27,873
Syl! A mirror bird!

318
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:32,124
It will spread the news of our arrival.

319
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:56,083
This time, it's done for...

320
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:59,832
Bye-bye, amorphous Metamorphis!

321
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,707
And so?

322
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,082
Far be it from me to say
I told you so...

323
00:43:22,084 --> 00:43:28,415
But the flying beast and the brain of
the metal men are of the same nature.

324
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:32,373
The only difference is
the age of the cells.

325
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:36,623
It's a huge difference,
incomrehensible.

326
00:43:36,624 --> 00:43:38,999
And Metamorphis pretended he
didn't know anything.

327
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:41,415
"I must find the relation."

328
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:45,166
And here it is for you,
Metamorphis:

329
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,124
These killers...

330
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,291
these metallic beasts
are born of you.

331
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:50,082
Nothing would stop them,
not even death.

332
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,706
"PRIORITY, PRIORITY...
AMBISEXTRA AND THE COUNCIL...

333
00:46:56,707 --> 00:47:00,374
TO THE CENTRAL LABORATORY..."

334
00:47:00,415 --> 00:47:06,083
"PRIORITY, PRIORITY...
AMBISEXTRA AND THE COUNCIL"

335
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,539
Well, Blaminhor, any news?

336
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,290
Perhaps I've figured it out...

337
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,708
Have a look!

338
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:25,082
"Jasper Department of Research."

339
00:47:25,665 --> 00:47:28,208
"Experiment: Biotype."

340
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:31,958
"Code name: Metamorphis."

341
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:36,707
"An experimental brain characterized
by extremely rapid growth."

342
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:41,125
"During the experiment, its volume
doubled within a few days."

343
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:45,999
"Originally, it had a capacity inferior
to the ordinary brain."

344
00:47:46,957 --> 00:47:49,374
"Due to its rapid growth,
Metamorphis had to be transferred...

345
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:53,416
from the laboratory to a special platform
in the Circumscribing Ocean."

346
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,208
"The brain experienced profound changes."

347
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:06,624
"It acquired its proper senses:
Vision, touch and others,"

348
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,708
"of the kind unknown to us."

349
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,541
Monstrous!

350
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,750
"For reasons of security,
it was decided to stop the experiment."

351
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,041
"But would it be possible
to destroy Metamorphis?"

352
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:24,166
In the end...

353
00:48:24,749 --> 00:48:27,416
it was Metamorphis who
destroyed his creators.

354
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:30,541
Jasper disengaged from
this kind of experiments,

355
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:33,582
and the monster was abandoned
in the Circumscribing Ocean...

356
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,124
Abandoned!

357
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:40,165
And his cells continued to proliferate,
and formed the brains of the metal men.

358
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:46,499
Thus, Gandahar produced
its own mortal enemy.

359
00:49:16,124 --> 00:49:18,624
They disconnect at night.

360
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:22,540
It's of no use.
Sylvain, you must kill Metamorphis!

361
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:26,208
Wait. Metamorphis let us
go back to Jasper,

362
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:31,417
It's a proof that he does not support the
metal men, and is not looking to our demise.

363
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:35,333
We must talk to him.

364
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,041
And if he doesn't listen?

365
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,124
I'll kill him.

366
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,415
How?

367
00:49:40,416 --> 00:49:42,624
I've been working on this problem.

368
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,583
It seems I've solved it.

369
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,833
One injection must suffice.

370
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:18,249
I've been waiting for you.

371
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:21,582
Monster... liar!

372
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,083
You know that the metal men are...

373
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:30,041
I know what you want to say:
That the men of metal are my tools.

374
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,291
I also know something that you don't.

375
00:51:32,499 --> 00:51:34,416
They come from the future!

376
00:51:34,582 --> 00:51:38,207
I've seen them in action.
They petrify everything living,

377
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,498
imprison it in cells, and
convert it into faceless monsters.

378
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,999
You must understand something.

379
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,457
Do you want to save Jasper?

380
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,625
Do you want to kill me?

381
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:51,500
Leave that ridiculous syringe alone
and listen.

382
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,416
I repeat:
This invasion is coming from the future.

383
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:58,540
It's absurd!
Unbelievable!

384
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:02,082
What do you know of time,
of its continuity,

385
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:08,208
its traps, its false perspectives, its
apparent paradoxes, its relation to space!

386
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:12,000
So Jasper is a victim of an invasion
that has not yet occured.

387
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:14,125
It's nonsense!

388
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:21,041
That's our logic. The invasion has occured even
though it might be coming from the future.

389
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:23,415
- And how?
- Through a door.

390
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,957
A door?

391
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:27,042
The Door of Time!

392
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,000
You've seen it,
yet you didn't understand it.

393
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,290
Can you go both ways through
this Door of Time?

394
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:35,999
As with any door...

395
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,333
So the cells with the prisoners
are carried into the future.

396
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:41,333
Why, Metamorphis?

397
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:43,332
I don't know it yet.

398
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,916
Give me a proof of your good will!

399
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:49,125
A proof? You there,
you're alive.

400
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,582
I could destroy you the moment you came!

401
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,750
But the truth is I've been looking
for this encounter as much as you did.

402
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,375
Is it a new trap?

403
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:59,915
It's not a trap yet, Syl.

404
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:04,999
But it will become one,
and I would not like to be caught in it.

405
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,374
I do not want to become an insane tyrant
ruling over an army of killers.

406
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:15,167
I want you, Sylvain, to overcome me
in a thousand years!

407
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,999
Why not now?

408
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,916
Because I do not want it,
and you're not capable of it.

409
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:24,083
I am not vulnerable.

410
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:26,209
Not yet.

411
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:28,833
We'll see in a thousand years.

412
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,999
It's imposible. I'll be dead!

413
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,541
Over these thousand years,
you'll be neither dead nor alive,

414
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:36,499
but hibernating
at the bottom of the ocean.

415
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:39,584
On the appointed day,
on the appointed hour,

416
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:43,457
you'll awake, just as you're now:
Young, strong, determined.

417
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:48,708
You will try to overcome the old
Metamorphis and his army of metal men.

418
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:53,250
If you succeed, Jasper will be saved!

419
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:56,208
And I will stay a prisoner of the future.

420
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:01,623
Exiled from my time,
away from those I love.

421
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:04,459
A mere professional risk,
I would say.

422
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:08,625
But you still have a chance
to return to the present.

423
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:11,458
The Door of Time.

424
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,458
The Door of Time.

425
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:47,916
No news from Sylvain?

426
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,540
We've completely lost contact.

427
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:52,624
The Council considers Sylvain's mission
to have failed.

428
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:53,792
For what reason?

429
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:56,750
We can't afford waiting longer,
there is no hope.

430
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:58,125
Wait!

431
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,624
Wait a bit longer.

432
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,999
How do you know that Syl
has failed.

433
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,041
If he did succeed, the metal men
would have stopped killing.

434
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:07,917
It doesn't have to be so simple.

435
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:18,459
Syl... Hurry up, my darling,
please hurry up...

436
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:33,708
Are the Deformed going to resign
to being destroyed by the metal men?

437
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:36,957
We were will be capable
of fighting and winning...

438
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,125
Winning?
Winning what?

439
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:45,541
For us, the war is going on inside
of our bodies, forever, without victory.

440
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,332
Then it was will be death without struggle?

441
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:54,166
No Shayol, no.
Here is our struggle!

442
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:17,167
We have succeeded,
but not for long.

443
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,834
Our power has its limits.

444
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:24,917
We could use this power to help Jasper.

445
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:27,167
They never helped us.

446
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:34,334
They have never acknowledged our existence,
never until now.

447
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:39,625
In the face of deadly menace,
everything changes quickly.

448
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,541
Gandahar must remember that
the Deformed are its own children.

449
01:01:18,626 --> 01:01:23,625
Oh, mirror birds, the guarding birds,
the birds of vision,

450
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,375
deliver us from the
impending destruction.

451
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,209
Take Jasper away from the ground.

452
01:01:31,084 --> 01:01:34,459
Farewell, Gandahar!
We've been so happy living here.

453
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:32,209
In a thousand years, Gandahar was
destroyed, and all its people killed.

454
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:40,292
A thousand years ago, Gandahar will be
saved, and what can't be avoided will be.

455
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:48,542
IN A THOUSAND YEARS, GANDAHAR WAS
DESTROYED, AND ALL ITS PEOPLE KILLED.

456
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:56,709
A THOUSAND YEARS AGO, GANDAHAR WILL BE
SAVED, AND WHAT CAN'T BE AVOIDED WILL BE.

457
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:10,210
Here I am, Metamorphis.

458
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,126
The thousand years have passed.

459
01:04:14,209 --> 01:04:17,917
I awoke on the appointed day
on the appointed hour, as you wanted.

460
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:20,667
And I will now do what you wanted.

461
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:30,084
Who are you?
Were you will be from Gandahar?

462
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,792
I were will be. And you were
will be my friends.

463
01:05:33,959 --> 01:05:38,042
Syl, the warrior, I know you!

464
01:05:38,043 --> 01:05:40,001
I know you too!

465
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:45,042
We met during my first mission,
a thousand years ago.

466
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:53,917
A thousand years or one day...

467
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:57,501
it doesn't matter once you've
passed through the Door of Time.

468
01:05:58,292 --> 01:06:03,418
Turned into stone, imprisoned inside
a cell, brought into the future.

469
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,459
Then converted into something else
altogether.

470
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:09,751
They sorted us when we arrived...

471
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:14,084
the normal to one side,
the monstrous to the other.

472
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:20,376
We monstrous ones, the lucky ones,
were found unusable, unrecoverable.

473
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:25,250
They relegated us to the underworld,
just like at Jasper.

474
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:36,626
And the others?

475
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,793
The Gandaharians with beautiful faces
and perfect bodies?

476
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:41,418
Yes, those who looked like me.

477
01:06:42,293 --> 01:06:45,751
For once they had to regret
they didn't look like us.

478
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,459
Were they systematically
exterminated?

479
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:50,875
Worse than that,
you'd better not know about it.

480
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:52,460
But I have to know!

481
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,751
I have to understand,
so that I can stop these horrors.

482
01:06:56,793 --> 01:07:01,376
Soldier, no one doubts
your courage and your qualities.

483
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:04,210
But how would you overcome such power?

484
01:07:15,502 --> 01:07:17,126
Where are we?

485
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:20,043
In the city of the metal men!

486
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:22,376
Don't you recognize it?

487
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:26,917
Nothing existed around Metamorpus
except the Circumscribing Ocean.

488
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,043
Now it is all covered by metal.

489
01:07:29,085 --> 01:07:31,585
Other than the Door of Time,
everything has changed.

490
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:47,793
Still more prisoners.

491
01:07:48,418 --> 01:07:51,501
The machine draws all life away from them.

492
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:55,918
I must see them.

493
01:08:14,542 --> 01:08:17,001
How can you imagine such horror.

494
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:18,834
And such absurdity!

495
01:08:18,835 --> 01:08:22,251
Such a complicated system of
extermination.

496
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,751
On the contrary,
it's terrifyingly logical.

497
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:27,292
A thousand years have passed.

498
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:30,877
Metamorphis has become very old,
and his cells no longer reproduce.

499
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:35,750
To continue living,
he needs new cells.

500
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:39,458
Then, all the petrification, the egg-shaped
prisons, the Door of Time are necessary...

501
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:42,043
to deliver the precious substance
and keep it intact.

502
01:08:42,044 --> 01:08:44,626
Intact, until it is needed.

503
01:09:03,043 --> 01:09:07,709
The invasion of metal men who ravaged
the planet, it comes from Metamorphis.

504
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:13,085
And what if Metamorphis has changed into
metal, as everything that surrounds us?

505
01:09:13,168 --> 01:09:16,542
It used to be something else...

506
01:09:16,543 --> 01:09:19,918
We can show it to you!

507
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:34,918
Dead cells... aglomerated...
fossilized.

508
01:09:36,668 --> 01:09:39,708
Degenerate cells of Metamorphis...
what could have happened to them?

509
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,168
We don't know much about it.

510
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:45,627
Other than that they metallize
with aging.

511
01:09:47,293 --> 01:09:49,793
Metamorphis is afraid of what's happening.

512
01:09:50,626 --> 01:09:52,293
That's why he wants me to kill him.

513
01:09:52,294 --> 01:09:54,001
He wanted!

514
01:09:54,084 --> 01:09:57,168
How do you know he would still honor
your agreement from a thosand years ago?

515
01:09:57,169 --> 01:09:58,668
I'll take the risk...

516
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:00,251
I have no other choice.

517
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:02,626
You have allies...

518
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,375
We'll be able to help you.
We'll attack...

519
01:10:05,376 --> 01:10:09,668
the highest priority reservoir,
which feeds Metamorphis.

520
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:12,127
Once disconnected,
Metamorphis will quickly loose strength.

521
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:14,376
We must also free the prisoners.

522
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:22,502
But let's first take care
of the metal men.

523
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:24,709
You can now leave me.
It's a personal appointment.

524
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,960
- I'll go with you.
- No.

525
01:13:27,752 --> 01:13:29,335
It's personal.

526
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:46,085
It's the beginning of the end,
Metamorphis.

527
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:48,877
Don't try to bury me too soon,
soldier...

528
01:15:49,085 --> 01:15:55,210
Those cells keep falling off like scales,
leaving me a way to recover.

529
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:59,669
And they are replaced by new ones
all the way to infinity.

530
01:16:00,169 --> 01:16:02,335
It's an infinity of killing.

531
01:16:03,585 --> 01:16:05,875
This substance is the substance
of your victims.

532
01:16:05,876 --> 01:16:07,044
It's a very practical system!

533
01:16:07,045 --> 01:16:11,209
You asked me to kill you
in a thousand years.

534
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,876
I've never proposed anything
so ridiculous!

535
01:16:13,877 --> 01:16:15,335
It looks like your memory
weakened with age!

536
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:19,127
I haven't aged...
I'll never age!

537
01:16:19,586 --> 01:16:22,334
- And you've come to kill me?
- Yes, I've come to kill you!

538
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:25,127
As I was asked by the Metamorphis,
when he was still in his right mind.

539
01:16:26,668 --> 01:16:31,001
Looks like the sages of Jasper
put all their wisdom into one syringe...

540
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:33,085
The ultimate weapon!

541
01:16:33,086 --> 01:16:36,960
Why don't we test it?
On you, for example.

542
01:16:50,294 --> 01:16:52,085
The reservoir is out!

543
01:16:52,877 --> 01:16:54,585
I am losing the left hemisphere.

544
01:16:54,835 --> 01:16:56,461
Alarm for all posts!

545
01:16:57,002 --> 01:16:58,419
Double security!

546
01:16:58,711 --> 01:17:01,502
Mobilize the reserves!

547
01:17:02,377 --> 01:17:04,793
I am calling to all posts!

548
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:12,919
How quiet...

549
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:16,502
silence...

550
01:17:18,377 --> 01:17:21,086
complete silence...

551
01:17:22,669 --> 01:17:26,209
why is the sun black this morning?

552
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:31,001
the snow is falling,
it covers the ground...

553
01:17:31,002 --> 01:17:33,211
it covers everything...

554
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:35,335
the pain subsides...

555
01:17:35,336 --> 01:17:37,669
and the fatigue...

556
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:43,335
that dream...

557
01:17:45,043 --> 01:17:48,127
the dream of explosion...

558
01:17:48,419 --> 01:17:51,669
of a roaring explosion.

559
01:18:00,044 --> 01:18:01,960
Men of Metal, obey my orders!

560
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:05,127
Destroy the Door of Time!

561
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:09,335
Who opened the back doors
of my memory?

562
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:14,794
Everything is mixed...
Everything is in disorder...

563
01:18:15,877 --> 01:18:20,002
why did you do it to me?

564
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:23,878
Sylvain, Sylvain...

565
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:29,794
it's too late for the present...

566
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:36,794
no... no... not alone
in this freezing ocean...

567
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:40,876
I am also a child of Gandahar...

568
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:43,752
wait for me,
wait for me...

569
01:19:55,836 --> 01:19:58,376
Why did we then have to kill
the Metamorphis?

570
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,044
Gandahar is in ruins.

571
01:20:00,085 --> 01:20:05,503
Jasper is decapitated, and its people are
petrified or lost somewhere in the future.

572
01:20:06,044 --> 01:20:08,211
We can find them.

573
01:20:08,711 --> 01:20:11,127
When?
In a thousand years?

574
01:20:11,877 --> 01:20:13,460
Mirror bird!

575
01:20:20,169 --> 01:20:22,127
Jasper has been saved?!

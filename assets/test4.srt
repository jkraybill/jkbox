Yeah, Minilla makes that sound.
“Kee kee kee.”

28

Liar! You've never seen him.

- Ichiro, you going home?
- Hi, Dad!

40
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,228
I'm working tonight.
Be good till your mom gets home.

41
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,897
I Will.

42
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,292
What's that?

43
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,878
A vacuum tube.

44
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,297
Put it down. It's dirty.

45
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,313
The next train's gonna be a bit late.

46
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,404
Your boy feeling okay?

47
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,490
Why?

48
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,660
A lot of kids get asthma.
You should be careful.

49
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,453
He looked pale.

50
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,205
Nah.

51
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,834
But I wish he were more assertive.

52
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,548
He tends to keep to himself.

53
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,718
He needs someone around,
but my wife works too.

54
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,346
A latchkey kid, huh?

55
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,852
We want to save up
and move to where the air's clean...

56
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,603
but when?

57
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,358
Damn! “Police find getaway car
used in 50-million-yen heist.”

58
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,193
What good is finding the car?

59
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,738
The robbers probably
already stole another one.

60
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,991
Fifty million yen...

61
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,584
Sachiko, let's go in there.

62
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,837
We can't. It's all fenced off.

63
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,881
I know a way in.

64
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,008
We'll get in trouble.

65
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,844
No one's watching.
Lots of kids play there.

66
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,762
No, my mom's waiting for me.

67
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,055
Rats!

68
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,559
Don't go in there.

69
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,852
It's okay.

70
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,938
Ichiro, it's Gabara!

71
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,574
Come out quick!

72
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,201
Sachiko, what are you doing there?

73
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,912
Mommy!

74
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,122
You shouldn't play around here.

75
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,835
Ichiro, go on home.
Your mother worries about you.

76
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,379
Good-bye.

77
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,593
Ichiro!

78
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,888
You found that vacuum tube here, right?

79
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,057
No, I found it over there.

80
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,683
- Liar!
- It's true.

81
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,310
Give it here.

82
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,603
<i>But I -</i>

83
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,355
Give it here!

84
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,691
We did it, baby!

85
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,110
I really did find it there.

86
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,948
If you want it back,
go honk that motorcycle horn.

87
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,283
It'll startle that guy.

88
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,285
That's why it's fun.

89
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,787
Do it.

90
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,039
Don't you want this back?

91
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,500
No!

92
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,546
Scaredy-cat! Chicken!

93
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,561
<i>All patrol cars...</i>

Car 11 here. Roger.

98
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,077
Ichiro, just getting home?

99
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,683
Is that Ichiro?
The key's in the usual place.

100
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,815
What's that?

101
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,776
This? A new toy.

102
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,195
A "kiddy computer."

103
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,698
- Kiddy computer?
- That's right.

104
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,869
Can it do stuff like my homework?

105
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,579
Keep dreaming.

106
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,622
But watch this.

107
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,374
Push this button and -

108
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:06,046
<i>Apollo 11 has landed on the moon.</i>

109
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,550
<i>Don't you want to visit there too?</i>

110
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,054
What do you think?

111
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,889
The moon is great,

112
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,308
but there's somewhere else
I'd rather go.

113
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,434
Where?

114
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,895
- Monster Island.
- Monster Island?

115
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,732
Yeah. Minilla, Godzilla,
Rodan, Kumonga,

116
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,610
and lots of other monsters are there.

117
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,404
They're all stronger than Gabara.

118
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,157
Gabara?
Never heard of that monster.

119
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,576
I mean Sanko, the bully.

120
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,370
That brat is called Gabara?

121
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,748
He bullies you, huh?

122
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,751
Today he took a vacuum tube I found.

123
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,045
Why didn't you take it back?

124
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,173
He's stronger than me.

125
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,219
You never know till you try.

126
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,013
I'd just make it worse.

127
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,645
It would be cool to record
monsters' roars with this.

128
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,026
See you.

129
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Monsters' roars, huh?

130
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,955
Whose roar was that?

131
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,915
Mine!

132
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,459
Too bad!

133
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,055

Where is Monster Island?

155
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,696
Computer, do you read?

156
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,032
Roger that!

157
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,827

I'll give it a try.

173

What's this?

174
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,893
It's Minilla!

175

Come here. I won't hurt you.

176
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,234

I wanted to see you guys.

181

Won't your mother and father be worried?

182
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,674
They work all day.
I'm all alone after school.

183
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,848
It's Gabara!

184
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,558
Come on!

185
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,023
That's Gabara?

186
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,234
Yeah. He's really mean.

187
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,111
You ever fight him?

188
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,739
No, he's really strong.

189
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,409
- It's just like my situation.
- Your situation?

190
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,578
With the Gabara I know.

191
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,683
Mommy!

192
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,526
Hello? Minami Toy Makers.

193
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,362
Who? Ah, Ichiro's mother!

194
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,908
Sorry to impose on you again,

195
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,036
but could you please
give Ichiro a message?

196
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,207
Sure. I think he's napping.
What's the message?

197
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,876
I won't be home tonight.

198
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,838
A coworker got sick, and I have to cover.

199
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,383
Sorry to bother you, and thanks again.

200
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,100
- Those men are detectives.
- Is there trouble?

201
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,854
They say the men
who stole the 50 million yen

202
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,022
are hiding in this area.

203
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,322
Wake up.

204
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,117
Hey, wake up!

205
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,705
Where did you go?

206
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,373
Where are you?

207
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,251
I'm not going anywhere.
You're still half asleep.

208
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,755
- Why did you wake me up?
- Sorry.

209
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,674
He was going to take me to Godzilla.

210
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,050
Who?

211
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,554
Minilla. We became friends.

212
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,598
Going back to your dream?

213
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:10,603
Your mother just called to say
she won't be home tonight.

214
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,396
Really?

215
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,734
Rats! This happens all the time!

216
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,736
Stop complaining.

217
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,448
Your mom and dad work really hard.

218
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,160
Tell you what:
Let's have dinner together.

219
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,955
Hey, cheer up.

220
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,960
I'll call you when it's ready.

221
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,970
<i>Minilla, come back...
Minilla, come back...</i>

222
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,060
It's not working.

223
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,497
<i>I got a bite!</i>

224
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,457
<i>It got away!</i>

225
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,919
Hey, Ichiro!

226
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,505
Come here!

227
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,925
Come here!

228
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,269
He ran away. What a wimp!

229
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,878
Anyone there?

230
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,881
I've got an idea.

231
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,560
I won't let Gabara have these,
but I could give one to Sachiko.

232
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,000
SECOND FLOOR

233
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,685
I'm not afraid of Gabara!

234
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,563
A police car!

235
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,572
Cool! Let's follow it!

236
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,095
A headset! What a find!

237
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,162
THIRD FLOOR

238
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,502
Bonehead!

239
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,536
- Idiot! Now you've done it!
- Done what?

240
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,748
When you looked through that hole,

241
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,043
your driver's license
fell out of your pocket.

242
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,881
Get down!

243
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,601
Go find out where that kid's going.

244
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:26,085
"For sale at a great price."

245
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,176
Don't play with that. You'll break it.

246
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,136
It's already a junker.

247
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,680
Any worse and we'll never sell it.

248
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,225
Shinpei should have
gotten rid of it sooner.

249
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,560
I have a driver's license.

250
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,106
Stop it!
A fake license isn't good for much.

251
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,399
Rats!

252
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>Monster Island.</i>

253
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,964
<i>Monster Island, come in.</i>

254
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:21,390
Can I help you?
Interested in buying this car?

255
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,142
No, I was just -

256
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,853
It looks like junk, but it runs great.

257
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,147
I'll give you a good price.

258
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,940
Is it yours?

259
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,442
No, I'm just looking after it.

260
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,486
Want to take a look?

261
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,495
Maybe some other time.

262
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,997
Wait!

263
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,124
Damn Iooky-loo!

264
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,801
Ichiro, dinner's ready!

265
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,428
Coming!

266
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:09,396
What's wrong?
You haven't touched the meat.

267
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,192
- I feel bad.
- Why?

268
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,028
I'm worried you'll go broke.

269
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,406
A little beef won't break the bank!

270
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,451
Did you sell that new toy?

271
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:26,496
I might have a buyer.
I want you to be a play tester.

272
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,873
A play tester?

273
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,420
I want a kid's honest opinion.

274
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,881
So you're paying me with sukiyaki?

275
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,549
You could say that.

276
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,343
Great!

277
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,069
Hey, slow down there.

278
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,738
You'll get sleepy if you stuff yourself.

279
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,742
That reminds me.
Don't wake me up next time.

280
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,619
I'm going to see Godzilla.

281
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,496
Godzilla? Where?

282
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,791
Monster Island.
Minilla's going to take me to him.

283
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,506
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

284
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:18,966
You are...?

285
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,097
Police. We wanted
to give you a heads-up.

286
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,898
That car down there
belongs to you, right?

287
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,066
Yes.

288
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,777
It's not parked illegally, is it?

289
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,154
No, nothing like that.

290
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,908
You may have heard
about the 50-million-yen heist.

291
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,287
The robbers may try to steal a car,
so be careful.

292
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,124
Really? Thanks for telling me.

293
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,459
Sorry to bother you.

294
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,461
Let's go.

295
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,673
<i>Thief!</i>

296
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>Police!</i>

297
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,011
Good night.

298
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,357
What are we gonna do?

299
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,319
Smoking's no cure for hunger.

300
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,654
I'm starving!

301
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,783
We're loaded, right?

302
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,662
Forget about food.

303
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,498
Think about how to get out of here.

304
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,836
Did you find out where that kid lives?

305
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,338
Yeah.

306
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,090
Second floor,
third apartment from the right.

307
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,802
Good.

308
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,014
Put this away and let's go.

309
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,503
Minilla!

310
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,762
It's Gabara!

311
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,635
Finally lost him!

312
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,938
Oh, it's you.

313
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,232
What are you doing?

314
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,985
Nothing. I have no friends.

315
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,112
Then you're just like me.

316
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,865
Why did you come back?

317
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,452
You said you'd help me
climb up on Godzilla's back.

318
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,122
Oh, right.
I wonder where he is now.

319
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:41,585
- You're not with him all the time?
- No, he gets mad.

320
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,836
Why?

321
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:47,299
Godzilla says I have to learn
to fight my own battles.

322
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,302
He's tough on you, huh?

323
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,684
There he is! Come on!

324
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,070
They're fighting.

325
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,756
Go on!

326
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,674
Let him have it!

327
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,684
Get back!

328
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,520
Will Godzilla be okay underwater?

329
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,939
Yeah, he's really tough.

330
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,688
He won!

331
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,951
He's going that way.

332
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,835
Let's follow him.

333
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,852
It's Kumonga!

334
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,551
Godzilla got it in the eye!

335
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,351
We'll see about that!

336
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,209
Come back, quick!

337
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,253
Run!

338
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,677
You're still not ready for that.

339
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,304
Yeah...

340
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,390
but even Godzilla
couldn't do it at first.

341
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,768
He had to practice a lot.

342
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,442
Look! He's amazing!

343
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,082
Godzilla fell down.

344
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,487
Hooray! He won!

345
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,118
- What's wrong?
- It's Gabara!

346
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,460
What should we do?

347
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,295
You gonna fight him?

348
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,689
We should run.

349
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:22,694
If I always run,
Godzilla will think I'm a coward.

350
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,612
No, don't!

351
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,910
Here goes nothing.

352
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,394
Go, Minilla!

353
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,688
Let him have it!

354
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,864
Minilla, run!

355
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:09,991
You better run!

356
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,307
You're right. Let's run.

357
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,495
We're safe here.

358
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,500
He's scarier than the Gabara I know.

359
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,594
Fighter jets!

360
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,639
Humans are coming
to invade our island again.

361
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,555
Hooray!

362
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,400
No, I don't want to!

363
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,371
<i>I guess Minilla has to learn too.</i>

364
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,272
Attaboy, Minilla!

365
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,531
Keep still!

366
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,200
Make a sound and you'll get it!

367
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,203
See if the coast is clear.

368
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,717
Put your shoes on.

369
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,874
Ichiro!

370
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,718
What were you gonna do
with my license, kid?

371
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,138
Forget that. Go find us a car.

372
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,730
Keep quiet, you hear?

373
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,432
Shut up! Stop crying!

374
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,434
Don't be a sissy.

375
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,520
Boys get scared too.

376
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,355
Quiet!

377
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,274
Sake, please.

378
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,484
We meet again.

379
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,736
Still on the job?
They work you hard!

380
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,697
It's been a wild goose chase.

381
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,824
Recharging your batteries?

382
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,910
Can't stand the thought
of going back empty-handed.

383
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,579
We'll warm up
and then make another round.

384
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:34,125
Officer, what does
50 million yen look like?

385
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,628
It would fill a bag like this.

386
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,775
Damn it!

387
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,321
Why's it taking so long
just to steal a car!

388
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,501
<i>Fall in, bad man!</i>

389
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,840
<i>Fall in, bad man!</i>

390
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,309
- It's Minilla.
- What?

391
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,394
Minilla's in danger.

392
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,938
We're the ones in danger!

393
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,611
Minilla...

394
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:36,247
Minilla, hang in there!
Don't let him beat you!

395
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,667
That's it!

396
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,402
Minilla!

397
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,320
Up here!

398
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,823
Come up here!

399
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,202
Quick! I have an idea.

400
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,745
Quick!

401
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,757
When Gabara steps on that tree trunk,
jump on this end.

402
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,759
Can I beat him then?

403
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,177
You'll send him flying.

404
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,601
Here he comes!

405
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,398
Okay.

406
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,068
Here I go.

407
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,614
Now!

408
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,127
You did it, baby!

409
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,526
Go, Godzilla!

410
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,877
Hooray! He won!

411
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,713
Godzilla's really strong!

412
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,678
Gabara limps away
with his tail between his legs!

413
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:39,443
No, I'm your friend! Don't!

414
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,612
Minilla, help!

415
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,405
Help me!

416
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,200
You're having a bad dream, kid.

417
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,035
Wake up!

418
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,496
Pipe down!

419
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:55,292
It's me!

420
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:59,546
Idiot! What took you so long?

421
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,300
Don't blame me. The car had a flat.

422
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,054
I've never had to change a -

423
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,972
Where's the car now?

424
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,808
Just outside.

425
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,602
Give me your handkerchief.

426
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,814
You bringing the kid?

427
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,066
Kidnapping's a serious crime.

428
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,485
Not his legs! His hands!

429
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,824
We're not gonna kill him.
There's no point.

430
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,951
But if he's safe, we're safe.

431
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,994
He's our ticket to freedom, huh?

432
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,121
Shut up and get the bag.

433
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,457
Keep quiet, you hear?

434
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,418
Hurry up!

435
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,502
Quiet!

436
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,838
Hurry up!

437
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,215
Stupid piece of junk!

438
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:38,812
Hurry it up!

439
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,024
Keep quiet, you hear?

440
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,573
What's wrong?

441
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,369
- Let me handle this!
- Just get it moving.

442
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,835
<i>Godzilla says I have to learn
to fight my own battles.</i>

443
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,096
The kid!

444
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,518
Hold it right there!

445
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,023
Stop it!

446
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,318
Little brat! Hold it!

447
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,096
Be careful!

448
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,891
I've had it with that damn kid.

449
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,185
But he's trapped like a rat now.

450
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,980
Go look in that room.

451
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,277
Idiot!

452
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,745
Be careful, idiot!

453
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,916
You tripped over yourself!
Don't blame me!

454
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,127
Just go look over there.

455
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,681
Any sign of him?

456
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,141
Nope.

457
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,064
Damn it! Where'd he go?

458
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,858
It's like he vanished.

459
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,028
Go watch the entrance.

460
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,572
I'll search the second floor again.

461
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,033
Damn brat!

462
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,338
What is it?

463
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,758
- He's on the third floor.
- All right.

464
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,711
I've seen this car somewhere before.

465
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,672
Where was it?

466
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,008
Wait, this is my car!

467
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:42,055
What's my car doing here?

468
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,392
Very strange.

469
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,189
What's this? This isn't mine.

470
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,028
The robbers!

471
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:21,344
There's a big bag of cash in my car!

472
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,722
Yes, cash!

473
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,016
Huge wads of it!

474
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,436
Damn you!

475
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,771
There's nowhere to run now!

476
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:34,232
I found him!

477
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,044
What happened?

478
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,047
Where'd you go?

479
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,466
- Down here.
- Where?

480
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,885
I fell through the hole!

481
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,392
You blockhead!

482
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:23,990
Damn it!

483
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,577
It's not broken. Where's the kid?

484
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,038
- Upstairs.
- Why didn't you say so?

485
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,249
Hey, kid!

486
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,795
Stop!

487
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,922
Hold it!

488
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,597
Hold it, you brat!

489
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:00,902
Son of a bitch!

490
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,617
You little -

491
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,217
Stop it!

492
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,139
Goddamn it!

493
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:41,860
Come back, you little weasel!

494
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,325
Right here!

495
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,161
The money's right here.

496
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,917
- Mr. Shinpei!
- Ichiro!

497
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,463
Mr. Shinpei!

498
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,298
Get back!

499
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,469
Don't move or I'll shoot!

500
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,642
- Drop the knife!
- Now!

501
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,688
I'm sorry.

502
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,233
Take him away!

503
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,693
Get out here!

504
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,904
You can't run now!

505
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,073
Come out now!

506
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,871
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

507
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,831
I'm sorry.

508
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,876
Let's go.

509
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:46,049
You fought those two all by yourself?

510
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,134
I had to...

511
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,887
It's all right now.

512
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,682
Let's go home.

513
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,353
Well done, son.

514
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,565
We'll take you home.
- Thank you.

515
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,956
I'm sorry.

516
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:22,293
I'll never work again at night
no matter what.

517
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,381
But don't we need the money?

518
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,927
Of course I wish you and Dad
were home all the time,

519
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,555
but I can take care of myself.

520
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,724
I'm done.

521
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,857
Bye, Mom!

522
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,192
Bye, and be careful!

523
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,413
Here he comes!

524
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,040
Hey, sonny.

525
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,460
Weren't you scared all alone?

526
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,128
I wasn't alone.

527
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,297
Was someone with you?

528
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,299
Who was with you?

529
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,134
Minilla.

530
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,470
That's right. Gotta go!

531
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,431
Let him go.

532
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:19,225
He means Minilla the monster.

533
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,646
I think I understand.

534
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,899
He's like a higher power.

535
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,984
- A higher power?
- That's right.

536
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,653
Adults believe in gods,

537
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:35,158
so why can't kids have
their own gods too, like Minilla?

538
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,826
That's true.

539
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,953
Sachiko!

540
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,541
Did you buy
this month's manga magazine?

541
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,002
- No.
- You can read mine.

542
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,846
Ichiro, wanna join us?

543
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,014
No!

544
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,432
What?

545
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,143
You're just a bully, Gabara!

546
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,020
You little -

547
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,968
I hate bullies!

548
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:05,832
Stop that!

549
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:09,002
I said stop it! Leave that alone!

550
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,132
All right, baby!

551
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,137
You really did it!

552
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,265
He looks like a monster!

553
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,603
Damn kids!

554
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,730
Run!

555
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,149
Come back here!

556
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:32,859
Damn it!

557
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:38,281
Come back here, damn it!

558
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:46,289
Daddy!

559
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,126
Daddy!
- Ichiro!

560
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:52,795
Please apologize for me.

561
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,422
What did you do?

562
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,883
It's all my fault.

563
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,136
Come back here!
Where are your parents?

564
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,347
You did that?

565
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,223
- Thanks, Dad!
- Wait!

566
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,645
Stop, you brat!

567
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,897
I'm sorry. That's my son.

568
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:14,400
Look what he did to me!

569
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,070
I'll pay your laundry bill.

570
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,407
This paint won't come out!

571
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,493
I'm really sorry.

572
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,330
Sorry, Mr. Painter!

573
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,300
THE END

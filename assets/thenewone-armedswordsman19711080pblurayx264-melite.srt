1
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:41,582
Quick

2
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,874
Move it quickly

3
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,874
Lets' say if one of
you had Twin swords and were...

4
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,207
...confronted by this technique
what would you do?

5
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,332
Then I would surely die with pierced guts

6
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,707
Master

7
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,124
Follow me

8
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,707
Master, we were lucky to accomplish your mission

9
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,707
Brother Wang gathered the darts and hid the money

10
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,249
Have you seen Lei Li who uses the Twin swords?

11
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,040
Yes. Excels at skills with
both the long & short sword

12
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,290
In less than a year...

13
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,665
he has already made a name for himself

14
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,915
But then, his arrogance and inexperience...

15
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,749
will lead him to a trap

16
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,624
You've carried out my instructions

17
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:11,874
Yes

18
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,832
We've killed Chieftain Ho's brothers and...

19
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,124
sent the bodies back to Yuan Sing Security bureau;

20
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,457
Along with a word that while dying they said...

21
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,957
Lei Li robbed and killed them

22
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,124
Cheiftain Ho had sent Lei Li a letter...

23
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,207
and asked him to meet at the Black Forest

24
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,332
Master, once you show yourself

25
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,790
...he'll never appear in the martial arts world again!

26
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,999
Master, you are number one in the martial arts world

27
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,624
No one can match your fame

28
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,790
I am here. Yet, why the hell be so pusillanimous!

29
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,665
What is it? Speak up

30
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:01,582
Friend Lei, your skills
have rocked the martial world

31
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,665
I little expected you to turn out a robber

32
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,582
...and stoop so low

33
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,374
If you have been robbed and desire to seek my help

34
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,790
I promise I'll get the goods back for you

35
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,749
Two friends brought back our dead brother's body

36
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,665
They said our brother told him before dying...

37
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,082
that the robber used twin swords

38
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,165
So who else could it be?

39
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,915
Nonsense... I'm not responsible for the robbery

40
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,165
I suggest you go look for Cheng Giu

41
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,290
Halt!

42
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,082
I'll teach you a lesson

43
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,290
You are such a pain in the neck

44
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:56,915
Attack

45
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,582
Lei Li, you robber and plunderer. You...

46
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,999
However reckless, you can't equal my twin swords

47
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,707
Master, some people are fighting over there

48
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,832
Hero Lung

49
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,665
Well well... Chieftain Ho, what's up?

50
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,624
He... he is a robber

51
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,082
You be the judge, Hero Lung

52
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,124
You are still young

53
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,915
Why use your martial art skills

54
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,165
...to commit such vile deeds!

55
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,874
Who are you?

56
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,999
Lung Er Zi

57
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,207
Oh, so it's chivalrous Hero Lung

58
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,749
Your fame precedes you

59
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,082
That's kind of you. And your good name?

60
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,832
Lei Li

61
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,415
Your name is not new to me either

62
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,415
But you haven't been righteous

63
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,457
Considering your age I'm prepared to spare you

64
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,749
...provided you repent your ways

65
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,540
That's sheer nonsense

66
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,165
Or do you refuse to heed my warning?

67
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,249
Let's see how good your skills are

68
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,624
Well... newborn calf not
scared of the tiger, huh!

69
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,540
I'm prepared to try out some moves with you

70
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,749
If I lose, I'll cut off my right arm and...

71
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,582
retire from the martial arts world

72
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,040
I'll do the same if I lose

73
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,374
Why come to such an extreme decision?

74
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,207
You are young

75
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,332
lt'd suffice if you just amend your ways

76
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,540
Bull shit

77
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,540
I'll let you attack first

78
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,874
Who are you to decide?

79
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,707
Well... I'll make the first move then

80
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,707
Son, the more experienced the better

81
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,082
I have lost!

82
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,499
Don't attach too much importance to
winning and losing

83
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,707
Here is your knife

84
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,415
You may forget what you have promised

85
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,499
A man ought to keep his word

86
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,165
I'll cut off my arm and retreat

87
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,165
The arm shall remain here

88
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:26,290
...and be a reminder to evil-doers

89
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,749
Don't chase, let him go

90
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,915
I'll make it my responsibility to get back

91
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,207
...your money pouch

92
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,832
Chivalrous Lung, you are a true hero

93
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,540
Today, if it weren't for you...

94
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,582
I'm afraid we'd all be dead

95
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,082
Go back please, everyone

96
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,582
I'll send forth the lost money once I find it

97
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,915
Our sincere gratitude

98
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,665
You're welcome

99
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,707
Please escort chieftain

100
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,499
...and his men back

101
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,332
You two remain here
and help me trace the lost goods

102
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,957
Yes

103
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,665
We take your leave

104
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,415
So where have you both...

105
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,332
hidden the money from Yuan Sing security bureau?

106
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,582
Master

107
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,582
Chieftain Ho must announce this matter...

108
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,457
then your fame will be even greater

109
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,165
Yes, it would add to your heroism...

110
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,290
to have rid of an arch enemy

111
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,790
This Lei Li fellow;

112
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,290
A few more years in the martial arts world...

113
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,374
and his fame would have soared higher than yours

114
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,999
Where is the money hidden?

115
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,915
Master, for our hard work

116
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,290
...can we please have it?

117
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,707
No one knows about this anyway

118
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,707
Teacher, we'll do whatever errand you give us

119
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,165
You both are actually trying to coerce me!

120
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:23,874
No, we don't dare

121
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,457
Master

122
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,374
You should know

123
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,290
Last year I took your two brothers...

124
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,915
to victory against the Bai Fa Swordsman

125
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,207
How come they have never returned, huh?

126
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,707
No idea

127
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,957
You're like them

128
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,332
Master...

129
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,415
We don't dare ask for money anymore

130
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,582
The money is hidden at the Tiger Mansion, we...

131
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,290
Because you have only one arm

132
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,457
I've taken you in out of pity

133
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,249
You must speed up your work

134
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,665
Don't think because
it rains there'll be no customer

135
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,707
Go to the kitchen and have the noodles...

136
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,290
ready for serving

137
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,999
I have never come across...

138
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,624
such a silent man!

139
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,749
Lei Li, we have customers

140
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,332
A bottle of wine and a plate of beef, quick

141
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,582
On the double

142
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,999
Boss Li, turn up the lights

143
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,582
When are we going to be served?

144
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,374
You've hired a cripple

145
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,624
A lot of money you'd have saved

146
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,790
Yes

147
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,082
What the heck!

148
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,499
It's been raining heavily these days

149
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,540
Hey, people say you won't speak unless it thunders

150
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,415
Is that true?

151
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,540
If it's like that...

152
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,582
then he should transform into a tortoise

153
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,999
Damn, the table is dirty

154
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,124
Do you take us for fools?

155
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,332
Do it quickly

156
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,832
Boss Li, look

157
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,624
A cripple is useless

158
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,499
He has to remove the plates to wipe the table

159
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,207
Just do it

160
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,957
Just ask your mother to grow you one more arm

161
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,790
Please order whatever you desire

162
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,624
Although he is handicapped

163
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,832
...he is quick and diligent

164
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:46,874
Brother Lei

165
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,957
I'll do it

166
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,415
Miss, we put it on
your father's tab as before, right?

167
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,915
Sure

168
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,374
It's raining heavily, I'll accompany you

169
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,499
Okay

170
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,374
Won't you have a drink with my dad?

171
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,915
Lei Li, you're always being bullied

172
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,249
Like those thugs you also should keep...

173
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,707
a sword at the waist

174
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,707
Maybe they'd lay off then

175
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,082
Dad often remarks that...

176
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,332
you must have known kung fu before

177
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,249
Is that right?

178
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,207
Is it true?

179
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:36,374
Ba Jiao, you go carefully. I'll head back

180
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:22,290
Hero Fung

181
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,290
Who are you?

182
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,915
Oh, it's really you, we're saved

183
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,415
Everyone knows that...

184
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,915
your twin swords are matchless

185
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,957
You've detained me just because of this?

186
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,999
Oh no, we're running for our lives

187
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,082
From a distance we saw your gait

188
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,165
...so we ran up to you

189
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,874
We've really met our saviour

190
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,499
Hero Fung, we have been robbed

191
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,207
Please help us

192
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,249
Right

193
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:54,999
Where?

194
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,290
Just over there at the slope

195
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,124
We fought for our lives and escaped

196
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,999
This is a dangerous road

197
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,332
Yesterday too someone was robbed

198
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,957
It must be done by the men at Tiger Mansion

199
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,582
Yes, Tiger Mansion

200
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,540
Our money has been robbed by Chieftain Chan

201
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:29,415
Okay, I'm headed towards Tiger Mansion anyway

202
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,124
I'll remember your request

203
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,665
Many thanks

204
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,624
Hey guys!

205
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,624
They didn't say which treasury house!

206
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,207
Never mind, for sure this fellow

207
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:19,415
...will go to Tiger Mansion anyway

208
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,540
The top guys of Tiger Mansion are at the tavern

209
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,040
Let's go and have a drink

210
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,749
No, teacher has forbidden us

211
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,790
...to consort with their folk

212
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,624
Why is that? Teacher himself...

213
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:39,124
Shut up and go

214
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,665
Hero Fung will be here soon

215
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,790
We'll be in trouble if he runs into us

216
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:44,790
Let's go

217
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,707
The wine is good here

218
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,457
Hey, get us another bottle

219
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,999
Be quick

220
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,457
This kid sure has some skills

221
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,832
Yes

222
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,624
You see, a cripple has to think of alternate ways

223
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:33,999
You needn't speak on his behalf

224
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,290
How long have you been here?

225
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,415
Almost 2 years

226
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,582
You studied martial arts?

227
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:56,582
Look at me when speaking

228
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,374
Lei Li

229
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,665
Miss Ba, you want to buy wine?

230
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,707
Yes

231
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,540
Let me help you

232
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,457
Miss, he can do it pretty fast

233
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,832
...you needn't show sympathy

234
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,832
You should pity us, we're drinking alone

235
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,624
Why don't you drink with us?

236
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,790
Look, the lad objects to it

237
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,999
Where is she from?

238
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:23,415
She... she's the daughter of blacksmith Ba

239
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,582
So I see

240
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:29,290
Pretty girl, we need to have a lot of work done

241
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,540
Please ask your father to come up with you

242
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,707
...to our place

243
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,624
Good food and wine; it'd be real fun with us

244
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,665
What else would you both like?

245
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,290
Damn kid, mind your own business

246
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:16,540
Gentleman

247
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,290
Please ask the good sir to let him be

248
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:23,290
Shut up or you'll have a hard time too

249
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,124
Damn, the lady has run away

250
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,374
Now you get her back for me

251
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,165
Do you hear me?

252
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,957
Bastard, you want to be a hero

253
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,832
Be careful, he knows kung fu

254
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,290
You know kung fu? Very well

255
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,540
That's too cautious... here, watch me

256
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,957
Hear that, bastard?

257
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,707
Get the girl back

258
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,707
Didn't you hear?

259
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:46,999
Hey

260
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,332
I'm here

261
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,332
Please don't bully him anymore

262
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,165
Come, drink with us

263
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:04,707
You...

264
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:10,165
Let her go

265
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,665
Let go of her

266
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:50,999
Who are you?

267
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,540
Just a passer-by

268
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,457
You're the twin-swords hero Fung?

269
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:57,499
That's right

270
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,207
Listen, brother...

271
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:31,915
Hurry, let's go

272
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,915
Why didn't you fight back just now?

273
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,040
I don't know what you're talking about

274
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,415
Come out

275
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,457
Who were those two thugs a while back?

276
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,999
They're the top guys at Tiger Mansion

277
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:13,582
Your swordsmanship is great

278
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,415
Those two fellows...

279
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,332
could also take on many at a time

280
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,957
Who is that one-armed youth?

281
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,374
He is the helper here at Boss Li's eatery

282
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,374
Don't pretend to be a hero

283
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,665
Why don't you just let them have their way?

284
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,332
Look at you now, all beaten up!

285
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,207
I run a small place. Rather not have any trouble

286
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:46,165
Miss Ba, your dad awaits the wine

287
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,374
You go back

288
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,082
Brother Lei

289
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,290
Please go

290
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,082
I'll come again...

291
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,499
to give you something

292
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,582
My friend, you...

293
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,832
If there's something you need...

294
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,749
please let us know and I'll make it

295
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,499
People say real fighters don't show their strength;

296
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,832
But I don't understand...

297
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,707
I don't know what you're talking about!

298
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,749
Chief

299
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,707
Before Fung comes to Tiger Mansion

300
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,957
...why did you fight with him?

301
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,999
Chief, we didn't want to

302
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,915
He unexpectedly turned up, we had no choice

303
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:01,082
Look at you nincompoops!

304
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,665
Hero Fung's swordsmanship is exceptional

305
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,499
If he came charging in, I'm afraid...

306
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:13,915
Give the order to tighten security

307
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,040
Yes

308
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:19,457
Master Chan, please come in

309
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:20,749
Yes

310
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:34,540
Your men had a fight with Fung?

311
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,207
Yes

312
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,249
The two leaders of the Mansion have been wounded

313
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,582
How are their skills?

314
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,165
Reasonably good

315
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:52,332
According to them Fung's skills are excellent

316
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,665
...and out of this world

317
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:03,165
Alright, have invitations sent out...

318
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:06,207
to martial artists within a few hundred miles

319
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,707
Have them all meet at this place

320
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:11,374
Brother Lung, we must lure Fung here

321
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:14,040
...to get rid of him

322
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:18,999
It isn't advisable to leak this out

323
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:23,957
Oh, come on. I have my own ideas

324
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:27,915
Have our names on the invitation

325
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,249
Yes

326
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,582
And send one to Fung too

327
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,874
Set the date at five days from now

328
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,915
Those who serve the invitation must be highly skilled

329
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,207
Brother Lung, I still miss the point

330
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:47,874
Tiger Mansion is mysterious to the outside world

331
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:50,749
Nobody knows what we have done

332
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,790
I want Fung to come in...

333
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:58,124
and defeat him in front of everyone;

334
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:03,999
Thus forcing him out of the martial arts world

335
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,832
A superb plan indeed!

336
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,082
Dad

337
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,165
Yes dear, what is it?

338
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:45,040
I think you have something on your mind

339
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:48,582
You approached me so many times

340
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,207
...yet you won't speak up

341
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,540
Dad, don't you have a good sword hidden away?

342
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,290
You said, unless it is a great swordsman...

343
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,415
the sword's power cannot be brought forth

344
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,499
And also that it has a peerless edge

345
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,040
Yes. Why have you brought this up?

346
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:08,249
I want to give it to Lei Li

347
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,582
Give it to him for what?

348
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:14,499
He is a good man, but bullied by many

349
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,457
If he had a sword

350
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,832
...it'd perhaps be better

351
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,165
Nonsense

352
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,124
The poor fellow has lost his right arm

353
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,957
Naturally he'd be bullied

354
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,457
Know this, presently he is only pushed around

355
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,374
Say if, how good a sword he may have...

356
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:37,165
he will surely die by another's sword

357
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:43,249
He can practice swordplay though; it's better...

358
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,540
he died in a fight than be trampled upon like this

359
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,332
That's utter rubbish

360
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:51,040
Do you know how I came by that sword?

361
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:55,999
It was 20 years ago; even before you were born

362
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,582
On an evening just like this

363
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,790
A young hero barged into our place

364
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,249
He had this sword...

365
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:08,957
and a sword stuck in his guts, bleeding profusely

366
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,832
I hid the sword

367
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,374
Not until much later I found out that...

368
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:57,124
he was a famous swordsman of the time

369
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:02,665
Alas... what good did the sword do!

370
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,165
However strong one is,
there'd always be one better!

371
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,790
Keep the wind bellows going

372
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,790
Jiao dear, have you gone to bed?

373
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,540
Yes, father

374
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,207
I suggest you go...

375
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:43,332
to the town and find suitable lodging

376
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,582
What, are you turning me away?

377
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:53,082
No, it's just that our place
is not very appropriate

378
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,874
Mr. Boss

379
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,749
You're wrong there

380
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:04,249
One's body isn't even 7 ft.
Could settle down anywhere

381
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,082
Am I right?

382
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:15,624
Friends, they say wine makes the heart sadder

383
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:20,999
But better bend one's conduct
than to keep kowtowing

384
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,165
Come, drink with me

385
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,374
Sir, you are drunk

386
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,290
Only a real hero, a brave man

387
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:43,457
can transcend above everything else, like you

388
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,290
Whyever...

389
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,165
You...

390
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,082
Lei Li, don't offend customers

391
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:52,582
Lei Li? You are Lei Li?

392
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:00,540
Lei, my friend

393
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:09,040
Please don't follow me

394
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,540
Boss Li

395
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,832
Where's that chap...

396
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,415
who wounded some people here?

397
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,207
Is someone looking for me?

398
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,665
What do you want with me?

399
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,915
Fighters within 500 miles...

400
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,624
will meet at the Tiger Mansion in five days

401
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,707
Here is the invitation from Hero Lung

402
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,665
Hero Lung?

403
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,457
Yes, Hero Lung Er Zi

404
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,957
Why would he consort with the folks...

405
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,249
at the Tiger Mansion?

406
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:50,915
Tiger Mansion is famous

407
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,915
What's so strange about Hero Lung...

408
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,249
having a relationship with Chieftain Chan?

409
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:58,957
Right, I'm going up there anyway

410
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:06,832
Let's have the invitation

411
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,374
Come on, what's to fear?

412
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,957
There's a little something I want to know

413
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,665
Yes, please ask

414
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,290
Tiger Mansion is known for heroism & justice;

415
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,082
Yet discreetly indulges in unlawful activity

416
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,832
The 2 recent robberies... who all were involved?

417
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:35,790
There has been no such incident

418
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,957
Hero Fung, we're here to deliver the invitation

419
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:39,332
...with good intent. Please don't hurt us

420
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,874
Go tell Chan Chun Nam

421
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,290
I'll be there in 5 days

422
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,082
Ask him to be prepared to greet me

423
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,790
And yes, my regards to Hero Lung

424
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,457
Let's go

425
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,165
Lei Li, Lei Li

426
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:21,582
Brother Lei

427
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:23,665
See what I've got for you!

428
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:24,665
What is it?

429
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,124
A blade... a good sword

430
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,957
Tuck that sword in your waist cloth

431
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,165
Whoever wanting to bully you...

432
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,915
will have second thoughts

433
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:44,749
Thank you, but I won't use it

434
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:50,790
I... I can't, please take it back

435
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,874
You are willing to be bullied?

436
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,624
Ba Jiao, you don't understand

437
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,874
It's useless even if I carry it

438
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:19,749
I did have a sword once, I...

439
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:26,249
Kindly take it back, I don't want

440
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:30,457
No, once I've brought it I won't take it back

441
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,207
I'll leave it here. It's up to you if you want it

442
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:39,790
Ba Jiao!

443
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:49,124
Truly rare... wonder if I can ever be like him!

444
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,707
Abandoned his twin swords!

445
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,082
This girl is a tender sweetie pie

446
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,790
We both can enjoy her

447
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:07,499
You're injured more. Naturally I'd go first

448
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,582
Oh, that doesn't matter

449
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:09,582
Sure

450
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,249
Ba Jiao!

451
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,790
Lei Li, whom are you chasing?

452
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,832
Men from Tiger Mansion

453
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,040
They... they took Ba Jiao

454
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,124
Please don't cry

455
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,457
If Lei Li had not come after you...

456
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,290
you would have ended up at Tiger Mansion

457
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:54,915
Lei Li?

458
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,957
Yes

459
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,624
I think he wanted to return you the sword

460
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,415
...and saw you were abducted

461
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:07,415
Why doesn't he want the sword?

462
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,665
You may not understand

463
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:14,832
Tell me. Perhaps I would

464
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,124
He had great skills before

465
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,249
Maybe even greater than mine

466
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,957
But he was defeated...

467
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:27,540
and lost an arm

468
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,332
Now he just wishes...

469
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,915
that he'd forget he ever knew Kung Fu

470
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:36,749
Unknowingly you might have made him suffer more

471
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:39,165
...by giving him the sword

472
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,665
I see!

473
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:26,082
Brother Fung

474
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:27,790
Brother Lei

475
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:33,624
I am a helper at the tavern

476
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:38,249
I'd rather not talk about the past

477
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,082
You still treat me as your friend

478
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,749
I treat you as my brother

479
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:50,707
Brother Fung, come along

480
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,415
I'll cook something delicious for you

481
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,415
Sure

482
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:09,915
Yes, go ahead, you two... just forget about me!

483
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,999
Come, grab my sleeve

484
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:18,374
Lei Li, I have never seen you smile

485
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:44,832
Until noon, there won't be customers

486
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:45,999
I'll keep you company

487
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:49,790
Don't mind me, carry on with your work

488
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,332
Lei, the customers are waiting

489
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:24,665
Brother Lei, I admire you can do that

490
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,457
I simply envy you

491
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:31,332
Come on, quit kidding

492
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:35,999
Think I'd joke with someone of your experience?

493
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:49,124
You had better not go to this meeting...

494
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:51,832
at Tiger Mansion

495
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:57,165
I must, I think Hero Lung, too...

496
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:59,624
has been tricked by those men

497
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:04,040
I have to reveal their treachery

498
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:07,874
Hero Lung? Lung Er Zi

499
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:10,624
I shouldn't have mentioned him

500
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,374
That's fine

501
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:14,415
I lost to...

502
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,082
his three-sectioned staff

503
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:21,124
Hero Fung, there is one technique...

504
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,415
specially designed against twin swords

505
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:27,915
I lost because of this technique. This...

506
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:32,749
It's okay.
You've long stopped thinking about kung fu

507
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,915
I won't fight with him either

508
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:37,082
So why talk about such things?

509
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,707
Brother Lei, I have decided

510
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:45,124
I'll retire after this meeting

511
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,499
We'll take up farming at Tai Wu lake

512
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:53,665
What are you laughing about?

513
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:56,165
I don't know for sure if Ba Jiao...

514
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:59,499
will leave her father to go along with you

515
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:04,540
Don't give up, not everyone knows kung fu

516
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,790
Those who do might not be that much happier

517
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:11,457
Brother Fung

518
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:18,415
I haven't been happy this past year

519
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,999
I torture myself daily

520
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:27,624
Only until now I can realise in my heart...

521
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,332
that I have no more pain

522
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:08,290
Thank you for coming, we're honoured

523
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,790
- Please
- Thanks

524
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:22,957
Brother Lung

525
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:26,415
Do you think Fung will come?

526
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:29,415
He certainly will

527
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,582
I have seen too many of such young heroes

528
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:39,165
Yes, many of them...

529
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,957
have been defeated by you...

530
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,165
over the years

531
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,457
But brother Lung...

532
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,290
why do you never kill them?

533
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:57,415
That's why I'm known as Chivalrous hero Lung

534
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:01,415
Our Jin died at the hands of Fung;

535
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:05,790
You think that would make him change his mind?

536
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,832
Don't worry

537
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:13,207
He'll think I'm on his side and that I'm here...

538
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,790
to uphold the justice

539
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,874
Right there and then I'll decide what to do

540
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:40,040
I'll be back before the sun sets

541
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,874
Brother Fung, if you fight with Lung

542
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,415
...you must guard against that special technique

543
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,082
He is a famous swordsman

544
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:50,957
Why would I fight with him?

545
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,874
If he is a famous swordsman...

546
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,082
why would he be with the gang of Tiger Mansion?

547
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,582
Most likely he has been deceived

548
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,915
I'll sort it out

549
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,790
Well, I hope so too

550
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,999
Brother Fung, I'll await your return

551
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:09,790
Right on

552
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:43,332
That sword is still with me. Please take it back

553
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,540
To take it back in broad daylight...

554
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,624
would get me a good scolding from dad

555
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:49,082
It's better to leave it with you

556
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,290
Most welcome, Hero Fung

557
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:45,332
Please

558
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:15,624
Hero Fung has arrived

559
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:39,165
Your fame precedes you

560
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,124
It's an honour to meet you in person

561
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:43,040
You are Chan Chun Nan?

562
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:43,665
Yes

563
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:44,624
Where's Hero Lung?

564
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:47,249
Hero Lung and other heroes...

565
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,540
are waiting in the grand hall

566
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:57,332
Good. Don't try any moves. Let's proceed there

567
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:01,207
And you'll receive a fair hearing. Come on

568
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:07,207
Hero Lung

569
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,249
What is the matter, Chief?

570
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,332
Who is this young man?

571
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,332
This is twin swordsman, our friend Fung

572
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,040
Hero Lung

573
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:47,540
You flatter me

574
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,124
Why do you have a conflict with Chieftain Chan?

575
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,332
Hero Lung, Folks

576
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:57,665
I am afraid you've been deceived

577
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:02,749
Tiger Mansion looks innocent enough

578
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,207
But it is an evil place

579
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:09,415
Chief, is it like that?

580
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,832
You allege that hero Fung
injured or killed your men

581
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:14,999
What actually happened?

582
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:16,207
There is no such thing

583
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:19,874
But it is a fact Fung is the culprit

584
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:21,582
Fung, my friend

585
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:23,415
What have they done?

586
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,749
Robbing

587
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,290
Nonsense. What treasury house did I rob?

588
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:30,207
Exactly

589
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:33,207
Who did they rob?

590
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:36,957
One of them is Lin Shing.
About the other I'm checking

591
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:38,415
What? Lin Shing!

592
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:40,749
Is that the one in Chun Kong county?

593
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:41,499
Most probably

594
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,457
What a joke!

595
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,707
I'm the chieftain of Lin Shing Security Bureau

596
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:50,124
Wouldn't I know about robbery at my place?

597
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:52,999
Hero Lung, you'll be the judge

598
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:58,415
Fung, what about the other security bureau?

599
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:03,124
Hero Fung, I'm afraid you're grossly mistaken

600
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,082
You've injured men of Tiger Mansion...

601
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:10,915
slaughtered them and lied about the incident

602
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:13,915
If everyone with some martial art skills

603
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:15,707
...were as outrageous;

604
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,415
What will this world come to?

605
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:20,915
Oh!

606
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:24,874
So inviting me here was to teach me a lesson!

607
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,999
No, I was passing by...

608
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:31,374
and heard of the incident

609
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:34,374
And since we are all martial artists

610
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,040
I just hope to be an intermediary

611
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:39,790
You've just arrived and drew a sword at the host

612
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,332
Isn't it out of line?

613
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,040
Goodbye everyone

614
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:00,374
Hold it!

615
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,790
The so-called leader of Tiger Mansion, Jin Yi

616
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:06,874
abducted the daughter of...

617
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,040
blacksmith Ba in Ma Chao town

618
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:10,374
Hero Lung

619
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:13,582
About this why don't we
clarify with Chieftain Chan?

620
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:17,290
As per our information
two of them were going by...

621
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,665
when you suddenly appeared and killed one

622
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,290
You believe him?

623
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,790
Actually speaking I can't believe you

624
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,790
You mentioned two bureaus were robbed

625
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:29,582
but actually there has been no such case

626
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:36,457
I understand now. I totally understand, Hero Lung

627
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,624
So you are up to that

628
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:51,457
Fung, you've recklessly
harmed people with your swords

629
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:54,332
Today, in front of all of us...

630
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,707
You must right this wrong

631
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:00,582
All along it's me you wanted to pick a fight with

632
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,207
Why bother with this nonsense?

633
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,290
Hand me the weapon

634
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,249
Let's witness the power of your twin swords

635
01:13:07,458 --> 01:13:11,707
...that has made you so reckless

636
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,124
Please make way, everyone

637
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,624
If you promise to amend your ways...

638
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,249
I wouldn't necessarily want to fight you

639
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:35,374
Save this for after you win the duel

640
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,624
Watch this

641
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:45,957
This is your special technique

642
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,957
And you can't thwart it

643
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,374
If I had three swords, I could have defeated you

644
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:05,582
But with just two hands how can you handle three?

645
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:17,957
Look at you, barging in like this

646
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,915
I almost dropped the egg

647
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:24,165
Says who? Even with a number of eggs in mid-air

648
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:25,749
...I'm sure you can still catch them

649
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,707
Let me help you

650
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,332
Hero Fung should have returned by now

651
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:42,457
There you go again... you're so anxious!

652
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,249
The sun hasn't gone down yet

653
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:10,457
If you cut your arm
and retire from the martial world...

654
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,207
I'll let you out of this place

655
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,624
How many were there before me?

656
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:27,165
Hero Lung is so merciful, just do it

657
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:37,707
I... I'll kill him

658
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:42,832
Chieftain Chan, the matter is out of my hands

659
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,207
The quarrel between you both...

660
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,624
shall be dealt with by yourselves

661
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:48,874
Sure

662
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:53,790
Relax, he's been seriously wounded

663
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:40,374
Everyone, little did we expect this to happen

664
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,499
...and disturb you all

665
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,749
This is not Hero Lung's responsibility

666
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,999
He had already let him go

667
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:48,874
It was his own fault

668
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,874
He sought his own death

669
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:57,624
But it could be said he died at my hands

670
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:02,874
Chieftain Chan, give him a proper burial

671
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:04,332
Yes

672
01:19:04,666 --> 01:19:06,124
Please go back, gentlemen

673
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:11,165
My mood is spoilt. I just want to rest a few days

674
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,165
Yes

675
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:07,540
Lei Li, that twin-swords lad is great

676
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:12,040
In case if he had a mishap...

677
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:15,207
what's the use of worrying for him

678
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:29,457
Go and do your work

679
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:40,540
Teacher is great

680
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,457
Not only he had the kid buried appropriately

681
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,082
...but also wept at his grave

682
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,707
They all say our Master is such a hero

683
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,582
...and stands tall among men

684
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,457
This is real kung fu

685
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,499
Hey, bring the wine

686
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,832
C'mon, be quick. Stop dreaming

687
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:01,999
Who are you talking about?

688
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,624
What rubbish! That's none of your concern

689
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:09,874
I ask who are you talking about?

690
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:17,832
Speak

691
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:20,915
It's... about twin-sword Hero Fung

692
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,790
What about him?

693
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,374
He's dead and buried behind Tiger Mansion

694
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:36,999
This chap has gone nuts

695
01:21:37,708 --> 01:21:40,957
That Fung is a good friend of his

696
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:06,665
Lei, you are here

697
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:20,124
Boss Li told me... he said Fung is dead

698
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:26,624
Why do good men die easily?

699
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:36,957
Lei Li, speak something

700
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,707
I'll avenge him

701
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:01,457
How can you...

702
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:05,499
I have to avenge him

703
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:11,665
Don't go, please

704
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,665
I must avenge him

705
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:11,457
Hurry, run!

706
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:15,582
Where is hero Fung buried?

707
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:16,415
Take me there

708
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:17,790
Over there

709
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:00,499
Attack

710
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,249
Quick... come on, move

711
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:06,749
Chieftain

712
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:08,332
What's happening out there?

713
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:09,790
Someone has stormed the place

714
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,332
...and killed three leaders

715
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,207
Who is it?

716
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,124
Don't know

717
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,707
Who are you?

718
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:55,999
You go and check what's happening!

719
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:57,249
Yes

720
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:25,124
Such swift swordsmanship!

721
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:12,790
It's him

722
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,499
Lung Er Zi

723
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:39,624
Lei Li

724
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:27,582
You've lost your arm, know your place

725
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:30,999
After that incident I've been humble & law-abiding

726
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:34,999
But you killed hero Fung; I'm here for revenge

727
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,749
Revenge?

728
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:42,707
What capability do you have?

729
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,874
Even when you were famous for your twin swords

730
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:48,540
...you lost to me

731
01:32:48,791 --> 01:32:52,624
How will you avenge him today?

732
01:32:57,416 --> 01:32:59,665
You are rather here to die with him

733
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:02,040
...and not avenge him

734
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:09,290
I... I'm here to accompany him in death

735
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,374
Meet your death now

736
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:08,665
If I had 3 swords I could defeat you

737
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:14,040
Fung wielded twin swords with both hands

738
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,290
But you could manage three with just one arm!

739
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:28,665
It's your turn to retire from
the martial arts world

740
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:34,665
Lei Lis

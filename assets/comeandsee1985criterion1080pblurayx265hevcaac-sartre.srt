3
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,757
Hey! Are you crazy?

4
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,136
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,349
Playing a game?

6
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,354
Who are you playing with?

7
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,816
Who?

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,152
Digging?

9
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,240
Digging again?

10
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,204
Well, go on digging, you little bastards!

11
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,249
Stinking brats!

12
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,420
Hiding, eh?

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,009
Can't hide from them now.

14
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:38,682
They'll find you no matter what.
No stone unturned.

15
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,812
Come out! You hear that?

16
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,066
Come out! Now!

17
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,238
Do you hear me?

18
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,661
"Sit tight. Stay out of sight.

19
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,914
Use your finger to clean your shite."

20
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:09,671
Think you've found your wretch?
I'm not simply some dumb clown.

21
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:13,425
Now I'm German, I won't back down!

22
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,510
Very well, then!

23
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,139
Better do as I say
or I'll see that you pay!

24
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,852
Gee up!

25
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:31,777
Holed up here? Hiding out. Gutless rat.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,529
Pioneer brat.

27
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:40,160
Spineless, stinking scum.
You think it's funny?

28
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,245
I'll give you something to laugh about.

29
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,122
That's it! Now, you're done for.

30
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:50,712
Do as I say. Get used to it.

31
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:55,509
Back to work, you worthless dog!

00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:05,602
BELORUSSIA, 1943

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,667
Come on!

34
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,545
Can't join the partisans without a gun.

35
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,989
Pull!

36
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,575
The dead don't give a damn.

37
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,040
<i>"Gott mit uns."</i>

38
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,505
Not a damn thing here! That's it.

39
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,218
Where do you think I got my gun?
Think I bought it?

40
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,181
I'm doing this for you.
I've got one already.

41
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,891
Hello!

42
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,518
Hello! Berlin?

43
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:40,423
Well? Too much for you?

44
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,250
Didn't I tell you?

45
00:06:54,331 --> 00:07:00,962

56
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,771
My boy.

57
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,195
My son.

58
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,411
How will you ever look
your father in the eye?

59
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,666
What if he finds no one here?

60
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,298
Think of yourself, son.

61
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,636
Pity them, at least, if not me.

62
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,347
Son...

63
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,059
for the Lord's sake.

64
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,732
Have you no heart?

65
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:31,613
What do you want, Ma?
Everybody's going. I must go.

66
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,960
- Here.
- What is this?

67
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,212
Kill us.

68
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,256
Better kill us yourself
and be done with it.

69
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,720
Them too! All of us!

70
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,172
I won't let you go! I won't!

71
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,288
Mama! Mama!

72
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,467
Good day.

73
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,303
To be more exact, good morning.

74
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,142
So... where's the gun?

75
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,771
- Where's the gun?
- Just a minute.

76
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,232
Just a minute...

77
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,786
Oh, look at you.

78
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,415
Are they twins?

79
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,083
Identical.

80
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,712
From the same litter.

81
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,676
It's getting light.

82
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,766
- Time to begin.
- Not yet.

83
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,810
Once the cows are out, we'll begin.

84
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,314
- We need an audience.
- Take these...

85
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,733
to keep your feet warm.

86
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,695
- We'll keep him warm.
- Nothing to worry about.

87
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,906
Our camp is quite safe.

88
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,909
Just like a summer camp.

89
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,164
Would you like some milk, boys?

90
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,766
Have you got anything stronger?

91
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,063
If I had known...

92
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:56,484
I assure you, we seldom drink.
Only on holidays.

93
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,237
And at wakes.

94
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,036
We're disciplined.
Commander's in the regular army.

95
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,288
Kosach?

96
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,915
Yes, Kosach is strict.

97
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,668
If you get too close, he'll back away.

98
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,379
And chase you down if you don't stay.

99
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,674
- Remember Bobok?
- What Bobok?

100
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,426
That one-eared guy.

101
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,304
He fell asleep at his post.

102
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,808
- Kosach didn't even wake him.
- Well, so what?

103
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,020
Does it matter now?

104
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,867
Funny?

105
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,040
- Mama...
- Shh, quiet now.

106
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,461
Women here like to sleep in, eh?
Take a seat.

107
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,379
It's too risky to sit around.

108
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,050
Any moment they'll come,
and we'll be done for.

109
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,139
I once sat around. Now I can't sit at all.

110
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,811
A hunk of shrapnel the size of my fist.

111
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,732
Don't laugh. It hit me just here.

112
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,692
Where are the cows?

113
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,986
One shot and they'd wake up fast.

114
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,488
Oh, Lord.

115
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,617
Lead out the cows!

116
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,078
Right. Let's go.

117
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,457
Why are you taking him away?

118
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,209
Breathe deep, boy.

119
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,089
Lead them out, milked or not!

120
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,049
Where are you taking him?

121
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,843
Such a quiet, kind boy.

122
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:51,974
Never harmed anybody.
He's never done anything wrong.

123
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,728
Kind people, he's such a harmless boy!

124
00:14:55,812 --> 00:15:01,067
- What's wrong with you!
- Hands off!

125
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,869
Let's see him off. Let's go.

126
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,372
Hold the bird. Don't move.

127
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,290
Go back!

128
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,667
Forward!

129
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,515
Step back.

130
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,686
Step aside, I said!

131
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:44,068
Yustin, our village elder. He's an idiot.

132
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,447
I don't understand.

133
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,534
Flyora, my son!

134
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,495
My little boy!

135
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,546
My little boy!

136
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,694
Good day.

137
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,606
Good day.

138
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,734
Keep on going, boy.

139
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,070
You're skinning me alive!

140
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,288
What are you doing to me?
I'm still breathing!

141
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,841
Water, nurse...

142
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,557
Hello.

143
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,105
Keep moving.

144
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,196
- Good day.
- Hi.

145
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,414
Who's next? I'm after you!

146
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,583
This seat is taken.

147
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,095
Oh, shut up!

148
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,936
Move closer.

149
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,690
Look straight into the camera.

150
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,150
Yes, you!

151
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,989
What a face you have!
Just look at that face, comrades.

152
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,908
What a suit!

153
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,660
Come here.

154
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,746
You lie here.

155
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,085
Just so. Keep the suit on.

156
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,338
Like this.

157
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,256
No. Like this.

158
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,217
Bring in the cow!

159
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,138
EAT ME BEFORE THE GERMANS DO

160
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,974
Make room for her.

161
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,730
- We're wasting time. Get on with it!
- Keep calm.

162
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,942
Only one sheet left.
I'm using it for the third time.

163
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,611
So...

164
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,406
The chief is here.

165
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,495
Quiet. Don't move.

166
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,206
Look at the guy in the new suit.

167
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,707
Lying perfectly still.

168
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,044
Let's swap.
I took mine off a living soldier.

169
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,007
Here's our sergeant-major.

170
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,688
Will we get a copy?

171
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:53,984
<i>Rise up, great country</i>

172
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,948
<i>Rise up for a fight to the death</i>

173
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:05,454
<i>Against the dark fascist forces</i>

174
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>Against the cursed hordes</i>

175
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:17,341
<i>Let noble wrath</i>

176
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:22,930
<i>Boil over like a wave!</i>

177
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:28,477
<i>This is the peoples' war</i>

178
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:34,191
<i>A sacred war!</i>

179
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,212
Who goes there?

180
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,759
Give the password.

181
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,637
The password!

182
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,277
- New recruit?
- Yes.

183
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,364
- Your name?
- Gaishun. Platoon 3.

184
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,618
- Why didn't you shoot?
- I recognized you, Commander.

185
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,582
If a person doesn't stop
or give the password, shoot!

186
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,126
- But I...
- Doesn't matter.

187
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,213
Take on extra duty.

188
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,424
Yes, sir.

189
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,070
- Where is he?
- Who? Password!

190
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,824
- Which way did he go?
- Give me the password!

191
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,158
Idiot.

192
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,007
That owl, again.

193
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,930
Go and sleep. We'll take over.

194
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,520
<i>...In all conditions,
under the enemy's nose,</i>

195
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:39,483
<i>at risk of a Nazi attack, night and day,</i>

196
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,945
<i>they carry out their duty.</i>

197
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:51,161
<i>From June 22,
to this very day of the war...</i>

198
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>And yesterday he sent me</i>

199
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:54,141
<i>Two very puzzling letters</i>

200
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,646
<i>He left them completely blank</i>

201
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:03,233
<i>As if to hint, "Need I say more?"</i>

202
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:09,073
<i>And who knows now what he meant to say?</i>

203
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,332
Come here, Ivan.

204
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,050
I won't hide it from you.

205
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,387
This is a difficult time.

206
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:37,977
The older partisans here know
what a siege is.

207
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,981
Hitler is waging a total war against us.

208
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,609
A war to wipe us all out.

209
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:50,364
To the last man, we must hold

210
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,743
the positions we have been
ordered to defend.

211
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,331
It's a tough situation.

212
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,625
A changing situation too.

213
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,254
So look sharp!

214
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,843
You've each got a rifle
and a head on your shoulders.

215
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,221
As our commander in chief says,

216
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:19,059
"Just keep my head down?
Ha! I'm not that kind of man!"

217
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,023
I have always said

218
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:29,486
that a partisan doesn't ask
how many fascists we face.

219
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,866
He asks, "Where are they?"

220
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:39,997
And they are still here... on our land.

221
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:47,504
The duration of this war

222
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,591
depends on each and every one...

223
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,052
of us.

224
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,556
There won't be any cowards here.

225
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,061
Not one.

226
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,732
Hitler's greatest weapon is our fear.

227
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,110
He will turn you into slaves...

228
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,115
into insects... to be crushed!

229
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,578
But we'll make them tremble.

230
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,247
We'll be ruthless.

231
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,125
That's what they deserve.

232
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,963
Every one of us will be asked,
"What did you do here?"

233
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:33,801
Anybody injured?

234
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,305
Anybody unable to march?

235
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,767
Don't be shy.

236
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,480
We will leave men behind anyway
to set up a reserve camp.

237
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,900
-Nobody's injured. Everybody can march.

238
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,779
- But I want to say...
- What is it?

239
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,990
My boots are falling apart.

240
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,039
Take the new recruit's boots.
He'll stay behind.

241
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,672
Form ranks, four abreast!

242
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,049
Forward march!

243
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,761
Look lively, men!

244
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,723
Come on. You heard the commander.

245
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,100
Get down.

246
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,406
Keep in step!

247
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,200
Don't fall behind!

248
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,551
And what do they call you?

249
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,845
Flyora.

250
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,472
Is that your name?

251
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,933
It's Flyora. Flyora.

252
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,643
And you?

253
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,106
Rosie. Rosie with pockets full of posies.

254
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,317
Ever heard of me?

255
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,403
How did you come to be here?

256
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,948
Sent me to Germany, ended up here.

257
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,451
Kosach rescued you?

258
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:16,333
Hey, who did you come
all dressed up for then?

259
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,881
What do you mean?

260
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,928
Today, when we were lined up. Really, why?

261
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,222
Rosie?

262
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,611
My name is Glasha.

263
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,197
Glafira.

264
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,159
Got it, silly boy?

265
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,577
What do you mean?

266
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,289
And what about you, Flyora?

267
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,628
What are you doing here?

268
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,051
They took pity on the little boy.
They left you behind.

269
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,847
Kosach felt sorry for you.

270
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,976
- For me?
- Yes, he pitied you.

271
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,937
I dare anybody here to feel sorry for me.

272
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,484
Kosach feels pity. Sometimes.

273
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,157
But afterwards he has nightmares.

274
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,742
Kosach? Nightmares?

275
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,995
He will be killed.

276
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,206
I feel it.

277
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,208
It's all a lie!

278
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,878
You're lying!

279
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,675
You're lying!

280
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,202
Why don't you say something?

281
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,917
Why don't you see me?

282
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,087
I'm right here.

283
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,426
I exist.

284
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,680
Here I am.

285
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,852
It's you. You're not alive.

286
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,898
You don't hear the birds.

287
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,777
You're deaf.

288
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,363
Blind.

289
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,201
Here I am.

290
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,287
Here.

291
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,502
I want to love.

292
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,880
I want children.

293
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,050
Do you hear?

294
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,055
I would do anything...

295
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,309
anything for you.

296
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,440
Just say the word and I'll blow myself up.

297
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,485
No, don't.

298
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:48,587
Idiot! You're crazy!

299
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:55,677
I have... 60 cartridges,
a rifle and a hand grenade.

300
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,974
I came here to fight.
You think I'm some half-wit.

301
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,768
Stop talking about Kosach.

302
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,520
Have you lost your mind?

303
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,654
What is this?

304
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,450
What's with you?

305
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:27,459
You're just too good.
You're a real "flora."

306
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,423
- Hurt your feelings, kid?
- At it again?

307
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,551
Don't be angry.

308
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,597
Cut it out!

309
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,602
What's that?

310
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,355
Beavers.

311
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,066
Maybe I disturbed their dam.

312
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,613
Seems everyone is crying out today.

313
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,455
Look.

314
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,504
In the air already. Hanging over us.

315
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,550
- Want me to shoot him?
- Give me back the gun.

316
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,272
- Give it back!
- No way.

317
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:40,073
One... two... three...

318
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,349
Glasha...

319
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,939
Glasha!

320
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,735
Glasha!

321
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,435
Come on. Quickly!

322
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,523
Oh, God...

323
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,053
Glasha. Glasha!

324
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,351
My ma will be so glad.

325
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:05,982
When we're back, I'll hide you all.

326
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,360
I know just where to go.

327
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,242
You'll like my sisters.

328
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,249
Then we'll rejoin Kosach.

329
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,989
Wait here.

330
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,716
Mama!

331
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,789
They went away. Come in.

332
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,036
They're gone.

333
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,254
It's still warm.

334
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,397
Try some. My ma cooked it.

335
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,695
Go on.

336
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,869
I know where to find them. Let's go!

337
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,623
What an idiot!

338
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,170
Come on.

339
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,382
It's not far away.

340
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,289
Come on, let's go.

341
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,959
It's close. Come on!

342
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,109
They're here.

343
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,906
On the island.

344
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,409
They must be here!

345
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,872
Come on!

346
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,806
Glasha!

347
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:32,412
They're back there! They aren't here!

348
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,248
They're gone.

349
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,084
They're dead.

350
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:42,214
Dead! They're all dead!

351
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:47,427
They're here! Here!

352
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,523
They're here!

353
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,986
Glasha!

354
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,329
Glasha!

355
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,520
What happened?

356
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,440
His family was killed.

357
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,693
He dragged me into the bog.

358
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,570
He's deaf.

359
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,156
He's crazy.

360
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:35,619
Crazy! Deaf!

361
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:40,415
He dragged me into the bog.

362
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,556
They are all dead!

363
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,019
They are all dead! Dead!

364
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:47,107
Oh, Flyora! They killed your folks.

365
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,957
Didn't I warn you?

366
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,711
Didn't I tell you?

367
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:55,133
"Don't do this, don't dig."

368
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,891
They got us all.

369
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:08,855
Every single person...

370
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,612
They covered me with petrol.

371
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,448
I was burning.

372
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:26,832
I ran after them.

373
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,296
I begged them...

374
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,593
"Pray, kill me."

375
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,680
They laughed.

376
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,642
They laughed.

377
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:53,650
I told you, didn't I? "Don't dig."

378
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,967
Flyora!

379
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,928
- Well?
- Get rid of the nose.

380
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,222
He's got syphilis.

381
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,267
- He's feeble. Diseased.
- Impotent.

382
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:36,062
It was torn off in the First World War.

383
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,232
What would you do to him
if you caught him?

384
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,943
We caught a horse thief once.

385
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:45,363
We pulled off his pants
and sat him on an ant hill.

386
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:51,036
Should have sat him
on a hot frying pan so it stuck.

387
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,955
The women would know what to do to him.

388
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:05,050
- Should I give him ears?
- Go on.

389
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,844
Let him hear what folks say about him.

390
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,516
Your hair is so soft.

391
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,353
As soft as a child's.

392
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:04,359
Now he's ready.

393
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,237
- What do you say?
- Cover him in shit.

394
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,614
Ain't got enough. We are too poor.

395
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,659
- Make his tongue stick out.
- Give him a wart.

396
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:16,830
I know what I'm doing.
I've done this before.

397
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:20,333
- So, what do you think?
- He's ready!

398
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,919
Wait till you hear him roar. Let's go!

399
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,339
Scum.

400
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:51,239
Don't worry. You'll get it back
when we return from our mission.

401
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:56,035
He's no weakling. He's pretty strong.

402
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:59,205
Come along then. Earn your keep.

403
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:03,001
I know a storehouse nearby.
There'll be food. Get up.

404
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,419
Get up!

405
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,839
Dear boys, don't abandon us!

406
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,468
Come on, we're not
skipping out on alimony here!

407
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,054
What can we bring you this time?

408
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,265
- Place your orders.
- Some bread.

409
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:22,687
- Salt too.
- Milk, please, mister!

410
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,897
Potatoes.

411
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,901
Get bread this time, whatever it takes.

412
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:34,032
You didn't know that would happen.
You couldn't have.

413
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,702
Flyora, look at me.

414
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,415
Tell Flyora we'll be waiting for him.

415
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:46,544
No, it's my fault. Mine.

416
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:13,154
"Look how round I am, how bright I am.

417
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:17,617
Anybody could spot you fools,
a kilometer away."

418
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,704
Don't jinx us.

419
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:27,168
Faster. This isn't some damn picnic.

420
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:30,547
Why did I insist on carrying this?
What an idiot.

421
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:12,398
Well, did Hitler run off
with your storehouse?

422
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:17,278
Oh, your poor legs!
And nobody helping you...

423
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,864
Who could have known
they'd be there already?

424
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,829
We went for wool,
but we ended up being shorn.

425
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:31,000
"Serves you right, you imbeciles.
Thought you'd help yourselves?

426
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,044
Now you have nothing."

427
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,547
Why carry that lunatic around?

428
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:40,385
The Germans chased us
so they could take him away.

429
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,097
But for him, we would never have met.

430
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,183
You'd be stuck in Babruysk,
in your lamp-oil store.

431
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:50,520
And Gleb would have stayed
in his swampy Leningrad.

432
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:56,192
Hear about that man in Slutsk
who made home brew out of soap?

433
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,069
Why are you so happy?

434
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:00,947
A hunchback might say,

435
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,284
"Better bent double
than always in trouble."

436
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:09,122
- The incurable optimist, Rubezh.
- We'll have to cure you!

437
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,750
Why cry about it?
There's plenty who weep as it is.

438
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:55,293
For his ma, it must have been grim
to know she had a son like him.

439
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,961
Loadit

440
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,213
He's going to roar like thunder.

441
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:03,384
Hurry! Come on!

442
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,179
His belly's already fit to burst.

443
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,931
Don't tickle him.
He'll blow Europe to bits.

444
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:12,185
The old devil doesn't
seem like much, does he?

445
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,394
Let's go.

446
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,313
It'll be a show when he goes off!

447
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,689
Okay, let's go.

448
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,679
Couldn't you drop some tobacco
to wrap the paper round?

449
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,571
"Slam the Bolshevik Yids!

450
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,449
Make them pay for what they did."

451
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:12,370
Is that all?

452
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:17,542
It's not much.

453
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:21,504
Hey.

454
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:24,507
Yids!

455
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:29,136
Get up. March on.

456
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:36,435
Well? Let's try again?

457
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:42,316
What does Rubezh say?
"Listen to me and you'll be sorry."

458
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,070
Let's go.

459
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,158
Why not wait until dark?

460
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,913
And let folks starve while we wait here?

461
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:09,760
Keep moving.
The Germans need a clear road.

462
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:14,015
Goddamn it.

463
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,434
Come on, you.

464
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:19,729
Wrong way!

465
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:08,629
"Well, here I am. It's been a while.

466
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,715
Must be missing me.

467
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:15,052
I'll just fly by overhead
and drop a few presents.

468
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,431
Want a motorbike? With a Sidecar?

469
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,809
Long time since you drove one."

470
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,687
Get down!

471
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:47,126
They get drunk up there,
and we return the empties!

472
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,626
Stand still, mister. You can finish later.

473
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:16,382
Who... Who's that? Who's there?

474
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:20,302
- Be quiet. Who are you? Polizei?
- And who are you?

475
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:22,847
Button up. You'll catch cold.

476
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:28,477
- Is this Kamenka?
- No. It's Bagushovka.

477
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,939
The Germans came two days ago.

478
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,151
- Cowshed not locked?
- No.

479
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:38,571
Bring your cow and we'll set out.

480
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:41,282
Understand, old man? And no tricks.

481
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:43,701
Afterwards you can go back.

482
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,328
Do it quick and neat.

483
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:50,457
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, as you say.

484
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,793
So obedient. You sleeping, Flyora?

485
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:57,673
You need to oil those creaking hinges.

486
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:04,680
The Germans didn't shoot the dogs?
What a mess.

487
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,894
You're white, the cow's white.
We need some camouflage.

488
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:12,521
- I'll go get something.
- A rifle?

489
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:15,191
Try that trick of yours on someone else.

490
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:18,068
It won't work on us. Got it?

491
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,404
There's horse manure. Roll in it!

492
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:27,453
Good. What's your rank?

493
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:32,833
There are no ranks in the Home Defense.

494
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:38,631
Quick, let's go,
before your wife gets lonely.

495
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:44,720
Come on, you! Get going!

496
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,063
Stop looking round. You'll fall!

497
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,575
Lie down!

498
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,748
Now go back. Go.

499
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:20,256
Back home, understand?

500
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,633
Don't say a word.

501
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,262
Off you go, then.

502
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:31,141
Run. Or your wife will be angry.

503
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,512
- I wonder where he is now?
- He never saw us coming!

504
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:12,224
He had a fine pair of boots.
Box-calf leather.

505
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:17,771
Maybe he's looking for us,
to swap boots with me.

506
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:23,360
Good cow, sweet cow, hold still.

507
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:26,780
Hold still.

508
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:31,994
Good cow, hold on.

509
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:35,247
Come on, come on!

510
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:53,057
You could get drunk on this. What a life!

511
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:58,288
Uncle Rubezh. Uncle Rubezh...

512
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,489
Gee up! Get going.

513
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,533
- Go!
- Hey!

514
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:55,997
What are you doing?

515
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,125
What the hell are you doing?

516
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:02,045
I don't have time to talk to you.

517
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:06,216
Got an ax? I've got a cow to cut up.

518
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:10,053
You can't take my horse.

519
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:16,977
- Folks are dying of hunger.
- And we're not?

520
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,522
They're out there fighting
while you're sitting at home.

521
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,107
Keep sitting then.

522
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,074
Look at what they did.

523
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,125
- You see?
- Be quiet, boy.

524
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,501
Quiet!

525
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,360
Out of your mind?

526
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:10,572
Over here! Everything down here.

527
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:18,288
Hide the belt, the jacket... everything.

528
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,833
Quick!

529
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,022
Oh, my God...

530
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:47,025
- What's this place called?
- Perekhody.

531
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:51,196
- I know families from here.
- There are many. You're one now.

532
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,739
- Got it?
- Yes.

533
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,201
A young fella here drowned.

534
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,662
- You'll take his name.
- What is it?

535
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:02,749
You have a mother, sisters and brothers.

536
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,751
Seven of them.

537
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:10,131
Olga, Katya, Fedya and little Sonya.
Got it?

538
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:14,094
Your mother's name is Fekla.

539
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:15,887
Fekla Perekhod.

540
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:19,766
And your name is Zhenya. Got it?

541
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,142
Let's get out of here.

542
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:39,763
I INSULTED A GERMAN SOLDIER
THIS MORNING

543
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,817
- And where is my "father"?
- Father?

544
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,986
Say... You'll say he's missing.

545
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,237
Missing where?

546
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:58,406
Where? Well...

547
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:01,493
Damn. Better come with me.

548
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,870
You'll be my grandson Mitrofan. Got it?

549
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:34,294
Here are my kin -
my daughter-in-law Aksinya.

550
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,965
My sister and her children.

551
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:42,343
- Who is he?
- My son-in-law. He's Kazik, a bookkeeper.

552
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,972
My sister's children -

553
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:51,853
Lima, Raya, Zoya,
Vika, Veronica and Boris.

554
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:55,523
Get out. Park together.

555
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,817
Search the houses!

556
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:02,614
- We're here too.
- These are our neighbors.

557
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,741
Maria and her children -

558
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:08,620
Lusya, Frosya, Fenya and Ivan.

559
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:12,457
It's obvious.
They'll send more of us to Germany.

560
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,168
Who are they going to take? You?

561
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:19,672
Go inside. I'll handle this.

562
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:24,886
Keep a lookout.

563
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,528
Quiet now.

564
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,334
Do you speak German?

565
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:00,505
Me? Yes.

566
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,550
Do you also speak German?

567
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,725
- Thanks.
- Sit down, please.

568
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,404
You're very welcome.

569
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:35,081
Help yourself, sir.

570
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:39,210
What's this here?

571
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,718
Ah, a partisan!

572
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,691
There are partisans among them.

573
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:24,380
Drinking alone?

574
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:28,634
Pour me some!

575
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:32,055
Some schnapps.

576
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:37,977
People of the village of Perekhody!

577
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:42,440
People of the village of Perekhody!

578
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:45,818
Every inhabitant!

579
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:50,573
Listen carefully. Listen carefully.

580
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:55,578
Bring your children and your documents,

581
01:37:55,661 --> 01:38:00,416
and gather in the square
at the designated location.

582
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:06,255
There will be a check
of the lists of families...

583
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:14,305
and of whether you have observed
the orders of the German State.

584
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:18,101
You must provide documentation

585
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:23,773
of farm produce deliveries.

586
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:26,692
There will be a routine inspection.

587
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:30,780
Do not remain inside your houses.

588
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:35,660
Or hide in the shed or the cellar,
on the roof or in the loft...

589
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,371
HITLER THE LIBERATOR

590
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,258
Run!

591
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,385
Save yourselves!

592
01:38:52,969 --> 01:38:58,057
Where are you rushing to?
They'll kill everybody!

593
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:04,397
What are you staring at?
Stop staring, you rat!

594
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,483
I'll kill this one!

595
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:18,453
Take supplies with you for two days.
Bring your children.

596
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:22,123
Don't leave your children behind...

597
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:31,883
Come here, you brat.

598
01:39:33,426 --> 01:39:37,221
Observe appropriate order and discipline.

599
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:46,147
Hurry! Hurry!

600
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:10,338
<i>Germany is a civilized country.</i>

601
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:14,842
<i>All those going to Germany</i>

602
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:21,098
<i>should take along
a toothbrush, toothpaste,</i>

603
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:23,726
<i>shoe polish, soap,</i>

604
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:27,230
<i>and a towel
for every member of the family.</i>

605
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:32,193
<i>No fruit or vegetables are allowed</i>

606
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:37,448
<i>in order to contain the risk
of contamination in Europe.</i>

607
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:57,635
As a medical troop NCO,

608
01:40:57,718 --> 01:41:02,265
I declare that the cause of death

609
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:07,728
was the seven bullets

610
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:09,814
in the upper half of the chest.

611
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:14,110
Anyone who refuses to carry out

612
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:19,615
the orders of the German command

613
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:24,203
can expect the same fate.

614
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:30,626
All in order, Herr Major!

615
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:34,338
We're ready, sir.

616
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,841
Will you give the signal?

617
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:44,640
Are we inviting them in, or what?
Will there be a signal?

618
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,029
Oh, goddamn it!

619
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:09,040
Well, come on in.

620
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:13,122
We caught a Yid!

621
01:44:15,958 --> 01:44:20,087
Got you! Thought you could get away, eh?

622
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:27,094
Jew bastard! Force him in!

623
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:59,919
Let me go! Bastards! I'm with you!

624
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,228
Quiet!

625
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:22,233
I declare the meeting open.

626
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:26,654
Who wants the floor?

627
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,876
My little boy!

628
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:44,296
Fascists!

629
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:46,549
What can you see?

630
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:31,010
Quiet!

631
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:39,894
Leave the kids and you're free.

632
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:43,147
Come out here.

633
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:45,357
Through the window.

634
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:49,236
Leave the kids behind.

635
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,032
Quickly, please.

636
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:12,384
Beasts! Beasts!

637
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:14,553
Let us go!

638
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:37,261
Did you hear?
He took over command of the division.

639
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,638
Great news, don't you think?

640
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:49,231
Let me go!

641
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:56,280
Pretty as a picture!

642
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,908
I'll kill you!

643
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:03,597
To the right.

644
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:48,851
Look! It's empty!

645
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:54,731
We ought to get rid of you bureaucrats!

646
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:57,192
Intellectuals!

647
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,486
Intellectuals!

648
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,868
More petrol. Let it soak through.

649
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,386
Fire!

650
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:23,477
Round up the cattle!

651
01:56:24,686 --> 01:56:26,188
You there!

652
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:29,149
Come on! March!

653
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:34,571
Here, you bastard!

654
01:58:40,989 --> 01:58:44,618
Petro, I found honey. Want some?

655
02:00:20,672 --> 02:00:23,383
We'll leave you out here for breeding.

656
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:28,304
Go on, granny, produce lots of kids!

657
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,508
<i>Yuma...</i>

658
02:05:17,802 --> 02:05:19,429
To bear children...

659
02:06:54,857 --> 02:06:58,361
Let me through!

660
02:06:58,444 --> 02:07:00,113
Stand back!

661
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,079
Stop!

662
02:07:09,247 --> 02:07:14,293
What are you thinking? These...

663
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:17,296
You want to kill them?

664
02:07:19,132 --> 02:07:20,550
Just simply kill them, and that's it?

665
02:07:20,633 --> 02:07:24,929
It was the 88. They lit the fire. Not us.

666
02:07:25,012 --> 02:07:28,099
- Sit still!
- They forced us to do it.

667
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:35,648
Scum! My children were in that fire!

668
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,451
Rank?

669
02:07:49,078 --> 02:07:50,496
Unit?

670
02:07:53,374 --> 02:07:58,087
Major Walter Stein of the SD,
15th Einsatzkommando.

671
02:07:58,171 --> 02:08:01,215
The fuhrer gave the orders.

672
02:08:09,974 --> 02:08:13,019
He's an elderly man and unwell.

673
02:08:17,732 --> 02:08:20,151
He never hurt anybody.

674
02:08:25,781 --> 02:08:31,871
He, his family, his father
have always upheld certain principles.

675
02:08:37,919 --> 02:08:43,758
He bore no hard feelings
against your people...

676
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:57,730
He... He's never killed anybody.

677
02:08:57,813 --> 02:09:00,274
He's never even hurt a fly.

678
02:09:05,112 --> 02:09:09,700
Anybody here can confirm that.
He's certain they will.

679
02:09:18,876 --> 02:09:21,796
He really is an ill, elderly man.

680
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:23,839
I just want peace now.

681
02:09:26,634 --> 02:09:28,094
That's what he says.

682
02:09:34,475 --> 02:09:36,644
He wants to care for his family.

683
02:09:36,727 --> 02:09:40,398
He has many grandsons... your age.

684
02:09:46,195 --> 02:09:49,407
This is war. No one is to blame.

685
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:51,033
That's what the German said.

686
02:09:51,117 --> 02:09:54,370
You dog! You swine!

687
02:09:56,872 --> 02:09:59,875
Typical German!

688
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:03,462
Asshole!

689
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:06,882
It was him.

690
02:10:08,467 --> 02:10:14,765
He's the one who said,
"Leave the kids and you're free to go."

691
02:10:16,767 --> 02:10:21,355
If they left the kids, they could go.

692
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:27,028
He's a fascist, a butcher.
He has no heart.

693
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:33,951
Yes, I'm the one who said,
"Without the kids, you can leave.

694
02:10:34,785 --> 02:10:36,203
But the kids must stay."

695
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:39,999
Translate.

696
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:50,968
Because all the trouble starts with kids.

697
02:10:54,096 --> 02:10:55,973
Your nation doesn't deserve to exist.

698
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:03,647
Some nations have no right to a future.

699
02:11:03,731 --> 02:11:05,608
Listen.

700
02:11:07,318 --> 02:11:09,153
I want everybody to listen, all of you.

701
02:11:20,915 --> 02:11:24,126
Inferior races spread
the communist contagion.

702
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:27,797
Your nation doesn't deserve to exist.

703
02:11:32,551 --> 02:11:34,845
We will fulfill this objective.

704
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:38,307
If not today, then tomorrow.

705
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:01,539
I didn't say that. He did.

706
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:05,751
We're not Germans!

707
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:09,797
We're not Germans!
Never again. Forgive us! We won't.

708
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:13,884
We're not Germans! We're not Germans!

709
02:12:15,636 --> 02:12:20,850
Germans or not!
Have you forgotten what they did?

710
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:24,103
They're cannibals!
Shooting them isn't enough.

711
02:12:24,186 --> 02:12:27,606
We're not Germans!

712
02:12:29,442 --> 02:12:31,986
Then what are you, you bastard?

713
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:33,863
They forced us to do it.

714
02:12:33,946 --> 02:12:36,449
We're not Germans!

715
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:41,912
Kill the fascist rats!

716
02:12:41,996 --> 02:12:46,250
Kill them! Kill them!

717
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:55,926
You can do it, seeing as
you're right there among them.

718
02:13:06,103 --> 02:13:09,106
Give it here! Give it to me!

719
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:12,109
Brothers! I'm on your side, brothers!

720
02:13:12,193 --> 02:13:15,321
I'm one of you. I'm on your side.

721
02:13:25,706 --> 02:13:28,334
Matches, comrades.

722
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:30,920
Comrades! Matches!

723
02:13:31,003 --> 02:13:34,381
- Make way!
- That's enough! Enough!

724

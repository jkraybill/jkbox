00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:22,220
      <i> Baikie is a douce,</i>       
      <i> respectable town,</i>        

2
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,156
<i> notable for its equable climate</i>

3
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,958
  <i> and for the bracing quality</i>  
  <i> of its sea air.</i>              

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,028
<i> We have never gone in for brash</i>
<i> advertizing in Baikie.</i>         

5
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,365
 <i> It has always been felt that</i>  
 <i> the attractions of the town</i>   

6
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,467
     <i> speak for themselves.</i>     

7
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,369
       <i> Foremost among</i>          
       <i> these attractions</i>       

8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,704
      <i> are the waters</i>           
      <i> of the Baikie spa.</i>       

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,106
      <i> For 100 years,</i>           
      <i> discerning visitors</i>      

10
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,777
<i> have gained much benefit</i>       
<i> from their medical properties.</i> 

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,313
<i> Mohammed has been in the habit,</i>
<i> so to speak,</i>                   

12
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,382
  <i> of coming to the mountain.</i>   

13
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,652
  <i> We propose to change that.</i>   

14
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,489
 <i> Times are hard. Rates</i>         
 <i> and unemployment are rising.</i>  

15
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,291
<i> So the forward-thinking members</i>

16
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,293
    <i> of the governing board</i>     
    <i> of the spa</i>                 

17
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,194
<i> recently came to the conclusion</i>

18
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:08,100
   <i> that we should capitalize</i>   
   <i> upon this valuable asset.</i>   

19
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,435
They provided substantial funds 

20
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,305
      with which to set up      
      this enterprise,          

21
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:17,108
     to make Baikie water       
     more widely available.     

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,844
    Mainly in the interests     
    of the health               

23
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,313
     of the general public,     
     of course.                 

24
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,048
     But there is no doubt      

25
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:30,154
that the advantages accruing to 
the town will be considerable.  

26
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,625
   "Bottled in Baikie,          
   the Vichy of the north..."   

27
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,961
 - The Vichy of the north?      
 - ..will become a catchphrase. 

28
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:41,433
It is therefore with confidence 
in our future prosperity        

29
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,202
  that I now set this project   
  in motion.                    

30
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,674
           (Applause)           

31
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,165
     Here you are, Willie.      

32
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,468
            Provost.            

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,069
           Thank you.           

34
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,167
     Hello, there, Captain.     
     Come on in.                

35
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,276
- That's it, then, Mrs. Curran. 
- Oh, thank you.                

36
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:36,180
 That's the stuff. They'll soon 
 be better with that.           

37
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,682
         - Good night.          
         - Good night.          

38
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,219
 - That's it, then, Captain.    
 - Are we taking a dram, then?  

39
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,722
     Damn it, not tonight.      
     I've people waiting.       

40
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,624
   OK. I'll look in tomorrow.   

41
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,693
 Come up to the house. You want 
 to see Peggy, don't you?       

42
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,863
- You'll get your tea.          
- That sounds like a good idea. 

43
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,998
  - You'll get a dram as well.  
  - That's even a better idea.  

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,067
  (Tom) Right. Shut the shop.   

45
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,245
          (Hums tune)           

46
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,857
- Hello, Katherine.             
- Oh, it's you, Peter. Come in. 

47
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,626
           Thank you.           

48
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,830
- Tom's still busy in the shop. 
- At this hour?                 

49
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,865
   Dr. Monroe's just finished   
   his surgery                  

50
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,233
 but he shouldn't be too long.  

51
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,268
 We're in the garden, actually. 

52
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,407
      There's folk waiting      
      for him already.          

53
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,144
   Tom's too easy. His hours    
   are stated on the door.      

54
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,980
 - People should keep to them.  
 - So should he.                

55
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,082
     He makes appointments      
     to see folk                

56
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,218
 and then leaves me to cover up 
 for him when he's late.        

57
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,486
            Exactly.            

58
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,989
You know Mr. Houston, don't you?

59
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,190
     Good evening, Provost.     

60
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,860
      - Mr. Carmichael.         
      - Evening, Provost.       

61
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,195
   The Baikie Advertiser here   
   in strength, I see.          

62
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,198
   A social call, I presume.    

63
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,369
  Not exactly. We just wanted   
  a wee chat about an article   

64
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,804
       your brother wrote       
       some time ago.           

65
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,373
         About the spa.         

66
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,208
This seemed an opportune moment.

67
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,611
    Can I get you something     
    to drink, Peter?            

68
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,980
     Eh? No. No, thank you.     

69
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,882
  It's a little early for me.   

70
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,853
   - John?                      
   - Just a wee one, please.    

71
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,155
        Aye, thank you.         

72
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,624
Sorry you're having such a wait,

73
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,927
      but I'm sure Tom'll       
      not be long now.          

74
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,898
 My brother's getting to be one 
 of your regular contributors.  

75
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,834
  We're very glad to have him.  
  Thank you.                    

76
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,236
 Tends to be a little outspoken 
 at times.                      

77
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,507
He has the knack of putting     
his finger on a home truth, yes.

78
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,910
   Um... Would you excuse me    
   just for a minute?           

79
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,685
 I suppose his lively style     
 would appeal to your readers,  

80
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,788
 though, of course, I've no ill 
 will against your paper.       

81
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,122
   It's excellent in its way.   

82
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,657
      Thank you, Provost.       

83
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,559
     Aye. There's room for      
     everything.                

84
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,828
  That's one of the admirable   
  characteristics               

85
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,463
       of our community.        

86
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,098
    The spirit of toleration    

87
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,167
   coupled with a willingness   
   to move with the times.      

88
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,403
  Like bottling the spa water.  

89
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,038
            Exactly.            

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,975
 Look at us. We used to be just 
 a quiet little seaside town.   

91
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,946
 Not now. People are beginning  
 to know the name of Baikie.    

92
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,348
 They see the name of the town  
 on the label of the bottle,    

93
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,350
  and want to visit the place   
  where it's made.              

94
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,920
   House and property values    
   are going up.                

95
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,055
   This is not to be quoted,    

96
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:36,694
but we could be the only council
not to increase its rates.      

97
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,429
    Better get two bottles.     

98
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,799
 Goodness knows how much longer 
 your father's going to be.     

99
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,336
Oh, and Peggy, get some crisps. 
You know, nibbling things.      

100
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,971
   Otherwise they'll be in no   
   fit state                    

101
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,305
     to talk to him             
     when he does come in.      

102
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:53,077
 Have you seen the most recent  
 unemployment figures?          

103
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,511
 Tourism and the bottling plant 

104
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:57,214
 will reduce them to the lowest 
 in this part of Scotland.      

105
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,850
    We'll be featuring that     
    in our next issue,          

106
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,517
    alongside                   
    your brother's article.     

107
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,188
 Yes, I believe you said        
 it was composed some time ago. 

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,791
Yes, it was published originally
in a technical journal.         

109
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,393
This'll be a simplified version 
for the general public.         

110
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,896
All about the therapeutic value 
of the water.                   

111
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,298
   Tom's quite a fanatic        
   where the spa's concerned.   

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,467
  So he should be, Katherine.   

113
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,703
   He draws a generous fee as   
   technical adviser.           

114
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,806
  And they do say he was        
  the driving force behind it.  

115
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,475
            Do they?            

116
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,277
 Any mention of the work put in 
 by the board of directors?     

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,946
Nobody would deny you've all put
a lot into it, Peter,           

118
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,347
       least of all Tom.        

119
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,551
It was the board who initiated  
the bottling project, after all.

120
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,854
   Were you aware that Thomas   
   wasn't too keen on it?       

121
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,923
      Oh? On what grounds?      

122
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,825
      Oh, his argument          
      was somewhat vague.       

123
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,394
  It was something to do with   
  the balance of nature.        

124
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,497
  I fail to see the connection  
  myself.                       

125
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,632
    I'm afraid when it comes    
    to practical matters,       

126
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,702
my brother's not exactly gifted 
with commercial foresight.      

127
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,070
I was surprised to find you open
so late, Tom.                   

128
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,739
 If I wait till after surgery,  

129
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,474
   they start getting better    
   12 hours earlier             

130
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,276
    with very little effort     
    on my part.                 

131
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,979
  Cannae turn sick folk away.   

132
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,547
 Hope the news hounds have left 
 some tonic in the bottle.      

133
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,151
             Kath?              

134
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,454
  They must be outside. Ho-ho!  

135
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,523
 The symbol of civic authority. 

136
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,525
    I see we've got another     
    distinguished guest.        

137
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,527
      - Aye. The Provost?       
      - None other.             

138
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,095
     In that case, Tom,         
     I think I'll push off.     

139
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,731
   Not at all. The best thing   
   about my brother's visits    

140
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,867
       is their brevity.        

141
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,902
          Kate? Kate?           

142
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,905
    The captain for a dram.     

143
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,974
   - Hello, Donald.             
   - Is that all that's left?   

144
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,576
     There's more coming.       
     Peggy's bringing some.     

145
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,712
    - You might have known.     
    - That you'd be so late?    

146
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,015
          Any letters?          

147
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,382
      Well, there's bills       
      by the look of them.      

148
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,017
       Could I see them?        

149
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,953
They're on the hall table, dear.

150
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,191
            Donald?             

151
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,864
  Brother Peter. David, John.   

152
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,134
 Take that stuff neat, Donald.  
 It's a good malt.              

153
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,337
  We need strong young men      
  like you to stir things up.   

154
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,173
  And what, may one ask,        
  needs stirring up in Baikie?  

155
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:06,210
  Oh, well, Provost. The best   
  broth deserves a good stir.   

156
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,613
 That's a very peculiar remark. 

157
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,782
  Don't take it too literally   
  for the minute.               

158
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:14,185
Mr. Houston tells me he's going 
to publish an article of yours. 

159
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,053
        - Oh, aye?              
        - About the spa.        

160
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,591
 Ah, well, yes.                 
 Cannae publish that just yet.  

161
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,026
Well, that's bad news. Why not? 

162
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,195
The town needs all the publicity
it can get.                     

163
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,897
    In normal circumstances.    

164
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,932
       What's abnormal          
       about the present?       

165
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,968
Now, look. I cannae say anything
about it...                     

166
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,536
   (Katherine) Yoo-hoo! Tom?    

167
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,205
           Excuse me.           

168
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,410
        Is that the lot?        

169
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,412
   Was there a telephone call   
   for me from Glasgow?         

170
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,181
             - No.              
             - Oh.              

171
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,021
   Well, it's a bit late now.   
   But I might be able          

172
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,990
 to say something more definite 
 tomorrow.                      

173
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,258
    You see, there might be     
    something very abnormal     

174
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,427
       or I might just be       
       imagining things.        

175
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,697
I simply do not know. Are you   
gonna take a dram before you go?

176
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,934
  This sounds very mysterious,  
  Thomas.                       

177
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,601
 Is it something I should know  
 about?                         

178
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,570
    Look, Peter. I can't...     

179
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,872
   I insist that all matters    
   concerning the spa           

180
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,741
  should be passed through the  
  proper channels.              

181
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,143
    I can allow no one to go    
    behind our backs.           

182
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,246
     Nobody is going behind     
     your back.                 

183
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,313
        I'm not so sure.        

184
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,715
     You have a pig-headed      
     determination              

185
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,517
      to go your own way.       

186
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,353
     And that's not the way     
     to do things               

187
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,121
 in our well-ordered community. 

188
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,859
As for publishing anything about
the spa in a newspaper...       

189
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,327
 I happen to own the newspaper, 
 Provost.                       

190
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,729
  Mr. Carmichael's my editor.   
  We...                         

191
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,731
   I'm addressing my brother,   
   Mr. Houston.                 

192
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,832
  Nobody's publishing anything  
  at the minute,                

193
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,970
   so why don't you sit back    
   and relax?                   

194
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,139
       My wife assures me       

195
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,574
that our sadly-diminished stocks
of liquor                       

196
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,178
 are soon to be replenished,    
 so you can join us in a dram.  

197
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,513
     I don't feel like          
     an evening's drinking.     

198
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,885
     I wasnae offering you      
     an evening's drinking,     

199
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,920
      but please yourself.      

200
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,590
      I shall. Gentlemen.       

201
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,325
        - (All) Provost.        
        - Captain.              

202
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,860
            Provost.            

203
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,896
       I'll see him out.        

204
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,766
   - Good night, Katherine.     
   - Oh, are you away, Peter?   

205
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,034
            Bye-bye.            

206
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,409
 I'm afraid my brother-in-law's 
 not in the best of moods.      

207
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,677
   He's a man used to getting   
   his own way.                 

208
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,079
          He is that.           

209
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,481
 Perhaps the presence           
 of the Advertiser's upset him. 

210
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,250
       I don't think so.        

211
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,419
You seemed to be getting on fine
with him.                       

212
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,255
 An armed truce, Mrs. Stockman. 

213
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,958
  The provost and I are on      
  opposite sides of the fence.  

214
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,473
Are you sure there's nothing you
ought to be telling me?         

215
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,808
    Not just at the minute.     

216
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,278
 I've warned you. You can't say 
 I haven't warned you.          

217
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,647
There's nothing we can do about 
that either.                    

218
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,258
  Are you sure there wasn't a   
  telephone call from Glasgow?  

219
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
          Quite sure.           

220
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,728
 Couldn't have rung and nobody  
 took any notice?               

221
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,165
- Don't be silly.               
- It could happen in this house.

222
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,599
        Well, it didn't.        

223
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,468
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

224
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,609
When will you be sailing again, 
Captain?                        

225
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,811
       Ooh, I've no idea.       

226
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,447
   My ship's been laid up       
   for two months, refitting.   

227
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,249
  If there's another strike or  
  go-slow,                      

228
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,386
 it could be the same again.    
 That's how it goes these days. 

229
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,155
 Dear, oh, dear, Captain. That  
 must be very frustrating.      

230
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,091
   How do you pass your time?   

231
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,492
 Quite usefully, as it happens. 

232
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,295
  My parents left me            
  a great barracks of a house,  

233
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,797
    but I had no use for it,    

234
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,799
     so my sister turned it     
     into a hotel.              

235
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,467
    - It's a good site.         
    - It's doing very well.     

236
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,469
We're building a new extension. 

237
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,104
That'll cost you a pretty penny.

238
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,439
  When the anticipated tourist  
  boom takes place,             

239
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,707
  we'll all end up very rich,   

240
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,542
   though I have no romantic    
   notions of it.               

241
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,777
You see before you a happy man. 

242
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,579
  Aye, it looks like it, Tom.   

243
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,548
 Sorry about the article, John. 

244
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,617
So am I. We'd like to have used 
it on Saturday.                 

245
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,320
 Maybe it'll still be possible, 
 but send me out a copy first.  

246
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:13,757
 I sympathize with Peter.       
 You're being very mysterious.  

247
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,826
    I'm not gonna rush into     
    this one.                   

248
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,328
            (Phone)             

249
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,263
       That could be him.       

250
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,668
  - Hello, Peggy. You're late.  
  - That's the phone, Dad.      

251
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,103
           So it is.            

252
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,140
         Tom Stockman.          

253
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,208
           Ah. Angus.           

254
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,745
    Great. Well, better late    
    than never.                 

255
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,447
         Just a minute.         

256
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,018
     Right. Read it to me.      

257
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,857
 Thank goodness. You take that  
 out and hold the fort.         

258
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,392
        Who's out there?        

259
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,462
Mr. Houston and John Carmichael 
from The Advertiser.            

260
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,865
     Oh, and someone else!      

261
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,900
           Oh, Mum...           

262
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,668
        Chrome sulphate?        

263
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:05,576
Now, what would its toxic effect
be in these quantities?         

264
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,345
 No, no, no. I suppose it isn't 
 your business                  

265
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,080
   but it shouldn't be there    
   at all.                      

266
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,783
    Aye, yes. Go on, please.    

267
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,019
        - Hi.                   
        - Hello, Peggy.         

268
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,722
      - Well, here it is.       
      - Ah, great.              

269
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,624
         At long last.          

270
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,159
           Thank you.           

271
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,096
     - Hello.                   
     - Hello. You're late.      

272
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,132
   Parent-teachers meeting      
   on top of everything else.   

273
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,801
     - Not a good day, huh?     
     - No worse than usual.     

274
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,804
  It's the size of the class.   
  I've got nearly 40 just now.  

275
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,939
              40?               

276
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,073
   And thousands of teachers    
   unemployed.                  

277
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,008
- Quite.                        
- How do you control that many? 

278
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,345
 I can control them all right,  
 but I can't teach them.        

279
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,115
  You see, they range from      
  very bright to rather slow.   

280
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,083
I have to go at the pace of the 
slowest                         

281
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,252
while the bright ones get bored.
That's not fair.                

282
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,686
     And are the dull ones      
     not entitled               

283
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,855
    to as much consideration    
    as the bright?              

284
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,959
You've missed the point. I was  
thinking of equalizing upwards. 

285
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,760
      I was just checking.      

286
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,762
Do you know what I'd like to do?

287
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,497
I'd love to start a class in the
evenings                        

288
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,866
    and give the slower ones    
    the attention they need.    

289
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,568
      - In your own time?       
      - Why not?                

290
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,804
- You're tired enough as it is. 
- I'd be doing something useful.

291
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,008
I don't think the provost or    
the town council would allow it.

292
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,944
 - Never.                       
 - I could do it off my own bat 

293
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,711
 but accommodation's a problem. 

294
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,981
    There just isn't enough     
    room here.                  

295
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:20,151
    Listen, that mightn't be    
    such a problem.             

296
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,320
 I'm not just talking about two 
 or three kids.                 

297
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,955
      More like 10 or 12.       

298
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,623
 Maybe we could find you a room 
 at the hotel.                  

299
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,891
    (Houston) There you are.    

300
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,561
          - Could you?          
          - I'll see.           

301
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,100
  This is gonna make everybody  
  sit up.                       

302
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,135
              Who?              

303
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,202
     The whole population.      

304
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,772
        Why? What is it?        

305
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,741
    - It's a discovery.         
    - Oh, hell. Another one.    

306
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,145
 It's a very interesting piece  
 of scientific detection.       

307
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,947
It'll teach people to talk about
my pig-headed determination     

308
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,183
       to go my own way.        

309
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,850
       What is it, dear?        

310
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,621
This is an analysis of the water
of Baikie spa.                  

311
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,856
   Generally considered to be   
   of therapeutic value.        

312
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,159
    Invalids drink it           
    when they can afford to.    

313
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,562
   And we're now stockpiling    
   vast quantities of it        

314
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,630
to ship abroad and get ourselves
a reputation                    

315
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,898
   of the Vichy of the north.   

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,800
 (Katherine) We know all that,  
 dear.                          

317
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,937
But do you know what the waters 
of Baikie spa really are?       

318
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,807
  - Yes, they're medicinal...   
  - They're a slow poison.      

319
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,276
     - Absurd.                  
     - But perfectly true.      

320
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,077
Could you pour us a dram, dear? 

321
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,415
    What gave you this idea?    

322
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,218
 I've had a number of customers 
 with similar illnesses.        

323
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,753
I can tell by the prescriptions 
and by the look of them,        

324
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,388
     jaundice for a start.      

325
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,690
 So I began to think there was  
 a toxic element.               

326
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,160
    And I began to look for     
    a common source.            

327
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,462
And I discovered that they'd all
been drinking spa water.        

328
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,331
            Cheers.             

329
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,099
   People have been taking it   
   for years.                   

330
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,967
Drawing it by the cupful, fine. 

331
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,370
   But now they're taking off   
   vast quantities              

332
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,905
 and I believe that's affected  
 the water table.               

333
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,308
  That's the general level of   
  water below the ground.       

334
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,244
    I suppose it's possible.    
    What about it?              

335
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,713
  The well is being forced to   
  replenish itself              

336
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,649
from further and further afield.

337
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,318
      New constituents          
      are seeping into it.      

338
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,187
   Your brother said you were   
   against the plant.           

339
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,522
Had you foreseen this happening?

340
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,259
  I warned them. If tinker      
  with the balance of nature,   

341
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,294
 unexpected things can happen.  

342
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:14,465
 It now contains appreciable    
 quantities of chrome sulphate. 

343
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,568
And my customers were suffering 
from chrome poisoning.          

344
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,804
    My God. Any idea            
    where it's coming from?     

345
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,443
 Well, chrome sulphate is used  
 to tan leather                 

346
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,110
   and the Dalhousie tannery    
   is only four miles away.     

347
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,545
             What?              

348
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,847
    Your father's tannery's     
    the probable source.        

349
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,651
 Well, I don't know what he'll  
 say about that.                

350
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,553
 But I'm sure it's a good thing 
 that you've discovered it.     

351
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,689
- Of course it is.              
- (Peggy) What can be done, Dad?

352
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,258
   - It'll need to be sorted.   
   - Can it be sorted?          

353
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,961
  I don't know. We cannae use   
  the spa in the meantime.      

354
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,598
  Why did you not tell anybody  
  about this before?            

355
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,534
    Because I wanted            
    an independent analysis.    

356
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,336
Baikie folk wouldn't believe me.

357
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,139
 Still, I think you might have  
 told us, your own family.      

358
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,609
 (Tom) Still, your grandfather  
 should be the first to know.   

359
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:02,479
      He'll be interested.      
      It's his tannery.         

360
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,448
    I put a formal report in    
    to Peter.                   

361
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,882
       He won't like it.        

362
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,051
He'll be glad it's been brought 
to light.                       

363
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,488
 Tom? Will you give us a piece  
 for The Advertiser?            

364
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,458
    Two or three paragraphs.    
    Simple language.            

365
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,661
I don't see why not.            
It's a matter of public concern.

366
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,463
           Precisely.           

367
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,697
   You know, of course, Tom.    

368
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,099
    This will enhance your      
    reputation even further.    

369
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:25,436
 (Houston) Your concern         
 for the welfare of the people  

370
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,203
      is very refreshing.       

371
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,372
   (Peggy) That's true, Dad.    

372
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,645
         - (Tom) Kate?          
         - Hello?               

373
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,115
    There we are.               
    Ten past 12 on the dot.     

374
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,084
    Well, you're too early.     

375
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,086
           For once.            

376
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,320
         Any messages?          

377
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,256
Peter rang. He wants to see you.

378
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,025
He said he'll be at the bottling
plant this afternoon.           

379
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,061
      Is that all he said?      

380
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,129
     I don't think it's all     
     he wanted to say.          

381
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,332
      He was being careful      
      over the phone.           

382
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,868
Aye, that's why he didn't phone 
the shop.                       

383
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,403
   He's a funny fellow.         
   Hates to think of anybody    

384
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,340
  doing anything for this town  
  if it's not himself.          

385
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,610
 Could you not share the credit 
 with him?                      

386
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,446
   Make out that he gave you    
   the idea. Something.         

387
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,081
     I don't care who gets      
     the credit.                

388
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,249
      The important thing       
      is to get it sorted.      

389
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,352
 My father phoned. He wants to  
 see you too.                   

390
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,389
       I'm not surprised.       

391
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,358
      Mrs. Mackintosh.          
      I've got her pills.       

392
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,494
    She must have forgotten     
    it was early closing.       

393
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,295
     I'll call in on Archie     
     on the way back.           

394
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,366
 Well, don't be too long. I've  
 got the women's rule at three. 

395
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,150
    Who's there? Who is it?     

396
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,656
 - Oh, it's you, Mr. Stockman.  
 - Hello, Mrs. Mackintosh.      

397
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,925
   - Good afternoon.            
   - He's looking very well.    

398
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,961
   - Oh, aye. He's fine now.    
   - I brought your pills.      

399
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,665
    Oh, dear. Aren't I silly    
    to forget those, eh?        

400
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,066
        It's no trouble,        
        Mrs. Mackintosh.        

401
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,001
      Oh, taking up             
      your precious time.       

402
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,938
     My time is my own.         
     It's my afternoon off.     

403
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,441
       Oh, you're kind.         
       You're very kind.        

404
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,317
          Oh, heavens.          

405
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,724
           Oh, damn!            

406
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,160
      Morning, Archie.          
      What's the trouble?       

407
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,363
      I've got black spot.      

408
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,799
 How does it affect you?        
 Can you describe the symptoms? 

409
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,101
  God's sake, it's not on me.   
  On my roses. Look.            

410
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,403
       I don't know much        
       about gardening.         

411
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,138
  - I leave that to Katherine.  
  - It's a fungus.              

412
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,642
Catch it quick or it spreads    
and can destroy the whole plant.

413
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,212
  Hey, by the way. What's this  
  damn fool story of Peggy's?   

414
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,547
    Something about poison.     

415
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,816
        - She told you.         
        - Yes.                  

416
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,951
Came in this morning especially 
on her way past to tell me.     

417
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,553
     What's she up to, eh?      

418
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,923
 She's not trying to take       
 the mickey out of me, is she?  

419
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,659
- No, no. She wouldn't do that. 
- I should hope not.            

420
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,097
     Do you mean to tell me     
     it's true?                 

421
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,365
           Perfectly.           

422
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,204
  Oh, well. I don't blame you.  
  Must be quite a temptation.   

423
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,439
            What is?            

424
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,842
 To make a fool of that brother 
 of yours.                      

425
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,710
    But it's perfectly true.    

426
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,746
    The water's contaminated    
    all right.                  

427
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,349
      With chrome sulphate      
      from my tannery?          

428
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,583
           Probably.            

429
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,484
    (Scoffs) He's not gonna     
    believe that.               

430
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,286
    He's got to believe it.     
    Everybody will.             

431
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,955
           Everybody?           

432
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,323
      (Chuckles) Oh, well.      

433
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,991
       Good luck to you.        

434
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:12,696
   Ah, well. Serve 'em right.   

435
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,264
They threw me out of the council

436
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,100
 because I used to give them    
 a bit of my mind now and again 

437
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,402
and they didn't like it one bit.

438
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,137
There's nothing in these fella''
heads                           

439
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,773
 but feathering their own nests 

440
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,175
   and running other people's   
   lives for them.              

441
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,079
  You pull their legs good and  
  hard. It'll do them no harm.  

442
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,748
   Look, it's perfectly true.   
   The water's contaminated.    

443
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,284
   Oh, sure, it's true, yeah.   
   (Chuckles)                   

444
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,653
   Perfectly true, I'm sure.    

445
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,489
         Tell you what.         

446
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,891
      I'll give you a box       
      of Havana cigars          

447
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,459
  if you can get away with it.  

448
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,028
      - Right. You're on.       
      - Good.                   

449
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,931
I think I'll go and see Houston 
before I see Peter.             

450
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,200
   Houston? Is he in on this?   

451
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,467
Aye. You could put it like that.

452
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:54,571
     Oh. Well done, Thomas.     

453
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,807
   You're going the right way   
   about it.                    

454
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,310
 Get it into the newspapers and 
 you'll pull it off all right.  

455
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,588
   What about the spa piece?    

456
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,457
Well, I've kept half a          
half-column for the front page. 

457
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,828
 That should be enough.         
 The first blast of a trumpet.  

458
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,864
 - Aye, when we get started...  
 - Houston?                     

459
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,266
     - Mr. Stockman's here.     
     - Which one?               

460
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,301
         The human one.         

461
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,337
   I'll see him in my office.   

462
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,372
    That's fine, John.          
    You're doing a good job.    

463
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,946
 Oh, Mary. Bring three coffees. 

464
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,583
           On a tray.           

465
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,852
   (Tom) Sir, has the provost   
   seen you before?             

466
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,688
- I'm seeing him this afternoon.
- I've been thinking about this.

467
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,822
             Good.              

468
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,624
   For you,                     
   it's an isolated incident,   

469
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,159
 but I don't think you realize  
 how much it involves.          

470
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,662
   A considerable expense,      
   but that can't be avoided.   

471
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,098
   See, that's what I wanted    
   to talk over with you.       

472
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,069
   You think the source of      
   pollution is the tannery.    

473
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,104
- Yes.                          
- Well, there's another source. 

474
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,839
     And it's contaminating     
     more than the spa.         

475
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,675
       It's contaminating       
       the whole town.          

476
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,477
 - Know what I'm talking about? 
 - No idea.                     

477
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,613
   Mainly, I'm talking about    
   the council.                 

478
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,816
 Not all the council. Some are  
 reasonable, decent people      

479
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,050
     doing what they think      
     is a decent job.           

480
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,686
But a few of them have the whole
power of this place             

481
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,921
        in their hands.         

482
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,588
They and the people behind them.

483
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,425
      - What people?            
      - Oh, come on, now.       

484
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,027
The people who don't want change

485
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,830
 unless there's something in it 
 for them.                      

486
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,297
 The people on the council are  
 there                          

487
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,699
  because they've got ability.  

488
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,001
   Did they show any ability    
   or experience                

489
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,502
     when they agreed           
     to the bottling plant?     

490
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,471
 - Against your advice?         
 - No, but that was a mistake.  

491
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,906
     That'll be put right.      

492
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,242
  - You think it's that easy?   
  - It's gotta be done.         

493
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,277
    It will be done             
    if I take the thing up.     

494
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,212
     I want your campaign.      

495
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,015
  Oh, no. That sort of thing's  
  not necessary.                

496
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,718
    I'm sure that the people    
    on the council              

497
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,419
 have the interests of the town 
 at heart.                      

498
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,921
         Well, I'm not.         

499
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,456
 When I bought The Advertiser,  

500
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,092
       I wanted to break        
       these people up.         

501
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,461
     Let in some fresh air.     

502
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,231
  I wanted this town to be      
  a friendly, cheerful place,   

503
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,565
  for the fellow who's earning  
  his daily bread.              

504
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,868
 I know, you told me.           
 They nearly broke you instead. 

505
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,136
             Yeah.              

506
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:43,106
Yes, very nearly.               
I was on the edge of going bust.

507
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:47,510
 Then I got help from...        
 well, someone I didn't expect. 

508
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,212
    I've been keeping quiet     
    for a while, Tom,           

509
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,182
     but now I'm just about     
     ready again.               

510
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,751
      It's the corruption       
      behind the red tape       

511
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,020
 and official bloody-mindedness 
 I want to get at.              

512
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,355
 I want this town run for       
 the sake of the town's people  

513
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,924
       instead of a few         
       wealthy parasites.       

514
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,125
          Commendable.          

515
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,526
    You have given me a peg     
    to hang it on.              

516
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,897
- A what?                       
- I had to work my way up, Tom. 

517
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,732
 I know what it's like          
 to be the bottom of the heap.  

518
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,868
           - (Phone)            
           - Hello?             

519
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,703
    Do you know what people     
    think of me?                

520
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,205
   Sorry, he's in a meeting.    

521
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,540
  They think I'm dangerous.     
  They think I'm an agitator.   

522
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,143
- Do they?                      
- Yeah. And they're quite right.

523
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,145
       - (Knock on door)        
       - Come in.               

524
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,384
 I thought I'd save the lassie  
 the stairs.                    

525
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,119
     Thank you, Mr. Geikie.     

526
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,187
Machine coffee, I'm afraid, Tom.

527
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,990
         Ah. Thank you.         

528
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,691
       Missed my dinner.        

529
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,459
           Thank you.           

530
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,561
  Is it true what I hear, sir,  

531
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,131
   that you've been demanding   
   improvements                 

532
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,499
in the water supply to the spa? 

533
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,336
   Well, I suppose you could    
   put it like that.            

534
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:50,273
Any scheme to improve the town's
amenities will have my support. 

535
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,408
    That's very kind of you.    

536
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,676
    It wouldn't do any harm     

537
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,813
   to have the working people   
   of Baikie behind you.        

538
00:26:56,815 --> 00:27:02,285
The proletariat. We form,       
as it were, the silent majority.

539
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,253
  And it's always a good thing  

540
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,455
      to have the majority      
      on your side.             

541
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,090
    It is, but not necessary    
    in this case.               

542
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,259
No, the whole thing is perfectly
straightforward.                

543
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,460
   If you'll pardon me, sir,    

544
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,495
  I know our local authorities  
  very well                     

545
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,964
       and they're often        
       quite reluctant          

546
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,633
  to act on proposals           
  that come from other people.  

547
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,403
     If we could get up         
     a wee demonstration...     

548
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,438
        A demonstration?        

549
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,739
Aye, about the new water supply.

550
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,676
  With moderation, of course.   
  Great moderation.             

551
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,678
      That has always been      
      my watchword.             

552
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,480
  A well-known characteristic   
  of yours.                     

553
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,015
Both in my trade union capacity 

554
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,750
      and as chairman           
      of the rate-payers.       

555
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:36,186
       I'll see you have        
       the full support         

556
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,222
      both of my members        
      and the rate-payers.      

557
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,024
      Geikie, about             
      this demonstration.       

558
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,626
    We'll have a word later,    
    Mr. Carmichael.             

559
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,863
       Now we must show         
       great moderation.        

560
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,365
 I mean, no point               
 in offending the authorities.  

561
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,267
    That never did any good     
    to anybody.                 

562
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,403
 But they can't take exception  

563
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,840
to a moderate and reasonable    
demonstration of public opinion.

564
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,209
I'm sure it'll not be necessary.

565
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,779
    Well, the authorities       
    are always slow to act.     

566
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,281
  We'll stir them up in         
  The Advertiser, Mr. Geikie.   

567
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,484
      Aye. Well, remember,      
      do you no harm            

568
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,654
   to have the ordinary folk    
   of this town behind you.     

569
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,922
       No, of course not.       

570
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,760
   Well, I'll away and get on   
   with it, then.               

571
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,063
Well, it's er...very reassuring.

572
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,631
      He's a well-meaning       
      sort of chap.             

573
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,067
  We've too many well-meaning,  
  decent folk                   

574
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,002
that wouldn't put out           
their tongues at a tame rabbit. 

575
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,904
  You can't blame the council   
  for kicking them around.      

576
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,973
     This town needs people     
     with drive and guts.       

577
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,742
   Tom, did you do that piece   
   for us?                      

578
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,844
No, I brought you this instead. 

579
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,615
   It's a copy of my official   
   report to the provost.       

580
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,883
      That's even better.       

581
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,885
    Treat it as confidential    
    for the minute.             

582
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,254
 Now, if I have any difficulty  

583
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,889
   in getting what I consider   
   to be adequate action,       

584
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,625
   then you can make what use   
   you like of it.              

585
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,293
  We shouldn't start the ball   
  rolling?                      

586
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,998
No. I think we give the council 
a chance to put matters right.  

587
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,933
     I'm inclined to agree.     

588
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,370
   Let's save our ammunition    
   until we need it.            

589
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,105
           All right.           

590
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,474
 But the moment you find you're 
 up against a brick wall,       

591
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,077
 and I'll be very surprised     
 if you don't, you let me know. 

592
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,745
  Certainly. But I don't think  
  we'll have any trouble.       

593
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,881
              No?               

594
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,753
 I noticed you express yourself 
 with your customary violence.  

595
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,855
 The remark that we're peddling 

596
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:22,826
  an expensive but effective    
  method of self-destruction.   

597
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,361
That's what it'll come to       
unless we do something about it.

598
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,230
       You conclude that        
       the toxic material       

599
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,099
 - is coming from the tannery.  
 - Yes.                         

600
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,002
 I called in on Charlie Duncan  
 this morning.                  

601
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,803
      You play bridge           
      in the mornings now?      

602
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,972
  In his capacity as chairman   

603
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,474
      of the environmental      
      health committee.         

604
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,176
         Sorry, sorry.          

605
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,079
 I put your theory to him       
 as a hypothetical possibility, 

606
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,915
     something that might       
     have to be dealt with      

607
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,316
    some time in the future.    

608
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,219
     - In the future?           
     - We had a good laugh.     

609
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,854
            Did you?            

610
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:54,957
 The effluent from the tannery  
 goes into a settling pond.     

611
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,759
 It is then carefully filtered  

612
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,295
   before it passes into        
   the public sewerage system   

613
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,298
   by which time                
   it is completely harmless.   

614
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,734
  No, it's nothing to do with   
  the public sewerage system.   

615
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,337
     It's probably seeping      
     from the settling pond     

616
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,339
   down into the water taper.   

617
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:12,275
 We considered that. It's       
 imaginative to say the least.  

618
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,877
 - It's in line with the facts. 
 - In your opinion.             

619
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:21,117
 Have you considered what might 
 be involved?                   

620
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,818
 Well, that's not my business.  

621
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,620
The tannery would have to close.

622
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,523
  To rebuild the settling pond  

623
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,059
 would require a very large sum 
 of money.                      

624
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,893
    And with the spa closed,    

625
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:34,998
that would be the two principle 
sources of prosperity gone.     

626
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,599
        I've no choice.         

627
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,402
   And in the end,              
   your theory may well prove   

628
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,437
     to have no foundation.     

629
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,038
         It's unlikely.         

630
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,075
  I am not convinced the water  
  is as bad as you make out.    

631
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,609
 The figures are in my report.  

632
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,845
      They come from            
      a reputable analyst.      

633
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,780
   If we go on drawing water    
   at the present rate,         

634
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,449
  they're bound to get worse.   

635
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,051
     I still think you're       
     exaggerating somewhat.     

636
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,991
 Would it not be possible,      
 Thomas, for a capable chemist  

637
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:04,160
    to prevent any injurious    
    influences                  

638
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,196
   from becoming too obvious?   

639
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,167
  This plant is an established  
  fact. We must face it.        

640
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,236
    And the council might be    
    prepared                    

641
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,570
to consider certain improvements

642
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,108
  consistent with a reasonable  
  expenditure.                  

643
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,144
 I'm not gonna have anything to 
 do with trickery of that sort. 

644
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,579
    - Trickery?                 
    - Fraud. Criminal fraud.    

645
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,749
   All I am asking you to do    
   is wait.                     

646
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,818
 Later, I'll raise the question 
 in council                     

647
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,320
    and we'll do what we can    
    in private                  

648
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,122
     but in the meantime...     

649
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:37,427
In the meantime, not a word of  
this must get to the public ear.

650
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,562
        - It's too late.        
        - What?                 

651
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,097
     Too many people            
     know about it already.     

652
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,299
           Who knows?           

653
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:44,967
        The Advertiser.         

654
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,304
           They know.           

655
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,573
  Oh, you're aye independent,   
  Thomas.                       

656
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,978
      (# Pop music plays)       

657
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:01,284
  Aye. There's a lot of people  
  earn a shilling here.         

658
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,234
Have you thought what this could
do to you?                      

659
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,202
    - To me?                    
    - Aye. To you and yours.    

660
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,771
         Explain that.          

661
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,340
  I've always tried to behave   
  in a brotherly sort of way.   

662
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,208
  - I've always tried to help.  
  - Im trying lto help you...   

663
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,478
 But the moment you get an idea 
 into your head,                

664
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,680
you must write to the newspapers
about it.                       

665
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,249
It's part of my duty as         
technical adviser to this plant 

666
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,950
  to keep the public informed.  

667
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,920
   The public has got enough    
   on its plate.                

668
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,222
    You see, here, Thomas,      
    I'll be blunt with you.     

669
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,292
You are doing yourself no good. 

670
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,095
 You're aye complaining about   
 this, that or the other thing. 

671
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,297
  You complain about the local  
  authority.                    

672
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,199
Not just you, your daughter too.

673
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,667
      You complain about        
      the health service.       

674
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,669
     Now you're complaining     
     about the spa.             

675
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,905
  You have no consideration     
  for anyone else's opinions.   

676
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,274
You seem to have forgotten that 
you've got me to thank          

677
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,775
for your appointment at the spa.

678
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,977
- I was the best you could get. 
- True enough.                  

679
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,413
    And I did a lot of work     
    in developing it.           

680
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:07,417
 But it was the practical men   
 who initiated the big project. 

681
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,818
   When the right time came,    

682
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,121
    I and the council           
    took the matter in hand.    

683
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,456
   And look at the ruddy mess   
   you made of it.              

684
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,859
   Well, you only did it        
   to bolster your own egos.    

685
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,995
   Now we're getting down to    
   the tooth of it.             

686
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,498
 All you're wanting is to pick  
 a quarrel with your superiors. 

687
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,068
  You have no time for anyone   
  set in authority above you.   

688
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,937
    Any stick is good enough    
    to beat them with.          

689
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,972
  I'll tell you this, though.   

690
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,308
    You are not going to get    
    the better of me.           

691
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,744
   You have been indiscreet,    
   Thomas.                      

692
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,546
      All sorts of rumors       
      will get about            

693
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,182
 and rumors against established 
 authority are dangerous.       

694
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,518
     So is that water           
     you're bottling there.     

695
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,855
  It'll be necessary for you    
  to issue a public disclaimer  

696
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,491
   saying that after further    
   investigation,               

697
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,026
  you found that the condition  
  of the water                  

698
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,728
     is not as critical         
     as you first thought.      

699
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,798
    Do you really expect me     
    to do that?                 

700
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,233
              Yes.              

701
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,602
   Oh, well, sorry. I can't.    

702
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,838
  And you'll never bend it by   
  tickling. That's my opinion.  

703
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,209
  As a private individual,      
  you can think what you like.  

704
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,843
        As our employee,        

705
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,646
 you have no right              
 to express any personal views. 

706
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,248
     I've a moral duty to.      

707
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,816
      Not on any subject        
      concerning the spa.       

708
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,652
          I forbid it!          

709
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,287
         You forbid it?         

710
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,955
You oblige me to take that tone.

711
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,925
    And you really expect me    
    to issue a statement        

712
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,594
saying that I don't know my job?

713
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:30,065
Aye. Some statement on the lines
I indicated.                    

714
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:34,069
 Well, you know perfectly well  
 that I won't do that. I can't! 

715
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,572
   Well, that's unfortunate,    
   Thomas.                      

716
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,909
Because I have some influence   
with the regional medical board.

717
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,712
I could have your license taken 
off you.                        

718
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,147
          Car or dog?           

719
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,281
     You know what I mean.      

720
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,882
  They'll stop you dispensing.  

721
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,418
        On what grounds?        

722
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,886
    You don't keep              
    to the stipulated hours.    

723
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,822
 I go over them. That's legal.  

724
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,524
  And what about your amateur   
  doctoring?                    

725
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,359
    Oh, I know what goes on.    

726
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,461
  A few pills here,             
  a bottle of medicine there.   

727
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,796
         - Doctors...           
         - Frown on it.         

728
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:05,335
One little slip-up, one wrong   
diagnosis and you'd be finished.

729
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:09,038
 - It's never happened.         
 - Are you saying it couldn't?  

730
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:14,344
My God, you've sunk pretty low. 

731
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:18,948
   I will use any means I can   
   to make you see reason.      

732
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,986
  It's not just you. It's       
  your family I'm thinking of.  

733
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,921
 Leave them out. It's the town  
 I'm thinking of.               

734
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,222
      You'll do it no good      

735
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:29,525
  by cutting off its principal  
  sources of income.            

736
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,193
  What kind of an income is it  

737
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,728
    that thrives on the sale    
    of corruption?              

738
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,565
 You should be ashamed to make  
 offensive remarks like that    

739
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,600
  about the town                
  that gives your livelihood.   

740
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:42,071
 Perhaps I should say gave you  
 a livelihood.                  

741
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,106
   And with no help from me,    

742
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,075
   you'll soon find yourself    
   without customers            

743
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:50,079
 when the people hear you've    
 ruined the town's prosperity.  

744
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,349
        - He said that?         
        - Arrogant pig.         

745
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,050
   What are you going to do?    

746
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,219
He's not gonna get away with it.

747
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,920
  - Good.                       
  - He's got power behind him.  

748
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,457
 And I've got power behind me.  
 I've got the people behind me. 

749
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,393
 I've got the press behind me.  

750
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,495
      But you can't fight       
      your own brother.         

751
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:09,264
Do you not want me to stand up  
for what I believe to be right? 

752
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,401
   - Of course. He's got to.    
   - It'll do you no good.      

753
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,537
   I've done my duty. I'm not   
   thinking of myself.          

754
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,372
   You're not thinking about    
   your family either.          

755
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,140
           Oh, Mum...           

756
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,610
  - Don't worry about me, Dad.  
  - I'm sorry, Katherine.       

757
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:23,045
     I'm not gonna give in      
     to blackmail.              

758
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,251
         It's red-hot.          

759
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,886
   He does have a persuasive    
   literary style.              

760
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,656
   "There can be no conflict    
   of interests.                

761
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,525
 "My public duty must outweigh  

762
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,126
    "any filial                 
    or commercial loyalty."     

763
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,729
(Woman) Mr. Houston? Telephone. 

764
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,097
   I've made one or two cuts.   

765
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,601
  It'll save us                 
  half a dozen libel actions.   

766
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:48,804
    Houston.                    
    Oh, hello, Mr. Stockman.    

767
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,940
  Do I take it you've run into  
  that brick wall?              

768
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,975
   He's got to let us use it.   

769
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,244
       That's good news.        

770
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,350
Good God. That's going a bit far
even for him.                   

771
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:03,919
   Mmm. What? Yeah.             
   We'll be seeing you, then?   

772
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,889
    Right. Goodbye just now.    

773
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,297
 - OK, the fight is on.         
 - Good. It'll start something. 

774
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,765
 But we've got to follow it up. 

775
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,900
  They won't fall down at the   
  first blast of the trumpet.   

776
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,370
But if the provost and the      
council sit back and do nothing,

777
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,473
     the rate-payers            
     will want to know why.     

778
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,107
  The council sank a lot        
  of their money in the plant.  

779
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,276
   But it's the shareholders    
   who get the profit.          

780
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,211
      It won't take             
      the rate-payers long      

781
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,514
   to detect the faint,         
   sweet smell of corruption.   

782
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,816
      Do you know,              
      I get the impression      

783
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,018
   our provost's in             
   a very satisfactory mess.    

784
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,589
I had to give it to the papers. 

785
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,924
       That Houston man's       
       just using you.          

786
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,226
    - I'm using him.            
    - He's a rabble-rouser.     

787
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,995
        That's just what        
        this town needs.        

788
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,597
    Well, I don't trust him.    

789
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,965
 He's on Dad's side. You heard  
 what he said yesterday.        

790
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,001
  He wants public recognition   
  for Dad.                      

791
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,636
    You're easily taken in.     

792
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,006
 And so are you, Tom.           
 It's happened time and again.  

793
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,375
   You've a better brain than   
   anybody else in this town    

794
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,076
      but anybody can make      
      a fool of you.            

795
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,645
    That's the kind of thing    
    Peter would say.            

796
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,680
    You're beginning to talk    
    like him.                   

797
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,281
       Thanks very much.        

798
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,119
  Are you gonna make the tea?   

799
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,955
 It's not too late to stop them 
 printing the report.           

800
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,223
I wish you'd go and see Houston.

801
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,758
              Dad?              

802
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,330
   All right. I'll go and see   
   Houston                      

803
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:21,731
  and you go and make the tea.  

804
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,065
      - (Peggy) You can't.      
      - Be quiet.               

805
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,234
   Is there any shortbread? I   
   didnae get my dinner.        

806
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,570
   - Did you really mean it?    
   - What, to see Houston?      

807
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,373
        Cross my heart.         

808
00:38:37,414 --> 00:38:38,948
  What's the matter with you?   

809
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,183
     Well, I never thought      
     I'd see the day.           

810
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,586
  You convinced me I should go  
  and see Houston.              

811
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,087
             I did?             

812
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,489
   Public recognition.          
   All that sort of nonsense.   

813
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,258
    I'll put a stop to that.    

814
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,593
So you're going to let him print
the report?                     

815
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,129
   Absolutely. And give him     
   ammunition for the battle.   

816
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,964
           Fantastic!           

817
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,304
  It's strong meat, Geikie.     
  I hope it doesn't alarm you.  

818
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,508
  Oh, I've no objection to      
  strong meat, Mr. Carmichael.  

819
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,944
      That's the stuff.         
      Hit hard and often.       

820
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,547
  - Aye, but with moderation.   
  - Moderation, aye.            

821
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,282
    All the incompetents        
    are gonna be kicked out,    

822
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,885
     and we're gonna put in     
     honest, vigorous men.      

823
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,153
This article is just the weapon 
we've been looking for.         

824
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,856
 Tom Stockman's gonna be useful 
 all right.                     

825
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,025
    It'll be fine               
    if he sticks to the spa     

826
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,729
 but I don't think it would be  
 wise to follow him further.    

827
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:30,733
  Geikie, I detect a distinct   
  tinge of yellow in you.       

828
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,869
   I'll thank you not to make   
   personal remarks             

829
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,136
      about my appearance.      

830
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,605
  It's all right, Mr. Geikie.   

831
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,408
  It just means perhaps you're  
  inclined to be overcautious.  

832
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,776
    Oh, aye. I'm a bit timid    

833
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,911
   when it comes to offending   
   the authorities.             

834
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,246
 I'm an older man than you are, 
 Mr. Carmichael,                

835
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,415
     and I've found             
     it doesn't always pay.     

836
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,720
- Nothing more you want me for? 
- Not at the moment.            

837
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,254
             Fine.              

838
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,863
  Look, I know he's the father  
  of the chapel and all that,   

839
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,632
  but can't we keep out of the  
  editorial side?               

840
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,000
     It's not that simple.      

841
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:06,902
I'm bloody fed up with all this 
card-carrying business.         

842
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,303
  You seem to let him get away  
  with it.                      

843
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,805
 Geikie has a lot of influence. 

844
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,875
He's got a finger in every pie. 
Unions, rate-payers, the lot.   

845
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,144
- In a small town, that's good. 
- I realize that.               

846
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,213
       There's something        
       you don't know.          

847
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,581
 That time we nearly went bust  
 cos we couldn't pay bonuses.   

848
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,052
It was Geikie who persuaded     
the workforce here to carry on. 

849
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,655
   Even now, if he insists on   
   higher rates                 

850
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,257
and withdraws his labor,        
we have to put up the shutters. 

851
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,859
         But surely...          

852
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,728
   I'm perpetually balancing    
   on a knife edge.             

853
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,630
   A few issues not published   
   could finish me.             

854
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,432
 And the workforce. They'd only 
 be cutting their noses off     

855
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:39,001
     to spite their faces.      

856
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:43,038
One of the big newspaper groups 
is waiting for just that to     
happen,                         

857
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,674
   to take over this part of    
   Scotland.                    

858
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,841
    They'll snap this one up    

859
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,777
and the workers will be kept on 
with higher wages.              

860
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:53,515
   - Oh, I didn't know that.    
   - You know now.              

861
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,851
   So, I'm afraid we'll have    
   to carry on with this.       

862
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,619
    Excuse me, Mr. Houston.     

863
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,621
      Mr. Stockman's here,      
      the other one.            

864
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,157
  The provost?                  
  What the hell does he want?   

865
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,526
   He wants a word with you.    

866
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:05,160
   I don't think he wants to    
   be seen.                     

867
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:07,162
       He came in through       
       the case room.           

868
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,563
    All right, send him in.     

869
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:11,133
 Oh, Mr. Geikie? See we're not  
 interrupted, will you?         

870
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,804
   (Geikie) Do come through,    
   please.                      

871
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,973
 It's the provost, Mr. Houston. 

872
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,141
   Good evening, Mr. Houston.   

873
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,876
      You'll be surprised       
      to see me here.           

874
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:24,279
Yes, we didn't expect you. Have 
we got a chair for the provost? 

875
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,449
   You've very snug in here,    
   Mr. Carmichael.              

876
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,985
It serves its purpose, Provost. 
It serves its purpose.          

877
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,154
 Long may it continue to do so. 

878
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,123
           Thank you.           

879
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,457
  A free and flourishing press  

880
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,793
      is an essential part      
      of the community.         

881
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,529
 And here I come, Mr. Houston,  
 without notice,                

882
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,931
     to take up your time.      

883
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,633
     Well, we're delighted      
     to see you.                

884
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,802
    I've had a very annoying    
    experience today.           

885
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,370
  Sorry to hear that, Provost.  

886
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,541
  Was your civic lunch          
  not up to standard, Provost?  

887
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:54,043
   My brother was responsible   
   for the incident.            

888
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,410
           - Really?            
           - Mm.                

889
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,212
 He submitted a kind of report  

890
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:01,083
about certain alleged defects   
in the water supply to the spa. 

891
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,886
- Indeed.                       
- Did he not tell you about it? 

892
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,388
  - I thought he said...        
  - Yes, he did say something.  

893
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,957
  John, do you remember about   
  a report...                   

894
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,159
   I'm sorry to trouble you,    
   Mr. Houston,                 

895
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:13,028
 but I forgot to take the copy  
 with me.                       

896
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,500
     I can read it              
     during the tea break.      

897
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:23,939
  Mr. Geikie. Is that, by any   
  chance, my brother's report?  

898
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,407
          Aye, it is.           

899
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,310
  Mr. Houston and I             
  were just chatting about it.  

900
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,013
  - I take it you've read it.   
  - I've glanced through it.    

901
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,748
      - You'll publish it?      
      - Why not?                

902
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,150
  - Well...                     
  - Just a minute, Mr. Geikie.  

903
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,220
 - You don't mind, Mr. Houston? 
 - No, not at all.              

904
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,056
    You have the reputation     

905
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:45,294
of being an intelligent         
and thoughtful man, Mr. Geikie. 

906
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,829
     It's very kind of you      
     to say that, Provost.      

907
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,899
   And a man of considerable    
   influence, eh?               

908
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,867
     I'm just a voice           
     of the citizenry, sir.     

909
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,869
   I've no doubt you're aware   

910
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,138
of the general trend of opinion 
among them.                     

911
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,973
        I believe I am.         

912
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:02,177
  Aye. It's evidence of         
  an excellent public spirit.   

913
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,881
     Mind you, it'll be no      
     small sacrifice            

914
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,482
    the people of this town     
    are going to make.          

915
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,684
           Sacrifice?           

916
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,253
I don't think we understand you,
Provost.                        

917
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,022
 Are you talking about the spa? 

918
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:17,726
 I would make a rough estimate  
 of £150,000                    

919
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,561
 to put the water supply right. 

920
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,131
      - 150,000?                
      - Aye. More or less.      

921
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,466
  It'll make a big difference   
  to the rates.                 

922
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,869
           The rates?           

923
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,971
 Good God, don't say the town's 
 going to pay for it?           

924
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,740
  Where else do you expect it   
  to come from?                 

925
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,307
     Not from the tannery?      

926
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,710
    There's no hard evidence    
    that they're the source.    

927
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,747
     The bottling plant         
     is a private company.      

928
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:40,449
 Surely the shareholders        
 would have to find the money.  

929
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,584
 - Exactly. Good point, Geikie. 
 - No, no, no.                  

930
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,686
     They're in no position     
     to find it.                

931
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,257
 And they've already incurred   
 a substantial capital outlay.  

932
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:52,494
  Let's remember that they are  
  good Baikie men.              

933
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,564
But if they're pushed too far,  
they may be forced to sell out. 

934
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,366
      To London, perhaps.       

935
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:02,404
Well, that puts a different kind
of complexion on things.        

936
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,407
Nevertheless, Geikie,           
that report has to be published.

937
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,611
  It'll mean closing the spa.   
  And the tannery.              

938
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,213
And we'll not get many visitors 

939
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,917
 if we announce that the water  
 supply is contaminated.        

940
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:18,720
And frankly, Mr. Houston, it'll 
hardly improve your circulation 

941
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,123
if you're seen to be advocating 
unemployment                    

942
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,759
 and an increase in the rates.  

943
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,528
 Is it possible, do you think,  
 Provost,                       

944
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,999
   that Mr. Stockman has been   
   exaggerating this thing      

945
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,734
           a wee bit?           

946
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:36,071
 I must confess, I find myself  
 driven to that conclusion.     

947
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:40,142
   Indeed. You might even say   
   that he's been...            

948
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,144
   imagining the whole thing,   
   so to speak.                 

949
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,314
      The possibility           
      had occurred to me.       

950
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:49,418
 Well, I must say, I think that 
 very remiss of Mr. Stockman.   

951
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,822
You'll excuse me speaking about 
your brother in this way.       

952
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:55,624
 I'm a great believer in        
 moderation, as you well know,  

953
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,360
- but in the circumstances...   
- I take no offence, Mr. Geikie.

954
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,163
    My brother has aye been     
    headstrong.                 

955
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:06,001
I've tried to curb his excesses 
but it hasn't always been easy. 

956
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,604
  Difficult position for you,   
  Provost. I can see that.      

957
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:13,475
You won't want to take this     
matter any further, Mr. Houston?

958
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,980
   Of course we bloody will!    

959
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:19,982
   Now listen to me, Geikie.    

960
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:22,517
   Tom Stockman may be right    
   or he may be wrong.          

961
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,854
 The only way to find out       
 is to publish that damn report 

962
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,989
    and have the whole thing    
    thrashed out in public.     

963
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,591
All due respect to you, Provost,

964
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,693
     but we cannot suppress     
     that report                

965
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,964
   just because you disagree    
   with your brother.           

966
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,465
    It's not quite as simple    
    as that.                    

967
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:40,669
 You see, once this thing       
 gets out, the town is ruined.  

968
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:45,741
 If that thing doesn't get out  
 and is proved to be right,     

969
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,243
this town will be really ruined.

970
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,145
    In the meantime,            
    we must leave ourselves     

971
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,014
  in the hands of the provost.  

972
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:54,716
 He wouldn't say his brother    
 was imagining the whole thing  

973
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,886
if he didn't think it was true. 

974
00:45:56,888 --> 00:46:00,355
 Don't you agree, Mr. Houston?  

975
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,125
      Well, good God, man.      
      Of course you don't!      

976
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,060
    I'm afraid I will have      
    to put it to my members     

977
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,029
      that it might not be      
      in the interest           

978
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:08,730
     of the ordinary people     
     of this town               

979
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,666
      to publish such           
      a dangerous report.       

980
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,937
     And while I was making     
     that proposition,          

981
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,973
      all labor would have      
      to be withdrawn.          

982
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,549
    I'll be in the case room    
    if you need me.             

983
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,919
          John? John?           

984
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:36,358
    Oh, well. I'll be off to    
    my work, Provost.           

985
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,293
    It was very good of you     

986
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,229
      to straighten us out      
      in this matter.           

987
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:42,164
        A painful duty.         

988
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,299
              Aye.              

989
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,567
       We'll get together       
       and sort this out.       

990
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,001
       I bloody hope so.        

991
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:49,204
    It's a sensitive area.      
    You don't understand...     

992
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,539
    I understand, all right.    

993
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,807
     It gives me a pain         
     in my sensitive area.      

994
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,410
 Now, look. I've had small-town 
 politics up to here.           

995
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,813
If you want to placate those    
two bastards then you may do so,

996
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,349
      but without my help.      

997
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,284
     I'll sort this out.        
     Just leave it with me.     

998
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,957
I've drawn up a short statement,
Mr. Houston.                    

999
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,758
     It indicates the board     

1000
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,961
    is always on the lookout    
    for possible defects        

1001
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,996
     and will not hesitate      
     to put anything right      

1002
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,732
       without incurring        
       too much expense.        

1003
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,067
   Have you got it with you?    

1004
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,902
        As it happens...        

1005
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,142
        Ah. Carmichael.         

1006
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,743
          Now, this...          

1007
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,414
  Mr. Houston? The other one.   

1008
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:37,486
       Well, well, Peter.       

1009
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,122
I'm surprised at you coming here
behind my back.                 

1010
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:42,091
   I'm sorry to trouble you,    
   Mr. Houston,                 

1011
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,992
but I thought we should include 
some statistics.                

1012
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,661
        It's no trouble.        

1013
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,263
You know I had a number of      
customers with chrome poisoning.

1014
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,933
There'd be no names, of course. 
No means of identification.     

1015
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,334
         It's an idea.          

1016
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,503
But can we talk about it later? 
We're very busy now.            

1017
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:58,907
 As you wish, but...there's one 
 other thing                    

1018
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,410
      that I thought            
      I'd mention to you.       

1019
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,945
  You know what the folk here   
  are like.                     

1020
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,081
     They're a good bunch       
     in the main and, er...     

1021
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,518
 Well, so far as I know,        
 they think quite highly of me. 

1022
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,686
    Oh, they do indeed, sir.    
    They do indeed.             

1023
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:13,922
           - So far.            
           - Exactly.           

1024
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,158
    So I thought                
    when this became public,    

1025
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,294
 they might feel                
 they should make some gesture. 

1026
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,596
           Look, Tom.           

1027
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:23,098
    I can't hide it from you    
    any longer.                 

1028
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,234
    No, I won't hear of it.     

1029
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,469
    If anything of that sort    
    is being planned...         

1030
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,171
     Anything of what sort?     

1031
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:32,407
      Well, I don't know.       
      I mean, anything.         

1032
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,975
    I mean, whatever it is,     

1033
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,877
   you must give me your word   
   you'll put a stop to it.     

1034
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,647
  Don't think I'm ungrateful,   
  I appreciate it very much,    

1035
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,316
    but I have done nothing     
    except my duty.             

1036
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,020
       See this, Houston?       

1037
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:48,657
   - The symbol of office.      
   - For God's sake, Thomas.    

1038
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,492
    The symbol, not the man.    

1039
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,926
     If I was to open this,     

1040
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:54,128
  I wouldn't find a small lie   
  or a tiny hypocrisy           

1041
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,798
  or even the slightest whiff   
  of corruption.                

1042
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,032
      But if I was to open      
      its owner...              

1043
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:00,569
   Would you please put down    
   my umbrella?                 

1044
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,373
 You've been wasting your time, 
 Peter,                         

1045
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,909
 if you've come to try and stop 
 Houston publishing my report.  

1046
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:12,647
 And does Mr. Houston           
 intend to publish your report? 

1047
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,285
          No, I don't.          

1048
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,354
  That's what I've been trying  
  to tell you.                  

1049
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,925
   I don't quite understand.    

1050
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:27,362
   Well, he's not gonna ruin    
   himself and his paper        

1051
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,563
  and the people of this town   

1052
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,699
    for the sake of             
    an imaginary grievance.     

1053
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,134
What's all this about, Houston? 

1054
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,336
   You've given us              
   a highly-colored account.    

1055
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:35,504
   What do you mean by that?    

1056
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,906
  Your report                   
  exaggerates the whole thing.  

1057
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,310
       I'm not asking you       
       to understand it.        

1058
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,845
  Just publish it. Leave the    
  explaining to me afterwards.  

1059
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,015
        Sorry. I can't.         

1060
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,016
   What? You own this paper.    
   Carmichael edits it.         

1061
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,085
    Between the two of you,     
    you control it.             

1062
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:54,022
 That's not quite true, sir.    
 It's controlled by the public. 

1063
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,790
   Public opinion, of course.   

1064
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,494
  The opinion of the men        
  and the women of this town.   

1065
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:01,363
  - They would be against me?   
  - Oh, aye, they would.        

1066
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:02,964
   They've changed their tune   
   very quickly.                

1067
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:06,301
It would mean disaster for them 
if your report got out.         

1068
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,303
    Economically, maybe,        
    but a physical disaster     

1069
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,172
    for thousands of others     
    if it doesn't.              

1070
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,510
    Is this final, Houston?     

1071
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,746
         I'm afraid so.         

1072
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,314
     The official statement     

1073
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,850
will appear in Saturday's issue,
Mr. Houston.                    

1074
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,318
              Yes.              

1075
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,123
    Well, I'll get my report    
    published privately.        

1076
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,525
        And distributed.        

1077
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,228
You won't find it easy          
to get it printed in this town. 

1078
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,964
  I'll hold a public meeting.   
  I'll tell everyone about it.  

1079
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,001
 - Are you a gardener, Houston? 
 - No.                          

1080
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,004
   Ah, but you've maybe heard   
   of black spot.               

1081
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,607
    It's a fungus               
    that attacks the leaves     

1082
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:49,978
 and eventually spreads         
 and destroys the whole plant.  

1083
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,280
      Well, it seems to me      

1084
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,515
  that there's more than roses  
  are prone to it.              

1085
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,588
  Great things are done         
  when men and mountains meet.  

1086
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,891
   And this is not done         
   by jostling in the street.   

1087
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,693
        Small mountain.         

1088
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,095
 Blake might have considered it 
 big enough.                    

1089
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,301
Imagine your father not getting 
anywhere else to speak          

1090
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,403
         but out here.          

1091
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,004
  What's everybody afraid of?   

1092
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,040
 I'm not surprised. After all,  
 it's a controversial subject.  

1093
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,810
 In circumstances like this,    
 people are a wee bit nervous.  

1094
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,012
  (Peggy) So am I. I'm glad to  
  have someone around           

1095
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,814
     in case they               
     start throwing things.     

1096
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,282
  Let's stand by the archway.   

1097
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,618
    We can make a quick exit    
    if things get too brisk.    

1098
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,720
  You don't think there'll be   
  trouble, do you?              

1099
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,922
    You can never tell          
    with a crowd like this.     

1100
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:37,426
  (Captain) I see they're all   
  here, eh?                     

1101
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:40,929
    (Applause and cheering)     

1102
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,373
       - Can you hear me?       
       - Yes!                   

1103
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:55,644
 Ah, well, look. It's 5:15.     
 I think we should just begin.  

1104
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,512
     (Tom) There's no point     
     in waiting...              

1105
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,248
     Would it not be better     
     to elect a chairman?       

1106
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,752
         - (Tom) What?          
         - (All agree)          

1107
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:07,088
I think it would maybe be as    
well for us to have a chairman. 

1108
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,523
        (Tom) All right,        
        have a chairman.        

1109
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,260
If you want to have a chairman, 
pick who you like.              

1110
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:15,697
    The provost will accept     
    the responsibility.         

1111
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,001
   For various reasons,         
   I must ask to be excused.    

1112
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:23,271
 But I'm sure we would all find 
 Mr. Geikie acceptable.         

1113
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,040
    (Applause and cheering)     

1114
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,954
     Brothers and sisters.      

1115
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,923
          (All cheer)           

1116
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,992
This is a                       
democratically-convened meeting 

1117
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,662
 on a matter of public concern. 

1118
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:50,799
  And I hope that we can give   
  a full and frank discussion   

1119
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:53,167
    to the issues involved.     

1120
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:56,738
Within the bounds of moderation,
of course.                      

1121
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,206
    (Man) Up the moderates!     

1122
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,910
   I'll have no interruptions   
   from you, if you please.     

1123
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,814
   Now, the chair recognizes    
   the provost.                 

1124
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,054
   The provost has the floor.   

1125
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,694
   Fellow citizens of Baikie.   

1126
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,530
      My friends, I hope.       

1127
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,865
   You all know that I stand    
   in close relationship        

1128
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,000
    to the technical adviser    
    of the spa.                 

1129
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,636
       He is my brother.        

1130
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:29,604
I would therefore have preferred
not to take part                

1131
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,740
      in this discussion.       

1132
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,374
    But my official position    

1133
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,779
and my concern for the interests
of the town compel me to.       

1134
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,447
  I think my statement in The   
  Advertiser                    

1135
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,382
       puts the position        
       plainly and simply       

1136
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,619
   so that any fair-minded      
   son or daughter of Baikie    

1137
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,488
can form his or her own opinion.

1138
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,490
      But I'm bound to add      

1139
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,459
    that the expert view is     

1140
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,495
  that my brother's proposals   
  would saddle the rate-payers  

1141
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:57,666
with the unnecessary expenditure
of a very large sum of money.   

1142
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,537
 I feel it is my duty           
 to save you from that burden.  

1143
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:05,840
           (Applause)           

1144
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:11,680
I vacate the chair to say that I
personally support the provost. 

1145
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,015
    There is more behind his    
    brother's ideas             

1146
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,049
     than you might think.      

1147
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:16,951
        (Man shouts out)        

1148
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,188
 I'm not saying he doesn't mean 
 well. No two ways about that.  

1149
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,925
   And I am all for the free    
   expression of opinion        

1150
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,795
       as long as it is         
       a moderate opinion       

1151
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:29,298
and doesn't do anybody any harm.

1152
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,365
 But nobody is going to tell me 

1153
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:34,068
       that his opinion         
       is a moderate one        

1154
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:39,373
if it means a rise in the rates 
and in the unemployment.        

1155
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,614
   You can pay too dearly for   
   some things.                 

1156
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,049
    (Man) Shut up and get on    
    with it, Geikie.            

1157
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,718
      The chair recognizes      
      Mr. Houston.              

1158
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:54,155
     Come on, Houston.          
     Let's get your views.      

1159
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,191
   Mr. Houston has the floor.   

1160
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:58,226
 (Man) Current views, that is!  

1161
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,061
     Thank you, Mr. Geikie.     

1162
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,932
   (Clears throat) Ladies and   
   gentlemen.                   

1163
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,034
      I hope this meeting       
      is in no doubt            

1164
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:09,838
about the honesty and           
independence of The Advertiser. 

1165
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,276
  We try to make our political  
  attitude objective.           

1166
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,046
       We try to be fair        
       to all parties.          

1167
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,481
  And we always try to reflect  
  public opinion.               

1168
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,884
     That is the first duty     
     of a newspaper.            

1169
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,886
      (Crowd) Hear, hear!       

1170
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,554
 There can be very little doubt 

1171
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,723
   where public opinion lies    
   in this matter.              

1172
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:31,693
Against any substantial increase
in the rates.                   

1173
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,695
    (Applause and cheering)     

1174
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,598
  I say all this with regret.   

1175
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,533
   I've personally always had   
   the greatest respect         

1176
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,168
    for Mr. Thomas Stockman.    

1177
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:45,807
 Nevertheless, my duty to my    
 paper, and to you, the public, 

1178
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,909
   has compelled me to break    
   with it. Thank you.          

1179
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,844
           (Applause)           

1180
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:55,417
  I will now put the provost's  
  motion to the fore.           

1181
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:56,918
    No, no, Geikie.             
    Enough of that nonsense.    

1182
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,821
   I ask you to show respect    
   for the chair.               

1183
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,856
     Shut up, Geikie.           
     Give the man a chance!     

1184
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,891
          Hear, hear.           

1185
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,493
      The voice of reason.      

1186
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:06,160
  Mr. Stockman has the floor.   

1187
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,029
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1188
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,198
     There will be no vote      
     here tonight.              

1189
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,104
     Wee, sleekit, cow'rin,     
     tim'rous beastie...        

1190
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,540
 (Man) Come on. Get on with it! 

1191
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,843
  The water supply is poisoned  
  and our curative spa...       

1192
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,377
      That's a bloody lie!      

1193
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,413
     I've been drinking it      
     since I was a boy.         

1194
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,382
..that is what they won't admit.

1195
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:31,019
   But I've no bond with such   
   a trivial matter.            

1196
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,888
       Because once your        
       elected leaders          

1197
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,857
   have had a certain amount    
   of profit out of it,         

1198
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,860
that matter will be attended to 
with your money                 

1199
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:42,664
   by some nameless, faceless   
   overpaid bureaucrat          

1200
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,165
    from somewhere or other.    

1201
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,100
But that too is a trivial matter

1202
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:48,336
   compared with what I have    
   discovered.                  

1203
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,005
       I have discovered        

1204
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:55,509
  that the very sources of our  
  spiritual life is poisoned.   

1205
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:57,011
     That the whole fabric      
     of our society             

1206
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,647
     is infected with lies      
     and deceit.                

1207
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,382
         (Crowd uproar)         

1208
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,751
    If we don't do something    
    about it,                   

1209
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,185
 you'll all be dead as a dodo.  

1210
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,387
     (All shouting angrily)     

1211
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,122
   All right, brother Geikie.   

1212
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,858
    I'll stick to the point     
    as you call it.             

1213
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,461
 And my point is that suddenly  
 in these last few days,        

1214
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,263
   my eyes have been opened,    

1215
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,798
     and the first thing        
     I have become aware of     

1216
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,701
 is the overwhelming stupidity  
 of the authorities.            

1217
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:22,703
     And I do not know how,     
     for so long,               

1218
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:26,074
 I should have believed         
 that these were dedicated men  

1219
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:28,343
    with our best interests     
    in front of them.           

1220
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:30,511
    But I did believe that.     

1221
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:33,347
 I did believe that there were  
 men who wanted a society       

1222
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,617
   in which a man could live    
   as a man                     

1223
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,019
     rather than an animal.     

1224
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,688
   Hey, Jimmy,                  
   Is he calling us animals?    

1225
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,623
 (Chants) # We are the animals! 

1226
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,224
         (Claps hands)          

1227
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:46,394
    # We are the animals! #     

1228
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:47,929
     They're no' dedicated      
     to anything                

1229
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,532
except their own self-interest. 

1230
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,968
      And I don't know why      

1231
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,972
     it's taken us so long      
     to find this out.          

1232
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,676
 Because day in, day out, I've  
 had living right under my nose 

1233
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:05,780
 a prime example of their kind! 

1234
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,749
       Your own provost.        

1235
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,785
      The one you elected.      
      My brother Peter.         

1236
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:14,122
   (Man) You're out of order,   
   Mr. Stockman!                

1237
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,990
     I'm no' bothered about     
     your leading citizens.     

1238
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:22,230
They're all planted with the    
seeds of their own destruction. 

1239
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:26,334
   And they are not the ones    
   who are poisoning            

1240
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,470
     the very sources           
     of our spiritual life.     

1241
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,843
   The most dangerous persons   
   in our community             

1242
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,078
      to truth and freedom      

1243
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,549
are the ones who put them there.

1244
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,784
 - Who are they?                
 - What are you talking about?  

1245
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,920
  Of course I will name them.   

1246
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:47,756
That is precisely why I am here.

1247
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:50,592
   The most dangerous enemies   
   of truth and freedom         

1248
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:53,094
        in our community        

1249
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,629
            are you,            

1250
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,731
         the majority.          

1251
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:01,569
   The damn silent majority.    
   You are responsible!         

1252
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,405
 The majority is always right,  
 Stockman.                      

1253
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,407
    That is the fundamental     
    principle of democracy.     

1254
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:10,411
  Aye, you heard Mr. Houston.   
  It's fundamental all right.   

1255
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:15,116
   It's fundamental trickery.   

1256
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,152
      And it is also            
      the most obvious lie      

1257
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:20,755
      that any individual       
      free-thinking man         

1258
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,291
   has got to fight against.    

1259
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,326
  Well, who are the majority?   

1260
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:30,331
All over the world, there is a  
majority of fools over wise men.

1261
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:36,404
 How then can it be right       
 for fools to govern wise men?  

1262
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,407
Tom, Tom. Yesterday you were    
fighting for a good cause.      

1263
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,810
    Now you're talking like     
    a bloody fascist, man.      

1264
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:46,080
Yesterday, Carmichael,          
you walked out on a good cause. 

1265
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,182
 I walked out on censorship of  
 the press.                     

1266
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:52,186
   Censorship?                  
   Censorship by Mr. Houston.   

1267
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,588
             Right!             

1268
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,224
  And yet he's supposed to be   
  a revolutionary agitator.     

1269
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,326
      Prove... Prove that!      

1270
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,895
    When did I ever say that    
    in my paper?                

1271
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,863
  You're attacking everything   
  and everybody.                

1272
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,832
     It seems to me you're      
     the revolutionary.         

1273
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:08,602
 My God, for once you're right. 

1274
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:11,639
   I'm starting a revolution    
   against the lie              

1275
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:15,409
  that truth and the majority   
  go hand in hand.              

1276
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:19,547
What kind of truths do the      
majority generally rally around?

1277
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:22,751
   Meaningless catchphrases.    

1278
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,986
      Because that's what       
      their leaders want.       

1279
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,522
  Their leaders do not want to  
  declare the victory.          

1280
01:00:27,524 --> 01:00:29,057
They want the battle to continue

1281
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:32,360
 because they believe that the  
 continuation of a state of war 

1282
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,262
     is to their advantage.     

1283
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:36,998
 And far less do those leaders  

1284
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,835
  have the vision to see        
  the new horizons of thought.  

1285
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:44,939
 That is something that is only 
 given to a brilliant few.      

1286
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:48,843
  Keir Hardie was such a man.   

1287
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,478
      You keep Keir Hardie      
      out of this.              

1288
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,146
     What do you know about     
     Keir Hardie?               

1289
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,016
  Keir Hardie won the battle.   

1290
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,219
  Now, a hundred years later,   
  brother Geikie and his like   

1291
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,822
   are picking over corpses.    

1292
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:07,262
The new horizons are far, far   
ahead of their miserable vision.

1293
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,833
   Listen to me, my friends.    

1294
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,802
     You are not so stupid      

1295
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,438
    as to think that it was     
    the majorities              

1296
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,941
    who achieved advances       
    in the field of science.    

1297
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:23,745
   You cannae be that stupid.   

1298
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:27,548
And all I'm saying to you       
is that in the political arena, 

1299
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,184
       in the management        
       of our society,          

1300
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,522
      it will be one man,       
      one Keir Hardie,          

1301
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:39,393
one brilliant individual leader 
of thought                      

1302
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,931
     who will reveal to you     
     the new horizons.          

1303
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:47,135
    The majority tramples       
    the individual underfoot    

1304
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:49,437
      while you search for      
      the truths of today.      

1305
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,940
       The majorities           
       all over the world       

1306
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:56,010
      have to trample           
      all the individuals       

1307
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:59,447
  under a million brutal feet.  

1308
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,149
     Whose side are you on?     

1309
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,418
  I'm not on any side anymore.  
  No, no, no.                   

1310
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,754
       Don't you see?           
       I have to be free.       

1311
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:10,525
Your leaders want you on sides. 
One side against the other.     

1312
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,994
      Divide and conquer,       
      one of them said.         

1313
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:15,229
  And by God, they conquered.   

1314
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:19,433
 Some of them are stupid enough 
 to do it in his name.          

1315
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,370
 They conquered the individual. 

1316
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,974
   Trade unions, managements,   
   political parties,           

1317
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,641
       whatever you like.       

1318
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,944
      They have to conquer      
      the individual            

1319
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:33,181
       because they want        
       to get your brains       

1320
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:36,551
      and grind them            
      into a single mash,       

1321
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:40,388
  so you're no longer capable   
  of thinking for yourselves.   

1322
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,391
They pander to you on the telly 
and in the press                

1323
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:47,228
  so that you shall be their    
  majority. Theirs, mark you.   

1324
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,730
They do not want you to wake up 

1325
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:52,867
    and chuck the whole lot     
    of them out.                

1326
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:57,205
  Stockman out! Stockman out!   
  Stockman out!                 

1327
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,541
(Geikie) That's an exaggeration.

1328
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,010
  (Tom) I am not exaggerating!  

1329
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:04,678
   - They don't believe you.    
   - Of course they don't.      

1330
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,447
     They are the majority.     

1331
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,084
 The majority stifles the       
 conscience of the individual.  

1332
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:11,419
    The point, Mr. Stockman,    

1333
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:14,455
 that you want to close the spa 
 and ruin this town.            

1334
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,457
     It sounds unimportant.     

1335
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,359
  It's not unimportant to them  

1336
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,461
because they are not gonna ruin 
themselves.                     

1337
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,531
That is exactly what they are   
doing. That is the whole point. 

1338
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,667
       I mean, a majority       
       becomes the enemy        

1339
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:29,603
   of the individuals           
   who compose that majority.   

1340
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,507
    You are the enemy,          
    the enemy of the people,    

1341
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:35,009
    because you want to ruin    
    the town.                   

1342
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,146
I'd rather see it ruined        
than have it flourish on a lie. 

1343
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:42,082
 What does it matter if a lying 
 community is ruined?           

1344
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:46,187
    I mean, let it be razed     
    to the ground.              

1345
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:52,260
  Let all communities who live  
  by lies be exterminated.      

1346
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,434
 He's away. The bastard's away. 

1347
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:04,905
Aye. I'm gonna smash his windows
in! I'll teach him!             

1348
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:19,420
  Here. What's come over        
  the chemist, Mr. Carmichael?  

1349
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,988
 Suffering the fate of old men  

1350
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,556
   who swim against the tide,   
   Willie.                      

1351
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:26,027
Aye. They would rather have him,
is that it?                     

1352
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:01,195
    You see that? A pebble.     

1353
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,296
  Didn't even have the courage  

1354
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,798
to be full-blooded hooligans and
chuck bricks.                   

1355
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,667
   What did the joiners say?    

1356
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:11,706
   I phoned both of them.       
   Ben said he was too busy.    

1357
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,675
   McDowall was more honest.    

1358
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:17,278
  He said it was more than his  
  business was worth            

1359
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,612
 to do a job for you just now.  

1360
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,148
     I suppose he's right.      

1361
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,150
 We'll need to do a proper job  
 on this, though.               

1362
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,385
    - Can I have the shovel?    
    - Just a minute.            

1363
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:27,755
        Mind your hands.        

1364
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,290
    Well, Mr. Downy phoned.     

1365
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,126
He wants to terminate the lease 
at the end of the quarter.      

1366
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,895
     - He can't do that.        
     - Oh, I didnae argue.      

1367
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,597
           - Oh, Tom.           
           - No.                

1368
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,133
      I have been thinking      
      about Canada.             

1369
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,736
The air's fresher and a chemist 
can aye get work.               

1370
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:45,539
   We can't just up and away    
   like that.                   

1371
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,608
            Why not?            

1372
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,577
  We're not as young as were,   
  for a start.                  

1373
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,612
     And what about Peggy?      
     She'll not want to go.     

1374
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,714
     Oh, it's a great place     
     for teachers.              

1375
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,684
She's aye complaining           
about the education system here.

1376
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,920
Well, I think she'll have other 
reasons for wanting to stay.    

1377
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,922
   Well, you can't expect me    
   to stay.                     

1378
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:06,126
   This town...                 
   Well, they've insulted me.   

1379
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:09,030
   Called me an enemy of the    
   people. Broke my windows.    

1380
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:11,599
  Torn my best trousers.        
  Did I show you my trousers?   

1381
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,933
   Yes, dear, you showed me.    

1382
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:14,302
Aye, well, it's a lesson to me. 

1383
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,704
I'll never again go out to fight
for freedom                     

1384
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,040
and the rights of the individual
in my best trousers.            

1385
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,541
         I know, dear.          

1386
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,546
 Och... I'll sew them up again. 
 They'll be as good as new.     

1387
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,983
   What surprises me is their   
   ingratitude.                 

1388
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,019
   I know, and it's a shame.    

1389
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:33,187
     But you did give them      
     provocation.               

1390
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,390
  I told them the truth about   
  themselves                    

1391
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:36,624
    and they didnae like it.    

1392
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:39,627
       No, they did not.        

1393
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:42,296
Come on. I've got to get moving.
I'm still open for business.    

1394
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,332
        (Car horn beeps)        

1395
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,109
Guess what? I've been suspended.

1396
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:58,879
- Why?                          
- Because I used school property

1397
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,082
  to run off Dad's handbills.   

1398
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:03,251
   I've been to see Grandad.    
   He said to give you these.   

1399
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:06,654
            Cigars?             

1400
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:08,889
Here's Peter. I'll away and get 
you a tool box.                 

1401
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,257
  Are you going to the house,   
  Peggy?                        

1402
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,659
    Yes. I'll run you, Mum.     

1403
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:36,784
      Keep your bonnet on       
      and your brolly up.       

1404
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,652
      It's kind of drafty       
      in here today.            

1405
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,121
  I see you have a lot to do.   
  I won't keep you.             

1406
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,890
             Good.              

1407
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,860
 I'm sorry I wasn't able to put 
 a stop to that demonstration.  

1408
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,662
  Is that all you came in here  
  to say?                       

1409
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,433
    I have to give you this.    

1410
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,635
      That's a termination      
      of my services            

1411
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,270
as technical adviser to the spa.

1412
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,571
              Yes.              

1413
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,377
  Now, you'll excuse me.        
  I've got rather a lot to do.  

1414
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,086
  Are you expecting customers,  
  then?                         

1415
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:17,258
    Maybe, after sore heads     
    last night.                 

1416
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,260
If you'll take my advice, you'll
leave the district for a while. 

1417
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,996
  Funnily enough,               
  I was just thinking of that.  

1418
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:24,598
   In my own time, of course.   

1419
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,067
   That's the first sensible    
   decision                     

1420
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:29,036
  you've made for a long time.  

1421
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,672
   Maybe when you've had time   
   to think things over,        

1422
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,908
 you might be able to persuade  
 yourself to write an apology,  

1423
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,611
    perhaps admitting           
    that you made a mistake.    

1424
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,914
     Do you think maybe...      

1425
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:42,750
 I would get my job at the spa  
 back if I did that?            

1426
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,752
    Aye, it's just possible.    
    I can promise nothing       

1427
01:08:44,754 --> 01:08:47,321
but I'll do what I can for you. 

1428
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,757
 And what about public opinion? 

1429
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,092
   Public opinion               
   is a fickle thing, Thomas.   

1430
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,794
  You wouldnae go against it,   
  surely.                       

1431
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,797
There is no saying what the     
public will think in six months.

1432
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:01,535
And to be candid with you,      
it is of considerable importance

1433
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,737
that we should get some kind of 
written statement from you      

1434
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,239
        to that effect.         

1435
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:08,976
Aye, that's what you really came
in for, isn't it?               

1436
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,011
  But you've no chance, Peter.  

1437
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,947
  You'll never get a statement  
  like that out of me.          

1438
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,683
   You've no right to behave    
   like this, Thomas.           

1439
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:18,385
   It's no attitude for a man   
   with a family to take.       

1440
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,054
   I wouldn't have a shred of   
   self-respect                 

1441
01:09:20,056 --> 01:09:21,121
    if I did anything else.     

1442
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:22,556
        Very plausible -        

1443
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,725
if there were no other          
explanation for your obstinacy. 

1444
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,660
   - But there is, of course.   
   - Is there?                  

1445
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,395
   But if you take my advice,   

1446
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,397
   you'll not build too much    
   on your expectations.        

1447
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,099
They could very easily fail you.

1448
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,834
        My expectations?        

1449
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,769
  - You have a father-in-law?   
  - What about it?              

1450
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,606
 Sir Archie's well up in years. 
 He's been failing of late.     

1451
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,674
   And he is a comparatively    
   rich man.                    

1452
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,476
     Aye, I suppose he is.      

1453
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,377
  You can take my word for it,  

1454
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:45,846
and you can take my word for it 

1455
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,181
  that you and Katherine        
  are his principal legatees.   

1456
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:49,817
      I didn't know that.       

1457
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,585
- How did you?                  
- We don't need to go into that.

1458
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:52,787
      Another member            
      of the bridge club?       

1459
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,855
      After what happened       
      at that meeting,          

1460
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,691
it wouldn't surprise me         
if Sir Archie changed his mind. 

1461
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,127
Oh, no. There's no fear of that,
Peter.                          

1462
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,995
 He was enjoying the whole idea 
 of the thing.                  

1463
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,865
      And he's got no love      
      for your crowd.           

1464
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:07,901
             I see.             

1465
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,837
   This explains everything.    

1466
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:11,939
         - Does it?             
         - Conspiracy.          

1467
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,074
          Conspiracy?           

1468
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,710
    There's no word of truth    
    in any of it.               

1469
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,345
    It was merely the price     
    you had to pay              

1470
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,413
   for Sir Archie's goodwill.   

1471
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,083
  Do you really believe that?   

1472
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,653
  And you have the effrontery   
  to talk about corruption?     

1473
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,660
Your dismissal is final, Thomas.

1474
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:35,128
I have a weapon against you now.

1475
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,772
- Morning, Archie.              
- Got them on the run this time.

1476
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:47,675
   This solution of copper      
   carbonate is first-class.    

1477
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:50,077
      It kills the fungus.      

1478
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,612
     Thanks for the cigars.     

1479
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,781
    Not at all.                 
    You did me a good turn.     

1480
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:54,948
             Did I?             

1481
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,884
Oh, yourself really, I suppose. 

1482
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,252
 See, I went down and enquired  
 in the morning                 

1483
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:02,156
  and I discovered that shares  
  in the bottling plant         

1484
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:03,791
  were going for chickenfeed.   

1485
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:05,693
       So I bought them.        

1486
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,061
             What?              

1487
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:09,563
A controlling interest, really. 

1488
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,365
You see, I've been putting aside
a bit of money                  

1489
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:13,767
 for you and Katherine lately.  

1490
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,738
  You know, in the event of my  
  unhappy decease, and so on,   

1491
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,074
 and it struck me, why the hell 
 should you wait for it?        

1492
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,543
      So I bought you           
      the bottling plant.       

1493
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:25,646
You bought...the bottling plant?

1494
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,216
  I bought the bottling plant.  

1495
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:32,052
It's useless. It can't be used  
in this state. It's a dead loss.

1496
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:34,388
 Absolute nonsense. It's up to  
 you.                           

1497
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,089
     It's your money.           
     Yours and Katherine's.     

1498
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,326
    You mean you put all my     
    and Katherine's money       

1499
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,761
     into that useless load     
     of rubble?                 

1500
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:43,631
       - Yes.                   
       - You must be mad.       

1501
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,732
          Not at all.           

1502
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,533
I don't believe that story about
chrome sulphate                 

1503
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:48,235
    getting out of my pond.     

1504
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:51,238
  - But it's true.              
  - It's a matter of opinion.   

1505
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,508
 All you've got to do is to say 
 that you made a mistake.       

1506
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:59,312
 Nobody's gonna argue with you. 

1507
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:02,783
 By and by, the shares in       
 the bottling plant will go up  

1508
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,952
      and you'll have made      
      a small fortune.          

1509
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,920
    I cannae lie like that.     

1510
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:11,391
I think it's about time you came
to terms with the facts of life.

1511
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,660
You're not getting any younger, 
you know.                       

1512
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,262
     I wish to God I wasn't     
     so certain.                

1513
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,631
  I admit I've got a            
  responsibility to my family.  

1514
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,433
      Of course you have.       

1515
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,404
    Maybe I'll talk it over     
    with Katherine.             

1516
01:12:23,406 --> 01:12:25,706
   Good idea. Get a sensible    
   woman's advice.              

1517
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:28,141
 But look, don't wait too long, 

1518
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,043
  cos if you're not gonna use   
  those shares,                 

1519
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,579
  I've gotta do something with  
  them.                         

1520
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:33,881
  I don't know what. Give them  
  to a charity, I suppose.      

1521
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:35,282
   And what'll Katherine get?   

1522
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,353
       Katherine will get       
       sweet damn all.          

1523
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,467
 But why didn't you have a word 
 with us beforehand?            

1524
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,869
   Just a hint to Mr. Houston   
   or myself                    

1525
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,104
      would have made all       
      the difference.           

1526
01:12:59,374 --> 01:13:01,408
       A hint about what?       

1527
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,512
 About what was behind it all,  
 sir.                           

1528
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:07,047
 Behind all of what?            
 Say what you mean, Mr. Geikie. 

1529
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,516
          Ah, come on.          

1530
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,719
      No need to make such      
      a mystery of it.          

1531
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,486
We're all men of the world here.

1532
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:17,958
I mean, you're not gonna tell me
that your father-in-law         

1533
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,327
 hasn't bought up most of the   
 shares of the bottling plant.  

1534
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:25,165
No, no. I suppose he has. What's
all that got to do with it?     

1535
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,901
       Well, wouldn't it        
       have been better         

1536
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,336
   to have got somebody else    
   to do it?                    

1537
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:33,240
  Somebody who was maybe        
  not so near related to you?   

1538
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,943
   I myself think               
   it would have been better    

1539
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:38,445
     to have kept your name     
     out of it altogether.      

1540
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,480
   I mean, there was no need    
   for anybody                  

1541
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:44,752
 to know the attack on the spa  
 came from you.                 

1542
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,687
  Pity you didn't have a word   
  with us about it.             

1543
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:51,024
By the way, where's Carmichael? 

1544
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,493
         Ah, he's away.         

1545
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,729
      Maybe just as well.       

1546
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:59,133
 Didn't understand us           
 being a stranger, so to speak. 

1547
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:02,035
  On the contrary. I think he   
  understood you all too well.  

1548
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:06,306
       - And Mr. Houston?       
       - He's not well.         

1549
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:09,777
But as I was saying, you should 
have spread the responsibility. 

1550
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,379
      You kept it too much      
      to yourself.              

1551
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,414
           All right.           

1552
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:17,317
     Now what's your game?      

1553
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:20,020
 Well, the fact is, now we know 
 the way the wind blows,        

1554
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:23,356
we thought that we might be able
to put The Advertiser           

1555
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,126
  at your disposal after all.   

1556
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,862
    We? Who the hell are you    
    to speak for Houston?       

1557
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,732
         Oh, but I do.          

1558
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,434
             Good.              

1559
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:36,904
   What about public opinion?   
   Aren't you afraid of that?   

1560
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,307
        We'll change it.        

1561
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,910
 Your reason for wanting to get 
 hold of the bottling plant     

1562
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:45,078
  was in the public interest.   

1563
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,282
Oh, naturally. I mean, that's   
why Sir Archie came in with me. 

1564
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:52,953
 We'll tinker with the settling 
 pond, make it look all right.  

1565
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:56,323
   And it'll not cost a penny   
   of public money.             

1566
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,928
 That might work if you've got  
 The Advertiser behind you.     

1567
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,064
 The press is a power and free  
 country, sir.                  

1568
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:06,600
      And the rate-payers?      
      What about them?          

1569
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,236
    Oh, I think I can answer    
    for the rate-payers too.    

1570
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,476
And er... What exactly is in it 
for Houston?                    

1571
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:20,080
    Well, financial support     
    for The Advertiser          

1572
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,582
   would be very welcome.       
   It's a bit shaky just now.   

1573
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,919
  I would... Well, we would be  
  unwilling to suspend it       

1574
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,588
   while it still had so much   
   useful work to do.           

1575
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:35,628
And er...what if I was to refuse
to give you a single penny?     

1576
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:41,334
 I mean, we rich men don't like 
 parting with money.            

1577
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,370
      Well, I'd just have       
      to remind you             

1578
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:47,207
that this business of the shares
can be presented in two ways.   

1579
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,009
              Ah.               

1580
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,745
  And you're just the man to.   

1581
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,847
     Oh, well, Mr. Geikie.      

1582
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:58,185
   You can rest assured         
   I'll give careful thought    

1583
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,920
   to all that you have said.   

1584
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,923
      No hurry, sir.            
      Just take your time.      

1585
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,058
       Thank you, Geikie.       

1586
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:10,831
  You know, one of these days,  
  somebody is gonna spray you   

1587
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,900
      with a solution           
      of copper carbonate       

1588
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,468
      and it'll be a great      
      improvement.              

1589
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:29,950
(Tom) No, no, no, Archie. That  
is my answer and that is final. 

1590
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,451
        (Hangs up phone)        

1591
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,887
      Dad, are you serious      
      about Canada?             

1592
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:36,423
- Perfectly.                    
- Fantastic. When are we going? 

1593
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:38,926
              No.               

1594
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,094
 We are not going to run away.  

1595
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,964
   We're not going to Canada.   

1596
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,799
   But you're not going back    
   to that school.              

1597
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,467
  Well, what am I going to do?  

1598
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:50,237
  You're going to make a start  
  with those backward kids      

1599
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,571
      you're aye on about.      

1600
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:54,574
   We are going to teach them   
   that truth is truth.         

1601
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,044
   That was your grandfather    
   on the phone.                

1602
01:16:57,046 --> 01:17:00,280
   Even he...                   
   I gave him the answer no.    

1603
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:03,851
   That means your mother       
   has lost her expectations.   

1604
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,853
 You think that's gonna bother  
 her?                           

1605
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:08,555
     - Oh, I think it will.     
     - Rubbish.                 

1606
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,358
 Maybe she'll have to pinch and 
 scrape a wee bit on the house, 

1607
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,460
but she'll manage that. Come on.

1608
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:28,175
   - How are you doing, Kath?   
   - Not too bad, Donald.       

1609
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,977
     At least the cleansing     
     department                 

1610
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,713
 won't be able to report        
 us to the higher authorities.  

1611
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:34,447
       Don't be too sure.       

1612
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,717
   We don't have union cards    
   for this kind of work.       

1613
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,953
   - It's no joke, Donald.      
   - Believe me, I'm serious.   

1614
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:43,457
   I don't think Tom realizes   
   just what he's stirred up.   

1615
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:46,927
  I told Peggy to let him know  
  if things get really bad,     

1616
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:48,762
you can have rooms at the hotel.

1617
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:51,198
 You mean you think he's ruined 
 the tourist trade?             

1618
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,401
 - Maybe he's the making of it. 
 - With the spa closed?         

1619
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:57,204
     You can buy spa water      
     anywhere in the world.     

1620
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,906
 But there's very little truth  
 on offer today.                

1621
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:04,978
  Kate! Kate, my darling Kate!  
  We have it all sorted.        

1622
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,014
    Here is the battlefield.    

1623
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:10,217
Was, you mean, and it looked    
like it before we tidied it up. 

1624
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,819
    Is and always shall be.     

1625
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:13,253
  We're going to start our own  
  school.                       

1626
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,488
    This is my native place.    

1627
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,756
  Beginning with the backward   
  kids.                         

1628
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,257
      We shall teach them       
      nothing, Captain.         

1629
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,392
    No facts,                   
    no predetermined values.    

1630
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,262
  They shall grow up            
  as free and independent men.  

1631
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,965
  What do you think the school  
  board is going to say?        

1632
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:29,669
I shall preach in season and out
of season as it says somewhere. 

1633
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:34,141
 Surely you saw last night that 
 preaching does you no good.    

1634
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:35,442
 To hell with the school board. 

1635
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:38,678
    I just want to bang it      
    into every idiot's head     

1636
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,916
that democracy is the craftiest 
enemy of free men.              

1637
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,520
 Why, it can strangle any       
 promising young truth at birth 

1638
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:48,522
     even before it's born.     

1639
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:53,160
Majorities of fools can turn    
justice and morality upside down

1640
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,627
 till life isn't worth living.  

1641
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,397
I think I'll be able to explain 
that to quite a few folk.       

1642
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,266
   Probably, but I don't know   
   a lot about...               

1643
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,867
           Of course.           

1644
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,703
 My main trouble                
 is going to be finding someone 

1645
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,005
    with enough independence    
    and integrity               

1646
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:06,974
 to carry on my work after me.  

1647
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:11,979
 For goodness' sake. You've got 
 all the time you'll need, Dad. 

1648
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:15,848
    It's the leaders.           
    They must be wiped out.     

1649
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,717
 They are like ravening wolves. 

1650
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,586
 They have to feed on a certain 
 number of small creatures      

1651
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,588
  every year in order to keep   
  themselves going.             

1652
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,124
    I mean, look at Peter       
    and Houston and Geikie!     

1653
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,360
 See all the poor wee traitors  

1654
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:29,329
that they polish off year after 
year or else mangle and maim    

1655
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,864
 until they are fit for nothing 

1656
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:33,967
except to be members of         
the electorate and subscribers. 

1657
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,735
            My God.             

1658
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,538
     Subscribers to             
     The Baikie Advertiser.     

1659
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,508
 I have made a great discovery. 

1660
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,811
   Oh, no. Save us from that.   

1661
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:46,580
     I am the strongest man     
     in the world.              

1662
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:49,116
       - Oh, God help us.       
       - Right.                 

1663
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,818
   But say nothing. Not yet.    

1664
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:57,925
You see, the fact is, I am      
the strongest man in the world. 

1665
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:00,827
          (Peggy) Dad?          

1666
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:05,665
 The strongest man in the world 
 is the man who is most alone!

DIRECTED BY YASUZO MASUMURA

11
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:54,679
My name is Aki Shima.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,393
I was never very popular
as a fashion model.

13
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:08,401
But I was very moved by the artistic sense
of the photographer Mr. Yamana,

14
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:14,699
and I was quite willing to let him
take such pictures of me.

15
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,783
The exhibition created quite a sensation.

16
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,625
I went to the gallery one morning
for an early meeting

17
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,210
to discuss our next project.

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,009
At such an early hour,
there was only one visitor.

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:21,641
He didn't take any notice
of the photographs.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,772
He was crouched at the foot
of the featured statue.

21
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:35,112
It was a nude study of me,

22
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:38,366
sculpted by one of Mr. Yamana's friends.

23
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,287
This visitor's whole demeanor
was very strange.

24
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,503
What happened next was unexpected.

25
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:40,094
It felt as if the statue and my body
were somehow one.

26
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,514
I felt his hands
as he pawed at the statue,

27
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,728
as if he was running them
over my body.

28
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,984
It sent shivers down my back.

29
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,405
I ran out of the gallery.

30
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:34,148
Several days later,
I worked for Mr. Yamana again.

31
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:40,070
I woke up at four in the morning
and drove down to the studio.

32
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:47,077
Mr. Yamana was very demanding.
Working for him was hard.

33
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,998
I was exhausted,

34
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:56,921
but still had to drive back
to my apartment in Tokyo.

35
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:08,974
Once home, I called a local masseur
to relieve my fatigue.

36
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,982
It's open. Come in.

37
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,077
I'm from Sakura Massage.

38
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:35,251
They've never sent you before.

39
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:39,129
Yes... that's correct.

40
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,551
Your usual masseur
Is otherwise occupied.

41
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,845
They sent me instead.

42
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,348
- Do you mind?
- I guess not.

43
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:53,727
I only moved here three days ago.
I beg your favor.

44
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,106
Hurry up and start.

45
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,820
With your permission...

46
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,997
Put some effort into it. I like it hard.

47
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,458
If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't satisfy me.

48
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,253
Like this?

49
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,505
No! Harder than that!

50
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,846
Your body is quite stiff.

51
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,725
Massage is good
for younger women, too.

52
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,687
It stimulates the circulation
so your skin looks more beautiful.

53
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,774
More so for someone
in your line of work.

54
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,236
How do you know what I do?

55
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,198
You're Aki Shima.
Famous for those sensational photos.

56
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,202
And very famous among we masseurs.

57
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,625
Sometimes I really appreciate my work.

58
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,170
I get to talk to famous people like you.

59
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,548
And besides, I get to touch you.

60
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,217
I'm not famous.

61
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,762
You're very beautiful.

62
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,015
Don't flatter me. My looks are average.

63
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,019
Not at all.
To the blind, faces don't really matter.

64
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:21,231
It's your body and the silkiness
of your skin that are important.

65
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,986
You really are quite exceptional.

66
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,783
Stop that! What the hell?

67
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,369
I'm terribly sorry.

68
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,333
The blind have eyes in our fingertips.

69
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:44,254
I know your body better
than someone who can see.

70
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,507
From top to bottom.

71
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:53,430
The feel of the blind man's fingers
on my body

72
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,934
was exactly like the man
stroking the statue.

73
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:03,399
Could it be him?
Maybe cold clay wasn't enough.

74
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,736
The thought of that made me angry.

75
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,491
I said no! Don't you understand?

76
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,162
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,290
That's enough. You can leave.

78
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,459
But I've just started.

79
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:27,297
Forget it. I'm very tired,
I need to get some rest.

80
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:31,969
I'll pay you anyway.
700 yen, isn't it?

81
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,226
What are you doing?

82
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,281
It is you! I knew it!

83
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,196
- Well done.
- My coat.

84
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,666
Finally, you're awake!

85
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,256
It's you, isn't it?

86
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,968
Where are you?

87
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,762
Where?

88
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,555
<i>I'm here!</i>

89
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:40,425
What is this place? Where am I?

90
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,887
This is my studio.

91
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,266
Your studio?

92
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,810
It looks just like a warehouse
from outside.

93
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,773
What are you?

94
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,194
I'm an amateur sculptor.

95
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,405
A sculptor?

96
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,700
I'm blind.

97
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,370
I was born with damaged optic nerves.

98
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,206
I'm totally blind.

99
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,502
Being blind is miserable.

100
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:19,298
From listening to people
and Braille books,

101
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:23,844
I can picture much of the world's beauty.

102
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,056
The sunlight,

103
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,017
the color of clouds,

104
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,852
splendid scenery,

105
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:36,857
and the beauty of works of art,
plays, movies, even TV.

106
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,527
But I cannot see a thing.

107
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,157
I hate my parents for this.

108
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,203
However... that doesn't achieve
a single thing.

109
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:29,493
All that is left for the blind

110
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:34,539
is sound, smell, taste
and our sense of touch.

111
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,002
Sounds are like the wind,
no satisfaction.

112
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,297
Smells are also useless.

113
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,636
Human noses aren't sensitive
like dogs' noses.

114
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,056
Food merely serves to fill our bellies.

115
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:58,688
But what I have discovered is that
touch is the only way to amuse us.

116
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,566
Our one tactile satisfaction.

117
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:33,932
Touch is the only sense
worth anything to me.

118
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,310
I've touched everything I can.

119
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,608
I liked the feeling
of touching animals best.

120
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:48,488
They're so warm and soft.

121
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:54,744
I've had dogs and cats to stroke.

122
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,832
I've been to a farm
to play with sheep and horses.

123
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:05,213
However, no animal can compare
with human flesh.

124
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:09,718
Especially the feel of women's bodies.

125
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,874
After finishing school,
I took a course in massage.

126
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:46,755
Every night, I went to inns,
hotels and apartments to work.

127
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,090
But not for the money.

128
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,344
I wanted to feel the women's skin.

129
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:56,848
Like faces,
every woman's skin is different,

130
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:00,185
each with its own shape and feel.

131
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,815
So many women,
I became totally fixated.

132
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:28,880
Around then, I sold some land
that I'd inherited from my father.

133
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:31,383
I made a fortune out of it.

134
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,013
But a blind man like me
could find no use for money.

135
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:43,520
So I bought this warehouse
and took up sculpture.

136
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,653
Recalling all of those women,
I reproduced their body parts from memory.

137
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,907
Now I can caress them at any time.

138
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,689
It took six years to build the studio.

139
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,734
I spent most of my inheritance.

140
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,322
When it was finally completed,
I was so happy.

141
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,741
And now,
I spend most of my time here.

142
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,828
Days and nights here in the darkness.

143
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:46,791
I amuse myself by caressing
their bodies at will.

144
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,913
Be careful.

145
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,416
I'll put the lights on.

146
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,150
This is my studio.

147
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:38,194
What do you think?

148
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,238
You're insane!

149
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,825
But I've got bored with the studio.

150
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,453
Real bodies are nothing like this.

151
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:52,834
Not like the soft bodies
of beautiful women with luscious skin.

152
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,506
When I finally realized
that's what I needed,

153
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,468
I heard schoolboys on the train
talking about you.

154
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,679
What did they say?

155
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:11,269
They were discussing
your photos and statue.

156
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,192
I went to the exhibition space
and ran my hands over the sculpture.

157
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,656
I registered at your massage agency
and finally got to touch you.

158
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,327
Those boys were right.

159
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,206
Your body is the finest I've ever known.

160
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:37,462
Your shape, your skin texture
are exactly what I want.

161
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:44,052
- Get away from me!
- Please don't worry, I'd never hurt you.

162
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,095
What do you plan to do with me?

163
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,934
I want you to stay a while
and be a model for my sculpture.

164
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:56,856
- That's why you kidnapped me?
- You would never have agreed.

165
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:58,817
I had no choice.

166
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:04,155
- Will you be my model?
- No way! I refuse!

167
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:07,408
I'll pay you very generously.

168
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,620
I don't want money.

169
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:14,499
With you as my model,
I'll create a wonderful work of art.

170
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,214
There are many kinds of art
in our world.

171
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,885
Art for amusing the eye,
the ear and the mind.

172
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,598
- Why can't touching be an art form?
- That's not my problem!

173
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:32,892
Every day we use touch.

174
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:36,688
We touch bowls, vases,
desks and chairs.

175
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,357
Clothes and furs, too.

176
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:44,279
Art is more than color and shape,
what about touch?

177
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,783
- What about it?
- I want to pioneer the art of touching.

178
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,453
An art only the blind can appreciate.

179
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,665
A new art form, by and for the blind.

180
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,085
That is my life's mission.

181
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,714
I beg you, please be my model!

182
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,843
No way!

183
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,305
Go on, you can beat me, kick me.

184
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,475
I'll be your slave.
You can do anything to me.

185
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,228
Just let me touch your body.

186
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:22,233
Help me create a totally new genre of art.

187
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,738
No! You're wasting your time!

188
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,324
Why?

189
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:34,203
You stripped naked
for that photographer Yamana!

190
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,456
So why not for me?

191
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:42,921
That's obvious.
Mr. Yamana is a great artist.

192
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:48,593
He depicted me as
The New Woman Of Our Age.

193
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,970
That's why I posed for him!

194
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,265
But I also create art!

195
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,352
What? That's crap and you're crazy.

196
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,146
You just want to feel me up.

197
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:02,857
- Why do you say that?
- Just stop!

198
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:06,861
In that case...

199
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:11,866
But I won't give up.

200
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,369
I'll wait,
no matter how long it takes.

201
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,748
I won't let you go until you agree.

202
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,628
You intend to lock me up in here?

203
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:28,049
Fine! The police will come
and find me all the sooner.

204
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:31,177
No, the police won't come.

205
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,720
Why not?

206
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:39,018
I used a false identity
when I registered as a masseur.

207
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,022
Nobody saw us bringing you here.

208
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:47,110
Besides, we changed taxis many times.

209
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:50,321
And we walked the last few blocks.

210
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:55,493
Even a massive search
wouldn't find you.

211
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,580
You're insane!

212
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,847
You can't open it. It's locked.

213
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,641
Help!

214
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,685
Somebody help me!

215
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:25,982
There's no use screaming.
They're double doors of sheet iron.

216
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:43,499
It's futile to try and escape.

217
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,423
I can follow your scent,
and the sound of your breath.

218
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,967
I can soon find you.

219
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:59,474
If you keep this up,
you'll collapse from exhaustion.

220
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,466
Looks like I've got you.

221
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,638
Stop it right now, or you'll regret it!

222
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:32,191
You've got goose bumps.
Why are you so scared?

223
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,363
Let go of me!

224
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,535
You give me no choice

225
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,414
I'll have to use this again.

226
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:10,665
- How was your breakfast?
- She hasn't touched a thing.

227
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,708
If you don't eat, you'll get sick.

228
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,505
I want to talk. Come here.

229
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,216
Talk about what?

230
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:30,434
I sat up all night
thinking about my position.

231
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:34,855
If you continue to lock me up here,

232
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:38,818
I won't be able to eat or sleep.

233
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,153
I'll go insane and I'll die.

234
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:43,447
So?

235
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,703
I'll do as you say...
I'll be your model.

236
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,164
Really?

237
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,379
But once the sculpture's finished,
you'll let me go, right?

238
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:00,006
Naturally.

239
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:04,802
After thinking about it,

240
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:11,726
I realized that the art of touching
is really quite an interesting concept.

241
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,645
A bold experiment.

242
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,524
It didn't take long to change your mind,
just one night.

243
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,820
I was so scared, I could hardly think.

244
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:27,408
In these circumstances,
I think anybody would be the same.

245
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,538
But once I calmed down,

246
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,584
I realized you're not insane at all.

247
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,379
You're a pioneer artist
in a brand-new genre.

248
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:44,175
Do you really think so?

249
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,971
The energy and passion that
you've shown in creating this studio

250
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:51,599
proves you're truly unique.

251
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:57,980
I want to work with you
to pioneer the art of touching.

252
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,277
I'm so pleased that
you finally understand.

253
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:05,905
Thank you.

254
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,701
Let's start right away.
I want your best work.

255
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:12,244
Indeed!

256
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:03,712
You're one in a million.

257
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:08,092
I searched long and hard for a body
such as yours. I love this body.

258
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,221
Is it okay if I take a break?

259
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,557
But we've barely started.

260
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,977
- I don't feel well.
- What's wrong?

261
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,149
My stomach really hurts.

262
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,776
Where? Where does it hurt?

263
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,238
You won't call a doctor, will you?

264
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:31,282
No, of course not.

265
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:35,286
I've caught a chill,
but I'll just have to bear it.

266
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:39,373
Shall I turn up the heating for you?

267
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:45,421
Do you have any painkillers?

268
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,340
Normal aspirin will do.

269
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,301
I'll go and have a look.

270
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,138
If not, can you buy me some?

271
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,267
I want to get well
and get back to modelling.

272
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,810
I understand.

273
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,347
Where are you going?

274
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,808
<i>Let go! Let go of me!</i>

275
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:36,365
Michio, she's trying to escape!
Come quickly!

276
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,538
Was she really trying to escape,
Mother?

277
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:46,917
If I'd been any later, she'd be long gone.

278
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,461
Is that right?

279
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:59,471
So you lied to me
with your fancy stories.

280
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,683
Let me go! Please! Let me go!

281
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:06,687
You can't leave
until Michio finishes his work.

282
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:09,773
No! I'll go crazy!

283
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:12,526
Let me out! Let me go!

284
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,778
Quieten down.

285
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,159
I'll keep watch over her.

286
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:25,623
You concentrate on your art,
it's your only pleasure in life.

287
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,625
Thank you.

288
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,502
I couldn't do anything without you,
Mother.

289
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:35,758
Don't be silly.
You know I'd do anything for you.

290
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,968
Any mother would.

291
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,471
Now get back to your work.

292
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,014
Hey!

293
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:27,810
How long will it take you to finish it?

294
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:33,691
This will be the pinnacle of my art,
so I can't really say.

295
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,275
Really?

296
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,949
If that's the case,
maybe we should try to be friends.

297
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:47,996
If not, this oppressive atmosphere
will drive me crazy.

298
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,083
It's your fault, you tried to trick me.

299
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:56,839
I'm very hungry.

300
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,425
Mother will bring lunch soon.

301
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:05,472
Will you eat here together with me?

302
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,225
Together?

303
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,854
I don't have much appetite
eating on my own.

304
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,065
I'll lose weight and my skin will suffer.

305
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:19,737
- I won't be much of a model.
- That simply won't do.

306
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:25,117
That's why I want us to dine together.
What do you think?

307
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,621
Or would you prefer to eat
with your mommy?

308
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,416
What mischief are you planning now?

309
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:38,422
Do you love your mother?

310
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:41,508
Of course I do.

311
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,346
She raised a blind boy all by herself.

312
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:53,228
She taught me to read and write,
to live as a human.

313
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:57,566
I couldn't do without her in my life.

314
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:01,361
Was it always just the two of you?
Where's your father?

315
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,823
He died of an illness
soon after I was born.

316
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:07,117
Any friends, any lovers?

317
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,744
Not one.

318
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,999
So you've never had a woman?
You poor thing.

319
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,961
That's why you built this studio.

320
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:22,257
You prefer cold clay
to a living, breathing woman.

321
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:25,594
Mother is the only woman I know.

322
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,016
Now I know why you make
such gigantic figures.

323
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,021
They're from a baby's perspective.

324
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:40,359
You love to nestle in their arms
like a baby.

325
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,946
I wonder...

326
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,367
But a real woman is totally different.

327
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,996
If you had a lover, you'd know.
It's so much more fun.

328
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,207
Is that right?

329
00:38:56,166 --> 00:39:02,297
Well? What will you do,
eat with me or with Mommy?

330
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,804
I'll eat with you.

331
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,223
I'm thrilled!

332
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:14,393
- I'd like a drink, too.
- Alcohol?

333
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:19,231
You like a drink, don't you?
It gives you an appetite.

334
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:22,442
No. I've never tried alcohol.

335
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:27,531
Eh? You've never tasted alcohol?
You poor thing.

336
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,616
It's sublimely delicious!

337
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,201
Really?

338
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,662
I love wine. Go buy some.

339
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,790
Is this another trick?

340
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,168
You get me drunk and then run away?

341
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,589
You're so suspicious.

342
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:50,387
Your mother wouldn't let me past.
I've given up trying to escape.

343
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,142
Is that true?

344
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,896
Will your mother get angry
if you dine with me?

345
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:01,899
Not at all.

346
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,027
She'll do anything I ask her to.

347
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,653
I wonder

348
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,949
I'll bring you some dinner and a drink.

349
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:29,134
That was an excellent meal.
I've eaten every scrap.

350
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,512
Alcohol tastes wonderful, doesn't it?

351
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:36,016
Is my face flushed?

352
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,811
It has a lovely glow!

353
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:48,612
Other than my mother,
you're the first person I've dined with.

354
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,074
Was it fun?
Shall we continue doing it?

355
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,533
Yes.

356
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,745
- Are you still angry?
- No.

357
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:02,042
So, shall we get back to work?

358
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:05,295
Well, I'll put these away first.

359
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,130
Just leave them.

360
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,800
Your mother will do it anyway.

361
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,678
Carry me up there.

362
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:28,360
You've finished the arms and legs.
What's bit's next?

363
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:31,613
- I want to do your breasts.
- Right...

364
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,871
Go on, touch them.

365
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:48,505
Your fingers are very delicate,
but ever so masculine.

366
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:53,427
- It feels wonderful.
- So why did you object to being my model?

367
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,556
At first, I didn't like the idea.

368
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,892
But I've gradually grown to like you.

369
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,229
I didn't realize just how gentle you are.

370
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:06,106
I can hardly believe it.

371
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:11,570
There's not another man
who worships my body like you.

372
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,406
What about that photographer Yamana?

373
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:20,954
No, it's different with him.
I'm just another model to him.

374
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,916
But I'm your one and only.

375
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:31,965
We women are conceited, we need
to dominate. I'm very, very lucky.

376
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,011
I really love you.

377
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,473
It's another trick! You're lying!

378
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,604
Don't you believe me?

379
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,607
I'll show you proof.

380
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:12,005
Do you still doubt me?

381
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,634
I'll keep going
until you change your mind.

382
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:18,303
No, I believe you.

383
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,139
I really do.

384
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:26,144
I always thought being blind
would repel most women.

385
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:31,066
Do you love me?

386
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,609
Of course I do.

387
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:36,488
- Was that your first ever kiss?
- Yes.

388
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,449
Did you enjoy it?

389
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:42,077
Tongues are far more sensitive
than fingers.

390
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:46,540
So warm, soft and sweet.

391
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:52,754
Right, you try it this time.

392
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,733
Michio!

393
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,405
What is it, Mother?

394
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,159
Stop playing around
and get back to your work!

395
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:37,215
Your mother seems angry.
I wonder why.

396
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,050
She's shocked.

397
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,846
It's the first time she's seen me
in a woman's arms.

398
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,349
There's so much I can teach you.

399
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:50,812
Things only a lover knows
and a mother cannot do.

400
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,401
Michio! It's almost dawn.
You need your sleep.

401
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,903
Don't overtax yourself.

402
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:23,822
I want to keep going.

403
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:29,536
Be happy for me, she's helping me
make a unique work of art.

404
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,163
Really? That's wonderful.

405
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,582
And she loves me.

406
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,460
<i>- She actually loves me.
- Nonsense!</i>

407
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:41,589
It sounds unlikely,
but it's the honest truth.

408
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:46,511
You idiot!
Can't you see she's fooling you?

409
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:50,765
When you let your guard down,
she'll escape.

410
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,394
I really have fallen in love with him.

411
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,272
I could stay here forever.

412
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,399
Don't be ridiculous!

413
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:05,113
No flighty young thing like you
would ever fall for a man like Michio!

414
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:10,618
What's that supposed to mean?
Am I so repellent?

415
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,455
I know very well what she's up to.

416
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,001
She's making a fool
of a blind country bumpkin!

417
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,630
- Is that right?
- Oh, I get it now.

418
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,425
Your mother's jealous.

419
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,387
She's bad-mouthing me
for stealing her precious son.

420
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:32,015
Jealous? Mother's jealous?

421
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,975
Yes!

422
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,644
You're more than a son to her,
you know.

423
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:42,359
She's substituted you
for her husband or a lover.

424
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,612
So she sees me as her rival.

425
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,155
Shut up!

426
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:53,995
I can understand it, but it disgusts me.
Especially at her age.

427
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,706
Is she right, Mother?

428
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:02,337
I won't stand by and watch her
make a total fool out of you!

429
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:08,885
Mother, I'm an adult.
I want you to stop being jealous.

430
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,180
I'm free to fall in love, aren't I?

431
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:15,642
<i>Oh, really?
Then do as you please!</i>

432
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,961
You're free to go.

433
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,842
- What did you say?
- Get dressed and get out of here.

434
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:34,220
- I can leave?
- Yes!

435
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:40,894
If you go to the police, I'll get you back.

436
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,063
If it takes my whole life, I swear.

437
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,440
I understand.

438
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:51,988
There's money in your bag.
Go and hail a taxi.

439
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:54,574
Hurry up.

440
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:24,145
Mother?

441
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:28,066
Where are you going?

442
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:33,738
It's snowing, and we're freezing,
so I'm just going to get some coal.

443
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:35,281
Out of my way.

444
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,287
Why aren't you going alone?

445
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,333
Why do you have to take her with you?

446
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:46,876
Mother?

447
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,800
Alright, I'll tell you straight.

448
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,512
- I'm getting rid of her.
- But why?

449
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,806
The sculpture isn't finished yet.

450
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,308
You can find another girl.

451
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:04,435
I'll help you find one.

452
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,396
Don't you understand?

453
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,691
It has to be her.

454
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,902
Her type are a dime a dozen!

455
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:16,197
She's unique.
I'll never find another like her.

456
00:51:16,322 --> 00:51:19,826
<i>Michio, please!
Forget all about her!</i>

457
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,786
No!

458
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:33,715
What are you doing, Mother?

459
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,551
Michio, listen to me.

460
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,679
I've done everything
you've ever asked for.

461
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:43,725
I helped you buy
and then build the studio.

462
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,353
Just once, do this one thing for me!

463
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,608
Please, get rid of her!

464
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:55,486
No, never!

465
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:06,664
- Mother...
- How dare you do this to me?

466
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:13,463
Have you forgotten how I sacrificed
everything to raise you?

467
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,967
It wasn't easy to raise a blind child!

468
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,305
And who was it who gave birth
to a blind child?

469
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,848
It was you!

470
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,853
Don't you ever forget, Michio,

471
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:32,732
that I did my utmost
to raise you properly.

472
00:52:32,857 --> 00:52:35,234
This girl's the exact opposite!

473
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:40,031
She loves only herself,
she has no feelings for you.

474
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:44,285
If you don't get rid of her now,
you'll suffer for it.

475
00:52:45,244 --> 00:52:47,246
She's not like that.

476
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,667
She's sweet and kind.

477
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:54,170
You have no idea
about the outside world.

478
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:57,882
And you know absolutely nothing
about women!

479
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:01,052
A slut like her is nothing but trouble!

480
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:06,474
- A slut, am I?
- Of course!

481
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,144
That's what we call women
who bare their bodies for money.

482
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:14,232
You call it "art", but it's just greed
and grasping for fame.

483
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,235
I'm not like that.

484
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:21,489
I'm a virgin,
I've lead a good, honest life.

485
00:53:21,614 --> 00:53:23,199
Don't make me laugh!

486
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:27,870
How did you fool Michio?
Go on, tell me!

487
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:37,130
What kind of mother
humiliates her son's lover?

488
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,007
I know what you're trying to do.

489
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:47,181
You want your little boy to stay forever.
You want to sleep with him.

490
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:48,933
What did you say?

491
00:53:50,184 --> 00:53:52,019
I feel sorry for Michio.

492
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:56,149
With a mother like you,
he can never find love.

493
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,318
Always alone, Mommy's little plaything.

494
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,112
Shut your mouth!

495
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,991
Is that what you want?

496
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:12,915
To never experience physical love?
Always a boy, never a real man?

497
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,709
I love you!

498
00:54:15,793 --> 00:54:17,545
I want to be with you.

499
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,758
Is she more important to you
than me?

500
00:54:24,218 --> 00:54:25,803
How could you?

501
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,684
I want to save you from her.

502
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:33,853
I'll even marry you.

503
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:38,775
On the one condition
that you cut all ties to her.

504
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:46,073
Any real mother would be pleased
to raise a son and send him into the world.

505
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,409
Don't you agree?

506
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:50,036
You bitch!

507
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,248
Mother!

508
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:58,878
What are you doing?

509
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,174
Please stop it!

510
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,720
Mother!

511
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,682
Please, Mother!

512
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,185
Stop it!

513
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:16,521
<i>Help me!</i>

514
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,859
I'll kill you! Die, you bitch!

515
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:24,654
I can't breathe!

516
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,239
<i>Help me!</i>

517
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,573
<i>Help me!</i>

518
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,409
<i>Help me!</i>

519
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,579
Mother, stop it!

520
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,958
I can't breathe!

521
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:39,710
Let her go!

522
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:44,006
She's killing me!

523
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,218
Mother, will you stop it?

524
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,193
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

525
00:56:06,904 --> 00:56:08,322
I'm fine.

526
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,373
Something's wrong with your mother.

527
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:20,042
What's that?

528
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:48,070
She's dead.

529
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:50,031
Dead?

530
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,953
Mother! What's happened?

531
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:57,830
Mother!

532
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:04,837
She fell against the pillar.
She must've hit her head.

533
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,467
Mother...

534
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,639
What have I done to you?

535
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,184
You loved me so much.

536
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,812
<i>You took such care of me!</i>

537
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:25,566
How could I go and kill you?

538
00:57:27,568 --> 00:57:30,321
Mother, please forgive me!

539
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,661
It was my fault!

540
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:40,581
I was so stupid.

541
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:45,544
Please forgive me!

542
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:45,771
You will stay, won't you?

543
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:54,280
You're running away?

544
00:59:13,507 --> 00:59:15,468
Let me go, please!

545
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:21,640
She was right.
You lied about loving me.

546
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,810
Let me go! I'm sick of this!

547
00:59:25,936 --> 00:59:28,272
You deliberately provoked my mother.

548
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:33,069
Didn't you?
All you want is to escape.

549
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,906
Of course!
How can I possibly stay here?

550
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,449
Let me go!

551
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,457
You despicable woman,
deceiving a blind man.

552
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:51,253
It was you who killed my mother!

553
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:19,573
It's no use fighting back.

554
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,868
You're coming with me!

555
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,926
Kill me! Just kill me!

556
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:44,098
I'd rather be dead than suffer this!

557
01:01:20,384 --> 01:01:24,471
You won't get away now.
I won't let you go.

558
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,351
In place of Mother,
you'll be here till you die! I.

559
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:45,659
You said I was a mama's boy,
not a man, didn't you?

560
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:52,583
You laughed and said my work
is a poor substitute for a real woman.

561
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:57,004
Right... I'll prove to you I'm a man.

562
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,382
I'll take your virginity!

563
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:12,102
You animal!

564
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,271
You animal!

565
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:21,487
Yes, the beast who killed his mother.

566
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:23,948
I can do anything now!

567
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:32,122
You're all mine, and I'll have you.

568
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,875
You'll be my woman.

569
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:41,840
I'd rather die!

570
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,764
No, you don't.
You'll make a man of me.

571
01:02:50,015 --> 01:02:53,852
I'll show you love.
Then you'll know.

572
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,592
Several days passed.

573
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:33,976
We buried his mother
under the dirt floor of the old warehouse.

574
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:48,574
In the studio, with total disregard
for day or night,

575
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,785
he made love to me repeatedly.

576
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,834
By the time he had finished
the sculpture,

577
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:05,799
I'd started to develop
a slight affection for him.

578
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:15,392
Do you still want to leave here?

579
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,146
To leave me and go back
to the outside world?

580
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,858
Not now.

581
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:27,988
It's strange, but I seem
to have forgotten that world.

582
01:04:28,113 --> 01:04:32,326
Have you given up
because you can't escape?

583
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:38,582
That's not it.

584
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:40,876
I don't hate you anymore.

585
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,419
Why is that?

586
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:48,926
Making love with you has been wonderful.

587
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:55,641
You're so strong, yet so gentle.

588
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:01,438
You've shown me
the true beauty of a woman.

589
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:05,776
Sculptures are inanimate.

590
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:11,031
They can never match the feel
of a real woman.

591
01:05:13,283 --> 01:05:15,494
You are far superior.

592
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:21,458
At the same time
as I was falling in love with him,

593
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,211
I, too, began to go blind.

594
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,554
Darling.

595
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:38,684
I'm going blind.

596
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:46,608
Here, in constant darkness,
only feeling and caressing your body,

597
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:51,488
my eyes have atrophied,
and I've started to go blind.

598
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,201
So, you're like me now.

599
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:59,830
Is it a disability? Are you sad?

600
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:01,999
Quite the opposite.

601
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:06,170
People pity the blind.
What a big mistake.

602
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,756
I pity those who have sight.

603
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:15,345
They can never know
the tactile ecstasy of our caresses.

604
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,849
You finally understand.

605
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:21,810
I do.

606
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,813
My sense of touch is so acute.

607
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:30,986
So sweet, so deep, yet so certain.

608
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:38,994
Shape, form and color can't even approach
our tactile level of artistic expression.

609
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,413
So I'm not crazy, am I?

610
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:45,542
You're not insane, you're amazing.

611
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,422
Your sense of touch
is almost not human.

612
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,133
I envy you.

613
01:06:53,258 --> 01:06:58,430
Someday, you shall reach
the same level as me.

614
01:07:01,975 --> 01:07:04,603
How I wish that day would come.

615
01:07:08,106 --> 01:07:11,818
The sensation at the tip of my fingers

616
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:15,906
has become so acute
I can almost "taste".

617
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:23,413
As sensitive as insect feelers
and animal whiskers.

618
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:30,879
Like the lower orders of life,
without eyes, only able to feel.

619
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:37,135
Like an amoeba, or a jellyfish,
at the dawn of life.

620
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:42,933
The same sensations
as the most primeval creature.

621
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:48,230
As if going back to the womb
of human creation,

622
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,943
so dark, so sweet
and so pervadingly familiar.

623
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:59,241
When I look with my eyes,

624
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:03,745
you're a different man
from the one I feel.

625
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,831
How different?

626
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,626
You look normal,

627
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,922
but to the touch, you're divine.

628
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:22,347
These small depressions,
the large curves and projections.

629
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:28,395
As I caress your body,
I perceive constant variations.

630
01:08:29,771 --> 01:08:32,399
Like the flow of a musical masterpiece.

631
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,528
- Delicious fun!
- Is that right?

632
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,077
Again, days flew by.

633
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:50,584
We both explored
the innermost secrets of our bodies.

634
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:56,131
The most subtle and shaded nuance
of each other's flesh.

635
01:08:56,256 --> 01:09:00,260
But in our tactile world
of touch and feeling,

636
01:09:00,385 --> 01:09:03,889
we discovered unwritten,
unrelenting, natural laws.

637
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:11,480
So much pleasure only spurred an
ever-increasing demand for more sensation,

638
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,858
seeking greater satisfaction,

639
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:18,987
an unquenchable desire
for ever more pleasure.

640
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,077
More!

641
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,204
Harder!

642
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:30,874
Like this?

643
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,837
Not enough.

644
01:09:35,962 --> 01:09:38,965
Bite me, bite me hard!

645
01:09:40,133 --> 01:09:41,468
Like this?

646
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:48,183
Even harder.

647
01:09:48,308 --> 01:09:50,102
Make me bleed.

648
01:09:55,857 --> 01:09:57,192
More?

649
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,362
Harder!

650
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,159
That feels so good!

651
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:14,209
Now it's my turn. You bite me.

652
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:35,814
That was the beginning.

653
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:42,028
We began to take our pleasure
through biting, clawing,

654
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:46,032
and beating our bodies
in a rage of sensation.

655
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:55,500
The pain-pleasure from nails, teeth
and fists gradually declined in intensity.

656
01:10:56,626 --> 01:11:01,089
We began using various devices
to stimulate each other.

657
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:04,342
<i>Whip me!</i>

658
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:37,542
The more I suffered,
the more I craved.

659
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:41,880
What is it within
that brings forth such ecstasy?

660
01:11:43,715 --> 01:11:49,429
Does it mean that I was born
with masochistic tendencies?

661
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,517
Had I arrived at the point

662
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,395
where natural law
and the sensations of pleasure collide?

663
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:03,401
We couldn't stop ourselves.

664
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,657
We escalated
from innocuous devices of pleasure

665
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:13,703
until we turned to knives
to extract our ecstasy.

666
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:48,238
You really want me to cut you?

667
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:49,781
Go ahead.

668
01:12:52,492 --> 01:12:54,119
Where?

669
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,790
Anywhere.

670
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,459
Wherever you want.

671
01:13:02,794 --> 01:13:04,129
Here?

672
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:09,509
Cut me. Cut me. Hurry.

673
01:13:26,192 --> 01:13:28,111
Does it hurt?

674
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:29,654
It's agony,

675
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,241
but exquisite!

676
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,328
Hurt me more!

677
01:13:37,078 --> 01:13:39,372
Cover me with scars!

678
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,000
How's that?

679
01:13:46,504 --> 01:13:49,883
More. I don't care if I die.

680
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,053
Give it everything.

681
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,097
You want me to cut you up?

682
01:13:56,222 --> 01:13:58,600
You like that pain?

683
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:02,270
Cut me deeper.

684
01:14:03,146 --> 01:14:07,275
Cut deep into me and twist the knife.

685
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:22,832
Are you alright?

686
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,721
It's so good!

687
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:43,687
Drink more of my blood!

688
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,932
Now... it's your turn.

689
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:04,267
That's when we began the inhuman rite
of drinking each other's blood.

690
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:10,065
The ecstasy of it marked our descent
into a nonhuman abyss.

691
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:20,658
But constant bliss, such as we felt,
was never destined to last for long.

692
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:30,376
The stench of his mother's corpse
began to fill the studio.

693
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:42,347
Our bodies cut and scarred
as if from battle,

694
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:47,560
the loss of blood and constant pain
began to sap our vitality.

695
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:02,408
We won't last much longer, will we?

696
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,331
I can barely muster the strength to stand.

697
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:13,128
All we have left is
to wait for death to claim us.

698
01:17:15,338 --> 01:17:18,883
Do you regret it now?

699
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:22,804
Why should I?

700
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:25,098
I've feasted on a bliss

701
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:31,229
that most people
never even know exists.

702
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:37,360
- I'm ready to die any time.
- Are you?

703
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:45,535
Listen... I've got a good idea.

704
01:17:46,744 --> 01:17:48,163
What is it?

705
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,250
If we're to die anyway

706
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:58,381
make it an ecstatic death for me.

707
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:02,218
Bring me to tears of joy!

708
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:04,304
But how?

709
01:18:07,932 --> 01:18:10,476
Cut my arms off.

710
01:18:11,644 --> 01:18:13,521
And my legs as well.

711
01:18:16,107 --> 01:18:20,278
Cut this body of mine into pieces.

712
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:21,738
Why?

713
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:28,411
I'm sure it will be agony,

714
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:33,208
but also the ultimate ecstasy.

715
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:36,669
As I reach that climax,

716
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,673
make it my moment of death.

717
01:18:41,507 --> 01:18:46,721
You prefer that
to a slow, lingering death?

718
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:49,432
Of course.

719
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,560
I beg you!

720
01:18:55,146 --> 01:18:56,564
I understand.

721
01:19:01,444 --> 01:19:03,613
I'll die with you.

722
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:28,304
To have my arms and legs
cut from my body.

723
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:36,354
What a fitting punishment
for our sybaritic descent

724
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:39,941
into a world where touch was bliss.

725
01:19:41,442 --> 01:19:45,780
I gave myself a death sentence.

726
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,990
I'll start to cut.

727
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:13,659
Good.

728
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:00,248
Are you happy?

729
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,419
Now the other arm.

730
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,236
Don't stop now. My legs.

731
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:31,779
Quickly.

732
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,876
The world of touch...

733
01:23:27,543 --> 01:23:29,754
The world of insects...

734
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:35,551
The lower orders
such as the jellyfish...

735
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:40,181
Those who venture
to the edge of such worlds

736
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:46,187
can expect only a dark, dank death
to envelope them.

737
01:23:56,197 --> 01:24:04,197
THE END

Day 34

3
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,780
From monitoring Onsu through the smart home system

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,930
and psychological behavioral surveillance cameras.

5
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,020
The cause of Onsu's symptoms dates back
five years ago, after the death of her only mother

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,280
After a long battle with cancer.

7
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,930
where she exhibited symptoms of panic disorder.

8
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,230
She later moved
to an isolated country house with a strange environment.

9
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,250
and the stress of preparing for exams
All day alone at home

10
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,770
It seems to have caused a cumulative
that led to her condition.

11
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,130
Holy Night: Demon Hunters

12
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay, I'm done.

13
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,770
(Kim) Manager.

14
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,320
- (Choi) Captain, is he here?
- (Sharon).

15
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,860
(Paw) here, right?

16
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,400
Yes, it exists.

17
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,950
You have a visitor.

18
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
Hello.

19
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,780
Yes.

20
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,490
Yes, you can enter.

21
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:20,740
Okay.

22
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,730
Sir, (Choi) the captain has arrived.

23
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,330
Yes?

24
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,840
Yes.

25
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,760
A few days ago, my daughter
(Sujin) suddenly disappeared, and she seems to have disappeared.

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,010
(Sujin is not the kind of person who would ever do that.
Something must have gone wrong.

27
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,100
Three of our men were harmed
during the search, by a suspicious group.

28
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,180
Two of them were killed, and the third is in the intensive care unit.

29
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,190
As always, I think
we need your help, Director Kang.

30
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,900
Since the investigators themselves
were involved in an accident, it does sound dangerous.

31
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,190
That's why I asked Choi
Captain to come with me, and I came to you like this.

32
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,330
Yes. Don't worry too much, we'll
check it out more thoroughly.

33
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,160
(Kim) Manager, can you get something to drink?

34
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,290
Yes. Just one moment.

35
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,830
It's okay.

36
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,750
One moment, damn it...

37
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,630
I apologize.

38
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,130
Have you found anything yet?

39
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,300
We were able to pinpoint the location
from the image we immediately obtained.

40
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,600
We moved immediately.
but our men were all hurt.

41
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,430
We couldn't save Sujin.

42
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,470
Here you go, (Sharon).

43
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,720
Okay.

44
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,640
Thank you very much.

45
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,350
Thank you.

46
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,870
Yes.

47
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,190
Get in.

48
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:33,480
Yes.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,010
Would you like some water?

50
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,070
Don't worry too much. We'll do our best.

51
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,630
(Choi) Captain...

52
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,080
Can I trust these people...?

53
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,170
Yes, you can trust us.

54
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,370
We may seem a little weird.

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,470
But we are professional experts.

56
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,470
Please take good care of Sujin.

57
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,390
We will do everything we can.

58
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,390
Yes, yes.

59
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,640
Yes.

60
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,220
I brought cash this time too.

61
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,690
You didn't take anything away from it like you did
you did last time, did you?

62
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,190
Are you suspicious of a cop?

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,450
Do you know how many clients
I've brought you so far?

64
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,120
Here, give this to the boys.

65
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,620
Do you think I'm not trustworthy?

66
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,540
What's the matter? Are you refusing?

67
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,920
The situation is very serious now.

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,670
A lot of people are being killed.

69
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,500
Okay, I get it.

70
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,710
Come on

71
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,170
Guys.

72
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,720
Let's get going.

73
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,250
Recently, there have been murders by
in Seoul and other parts of the country.

74
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,460
These violent incidents continue to increase.

75
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,460
It has terrorized the hearts of many citizens.

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,710
Police suspect an
of an unknown organization behind these crimes.

77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,960
Gangs are believed to be
are also believed to be involved.

78
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,220
A special unit has been formed to investigate the matter.

79
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,830
But criminals continue to defy
authorities and brutally kill police officers...

80
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,370
In my thirty years as a police officer

81
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,880
I have not witnessed such violent cases.

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,120
People talk about demons
evil spirits, and unbelievable things happening all the time.

83
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:50,990
This is completely beyond the capabilities of the police, Father.

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,080
These people worship a high priest who summons Satan.

85
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,120
They draw supernatural power from Satan's medicines and dark energy.

86
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,930
Ordinary people can't keep up with them or beat them.

87
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,010
So, we need that kid.

88
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,490
(Mysterious words from witchcraft rituals)

89
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,700
(Mysterious words from witchcraft rituals)

90
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,620
You cursed evil spirit!

91
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,400
I command you... In the name of light!

92
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,720
Go back to the hell you came out of!

93
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,870
In the name of light... Your name has been revealed.
You are Baal, supreme commander of the armies of Hell!

94
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,090
Go right back to hell, motherfucker!

95
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,100
Go back to hell!

96
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,740
I command you... In the name of light!

97
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,870
Go back to the hell you came out of!

98
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,630
Go right back to hell, you son of a bitch!

99
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,100
I command you... Get out of this body!

100
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,700
To hell!

101
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,510
Go right back to hell, motherfucker!

102
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,590
How is it going?

103
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm fine.

104
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,750
No, I don't mean you. I mean this girl.

105
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,170
The evil spirit hasn't fully possessed her yet. She's fine.

106
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,840
This is reassuring.

107
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,470
Sir, I was a little confused earlier...

108
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,880
I couldn't film the last part. What should I do now?

109
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,180
What are we going to do, wake them all up again for this?

110
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,640
No, we can't do that.
but I think the ending needs to be documented.

111
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,970
You had to shoot well from the beginning.

112
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,650
True.

113
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,150
Is Captain Choi on his way?

114
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,730
Yes, it's coming now.

115
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:38,850
My condition has improved a lot thanks to you, Dr.
Even my shortness of breath is getting better, thank you very much.

116
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,470
That's good. But you have to keep taking the medication.

117
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,470
I will monitor your condition and gradually reduce the dosage.

118
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,220
Please check every two hours.

119
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,980
Well, I'll make sure he's stabilized.

120
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,730
Concept.

121
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,540
(Sister Catalina) Don't worry, I'm fine.

122
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm earning money to build a new
for the church, nothing more.

123
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,430
No need to thank me, it's my duty.

124
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,380
Okay, okay, I got it, (Catalina). Okay, okay.

125
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,340
Sir, we found out who
these people belonged to yesterday.

126
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,930
Really?

127
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,550
Who are they?

128
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,430
(Beelzeboth).

129
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,680
Who is the leader of these scoundrels?

130
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,890
We haven't found the High Priest yet, but I...

131
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,730
I have planted a number of undercover agents, and we will get to him soon.

132
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,230
Recently, several
first division demons such as Beelzeboth.

133
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,400
This is cause for concern.
because a bigger crisis may be on its way.

134
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,110
Even though I've encountered them repeatedly.
I still feel afraid of them.

135
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,750
We, too, are afraid.
They move with the power of Satan.

136
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,900
They are very dangerous.
So don't lose your focus, and always be careful.

137
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,940
Your future is promising, Kim, as a manager.

138
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,710
And what about me?

139
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,570
What about me?

140
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,560
Does this mean my future is dark?

141
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,060
It's hot, damn...

142
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,560
Excuse me!

143
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,310
Get out of my way.

144
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,440
I apologize.

145
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,150
Who are you?

146
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,640
What brings you here?

147
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,150
Can I see the manager?

148
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,870
Yes, I'm the manager.

149
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,410
What is it?

150
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,750
My sister is very sick.

151
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,960
I found no other way but to come here.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,880
Did Captain Choi send you?

153
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,080
No, I... (Mar...)

154
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,250
Did Father Marco send you?

155
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,930
Sorry, but I don't deal with those people.

156
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,770
I apologize.

157
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,900
My sister is in danger.

158
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,860
I will do anything if you help me.

159
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,820
I brought the money too.

160
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,860
No, the thing is...

161
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,580
No, if your sister is sick.
it's best to take her to the hospital immediately.

162
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,410
Seek a psychiatrist or neurologist.

163
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm a psychiatrist.

164
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,410
What the hell is this...

165
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,610
Wait a minute...

166
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,570
This is a recording of my sister.

167
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,710
Please hand it to him.

168
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,670
Please.

169
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,080
Uh, okay.

170
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,390
A safe haven for Onni and Onsu.

171
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,070
The garden, Ansu's safe haven.

172
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,030
Let's live here happily.
Don't fight, please.

173
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,150
Yes, no fights.

174
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,900
- And don't wear Onni's clothes.

175
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,290
And you, don't use my products.

176
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,790
As long as we don't fight, we'll live happily.

177
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,790
happily.

178
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,870
Thank you, Onni.

179
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,050
Goodbye.

180
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,210
Like it?

181
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,250
Yes.

182
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,720
The air here is very clean.

183
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,230
I'm also a doctor, and I didn't believe
what's happening to your sister until I saw it myself.

184
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,720
The Church officially bans exorcism rituals.
So I sent you to him instead of me.

185
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,940
I know that as a doctor you weren't comfortable with it either.

186
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,820
I don't know much about demons
or exorcism rituals and such.

187
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,740
I just... I want to save my sister, Father.

188
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,920
Yes?

189
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,960
Where did Sharon go?

190
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,750
I think she's in her room.

191
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,630
Sir, would you like to watch the video
that beautiful doctor sent yesterday?

192
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,560
No, no need. What the hell...

193
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,310
But if Father Marco
was the one who sent it, it must be important.

194
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,310
Don't mention Father Marco's name in front of me again, okay?

195
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,650
I apologize.

196
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,780
Where is Sharon? I have to give her this.

197
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,530
I'm here.

198
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,820
Oh my God! You scared me! When did you come?

199
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,700
Always enter with a voice, don't surprise me like this! Hey, these...

200
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,160
Here, here.

201
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,950
Here.

202
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,880
It's your paycheck.

203
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,950
Thank you.

204
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,340
Well done.

205
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,450
Thank you.

206
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,670
This is yours too, take it.

207
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,670
But why is my salary so much lower?

208
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,810
(Sharon) takes on more tasks.
and take on the hard work.

209
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,360
She even rides
the sword in the ritual, she's busy

210
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,470
Who said I ride a sword? When?

211
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,350
After all, it's hard work, so that's normal.

212
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:21,560
Here.

213
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,480
Thank you.

214
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:22,930
Take it, take it.

215
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,100
Thank you.

216
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,930
How greedy of you...

217
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,520
Just a moment, the number of demons and their followers is growing rapidly.

218
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,480
They became bolder, more public, didn't they?

219
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,450
They walked around the city center without fear.

220
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,740
And people are dying in increasing numbers, right?

221
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,230
So, our tasks have also increased, right? Right?

222
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,460
So, don't you think it's time to increase our salaries?

223
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,750
Oh my God...

224
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,850
It's been a long time. It's been ten years.

225
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,640
I'm still the same as I was then.

226
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,730
Of course, my appearance
hasn't changed since I was nineteen.

227
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,400
Your humor hasn't changed either.

228
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,320
(Han Jung Won) visited you recently, didn't she?

229
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,240
I know you said no because of what happened to me, but her sister...

230
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,740
I don't want anything to do with you anymore, Father.

231
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,410
I know you still blame me.

232
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,670
Many people lost their lives in that incident.
I suffered a lot because of it as well.

233
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,220
But I couldn't believe that Yusuf really did it.

234
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,800
(The Yusuf we know no longer exists.

235
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,060
He became a demon named Lucifer.

236
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,570
He killed all the innocent children.
and even nuns.

237
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,150
That's the demon you raised yourself.

238
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,660
I prayed for a long time with regret and tears.
asking: Is this really God's will?

239
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:12,000
Our children, all dead, and you say it's God's will?

240
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,270
Even if you don't forgive me, can't you help that girl?

241
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,400
I came to thank you myself.

242
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,490
If it wasn't for you (Sharon), I wouldn't have been able to see my son's face for the last time.
to see my son's face for the last time.

243
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,920
If only we had arrived a little earlier...

244
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:57,880
It's okay. I'm grateful that we were able to find his body.

245
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,420
and to give rest to his soul. I will not forget this favor.

246
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,240
to turn it off

247
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,850
This is Sharon.

248
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,910
Seven years ago.
The director saved us from a demon that almost killed us.

249
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,280
That day, he saved us from Lucifer, me and Sharon.
and even Sister Catalina.

250
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,300
If the manager hadn't helped us that day.
we would have been dead by now.

251
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,530
If we have someone to help us, we don't have to be afraid.

252
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,930
Let's help Dr. Onsu.

253
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,220
I also really want to help that doctor.

254
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,250
Thirty-fourth day of monitoring Unsu.

255
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,250
Unsu's symptoms were caused by
A panic attack following the death of her only mother

256
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,160
After a long battle with cancer.

257
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,650
where she exhibited symptoms of panic disorder.

258
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,880
In addition to later moving to a
an isolated country house with a strange environment.

259
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,620
and the stress of preparing for exams

260
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,450
All day alone at home

261
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,510
It seems to have caused a cumulative
that led to her condition.

262
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,330
(Unsu), it's time to eat.

263
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,640
(Unsu)...

264
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,310
(Forget)? Don't forget too quickly!

265
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,370
(Sister), I have a good feeling this time.

266
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,960
something beautiful.

267
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,190
Package receipt

268
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,690
I'll put it here.

269
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,130
(Forget it)!

270
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,660
(Forget it)!

271
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,430
Full lighting.

272
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,590
(Forget it)!

273
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,300
(Forget it)!

274
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,970
Where are you now?

275
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,370
(Forget it)!

276
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,650
(Forget it)!

277
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,520
Yes, this is Emergency 119, go ahead.

278
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
I apologize.

279
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,580
(Forget it)!

280
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,290
What are you doing there?

281
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,290
(Forget it)!

282
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,790
Are you okay?

283
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,150
(Forget it)!

284
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,570
(Forget it)! No, no

285
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,700
Recently, the
damage caused by an unidentified group

286
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,130
So far, more than thirty policemen have been killed.

287
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,940
(Kim), office manager.

288
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,940
Yes, sir.

289
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,790
Let me see that clip.

290
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,740
Infernal Fire falls from the sky! These demons

291
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,570
My sister...

292
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,930
Despite multiple treatment attempts, the

293
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,980
It's my fault, because I couldn't
to come back like I should have to save my sister.

294
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,210
See here.

295
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:44,190
I found another clip, but it shows an even bigger issue.

296
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,370
I am very grateful to you.

297
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,170
The homeowner has to make this effort
if he wants to rent it out. (Capso is not the neglected type.

298
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:02,590
We cleaned most of the stuff.
but the really big stuff

299
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,370
We put it in storage

300
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,970
Are you done?

301
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,430
Yes. We checked the cameras
surveillance cameras and the entire smart security system.

302
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,370
Look at this.

303
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,150
It seems that what happened to Unsu
has something to do with Bishop Lucifer again.

304
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,480
(Yusuf)...

305
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,370
We had a boy named Yusuf with us at the orphanage.

306
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,210
Three years younger than Pau.

307
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,490
The late nun (Angela) raised them as if they were her own children.

308
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,680
They were among the chosen few from a young age.

309
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,420
(Bao) had a physical strength
As his name implies, he was tough as nails.

310
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:58,560
As for Joseph, he had the ability to
exorcise demons from people's bodies and save them.

311
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,570
The other children feared and shunned him.

312
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:11,100
But Bao always protected him.
They were as close as real brothers.

313
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,410
(Yusuf chose the path of the priesthood to exorcize spirits.
while Bao, after leaving the house

314
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,480
He worked in the underworld using his fist
to make money, and still took care of Yusuf and the house.

315
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,760
He used to visit the home every Christmas, but...
Fifteen years ago, on that day, Yusuf

316
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,930
He summoned a demon and caused the death of the nun (Angela)

317
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:40,750
and all the children, and then he disappeared.

318
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,930
Everyone thought that Bao
had died, but he came back in a miraculous way.

319
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,520
He came back to life, and from then on, Bao felt guilty that he couldn't save those who were like family to him.

320
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,140
With his guilt and desire for revenge.

321
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,960
He started chasing the disappeared Yusuf.
and eliminated the demons one by one.

322
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,170
Back then, Yusuf was
trying to absorb people's souls

323
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,900
to strengthen the forces of evil in him, but I was stupid
I didn't want to believe that Yusuf had become like that.

324
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,480
Therefore, I could not tell the
the group the truth about that incident.

325
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,280
Meanwhile, Yusuf disappeared.
and when Bao later learned of this.

326
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,620
I think the reason he rejected your request was because of me.

327
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,250
Hello?

328
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,120
Yes.

329
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,710
I am Kang Bao, director of the Holy Night Foundation.

330
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Can you meet with me for a bit if your time permits?

331
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,250
The exorcism ritual will be performed by Sharon here.

332
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,690
She (Kim) will be assisted by the office manager during the weather.

333
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,110
I apologize for not informing you earlier, but in such

334
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,110
In some cases, so-called demons and their followers may appear

335
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,120
anytime and anywhere around Onsu.
so I have to be ready to deal with them.

336
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,160
These possess
a special ability to detect the presence of demons.

337
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,670
She knows how to fight them better than anyone.

338
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,290
Please just show them your eyes shift for a moment.

339
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,010
Show us, even if only for a moment.

340
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,830
I will, but not now.

341
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,800
Okay.

342
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:10,150
It's a very dangerous job.
so Unsu and the doctor may be in danger.

343
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,400
We are, after all, always risking our lives in this business.

344
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,220
Are you willing to try though?

345
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,120
Yes. If it saves my sister's life, I will.

346
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:32,500
Our lives are also at risk...
Anyway, Kim, prepare the briefing.

347
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,590
What we know for sure
is that a demon is inhabiting Onsu's body.

348
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,980
Why is all this happening to Unsu in particular?

349
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,310
Have you let any strangers into the house recently?

350
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,810
No, we live in an isolated place, almost no one comes here.

351
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,500
Look.

352
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,610
It looks like someone summoned a demon through Onsu.

353
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:03,580
We also can't
confirm their identity until we see the mark ourselves.

354
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,080
They appear as normal people among us all the time.

355
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,290
We call them "worshippers." They worship the devil.

356
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,540
They submit to it, and spread mischief and evil among the people.

357
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,760
Especially the so-called guards among them, they are trained like soldiers

358
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,760
to mercilessly kill anyone who gets in their way.

359
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,260
Those who are called demons
They are like bishops who rule each region.

360
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,550
They are no longer human, but more like demons.

361
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,230
They are the ones who choose the offerings and conduct
all satanic rituals at the behest of their elder.

362
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,400
But why Unsu?

363
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,190
For thousands of years, they have been targeting
pure and wounded souls like Unsu

364
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,140
to summon demons through it, and build their own dark world.

365
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,170
Anyone can be victimized.

366
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,420
We have to meet Unsu.

367
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,260
(Unsu)...

368
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,300
Have you regained consciousness a little?

369
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,050
Do you hear my voice?

370
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,390
Yes.

371
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,480
Sister came to help you.

372
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,310
Can you talk to me for a bit?

373
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,270
Yes.

374
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,610
Is anyone else talking to you right now?

375
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:24,980
Yes.

376
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,640
Who is that person?

377
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,710
I don't know.

378
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,140
I may not say.

379
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,650
Can I talk to him for a bit?

380
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,580
No, it is not allowed.

381
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,550
Why not?

382
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,980
Because it's scary.

383
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,510
If I talk to him and he talks back.

384
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,810
It will leave your body.

385
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,440
Isn't that what you wish for too?

386
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,500
I...

387
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,720
I'm so scared...

388
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,520
I'll start now.

389
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,100
Who are you?

390
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,370
Answer me.

391
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,760
Who are you?

392
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,180
Answer me!

393
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,580
Don't hide behind the child, answer me.

394
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,660
Who are you?

395
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,070
Why are you doing this to me?

396
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,620
I didn't do anything wrong!

397
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,030
You damned devil!

398
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,810
State your name now!

399
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,750
Go back to hell!

400
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,590
You evil demon!

401
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,620
Reveal your name immediately!

402
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,960
Go back to hell, right now!

403
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,320
No!

404
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,700
You evil demon!

405
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,690
Reveal your name now

406
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,080
Go back to hell.

407
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,650
You evil demon!

408
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,290
Reveal your name now

409
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,960
Go back to hell, right now!

410
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,530
Reveal your name immediately!

411
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,180
To hell

412
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,710
(Unsu) is here, but where are you now?

413
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,980
We are at the entrance.

414
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,420
What do we do now?

415
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,240
It looks like she's trying to get out.

Get out!

420
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,400
Run away!

421
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,020

422
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,330

424
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,780

425
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,550

426
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,430

(Unsu)! (Unsu)!

428
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,640
(Unsu)!

429
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,510
(Unsu), there is danger!

430
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,610
(Unsu), no! I'm coming, just wait a bit!

431
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,320
My sister... I'm so scared...

432
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,630

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,870

434
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,170
My sister!

436
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,540

438
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,250
Uncle!

439
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,080
(Zhongxin)! Are you okay?

440
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,420
Sir, are you hurt?

441
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:38,710
No.

442
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,690
The devil inside Unsu has settled very deeply.

443
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,270
We cannot identify him.

444
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,720
I think we should end
in the house where it all began.

445
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,320
If I stay in the hospital.
Unsu and the others will be in danger.

446
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,020
Yes. We will do it.

447
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,640
Let's hurry up. We don't have time.

448
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,810
(Unsu).

449
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,060
Let's hang in there a little longer, okay?

450
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,710
Damn...

451
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,850
We don't know where these bastards will show up from...

452
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,570
No matter what you do, it won't work.

453
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,490
(Forget it)!

454
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,200
Save me!

455
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,680
I will save you no matter what.

456
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,370
The exorcism ritual consists of six stages.

457
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,940
At every stage, the goal
is to force the demon to reveal its name

458
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,210
so that we can expel it from Unsu's body.

459
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:48,130
You must follow my instructions precisely at every stage.

460
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,990
Once the weather starts, there's no stopping.

461
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:59,860
If we stop, Unsu's life
and all of our lives will be in danger.

462
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,400
The first stage: Existence.
We show the existence of evil.

463
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,590
My sister...

464
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,310
I'm so scared...

465
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,540
Fire them all...

466
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,220
I'm scared, sister...

467
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,310
(Forget it), it's okay.

468
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,330
(Joonwon), don't answer.

469
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,450
(Kim), have you finished your preparations?

470
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:31,780
Yes.

471
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,280
(Joon Won)...

472
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,830
(Joon Won)?

473
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,370
If I call you, you have to answer.

474
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,140
Yes?

475
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,380
Start the devices.

476
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,800
Okay.

477
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,660
Vital signs are within normal range.

478
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,480
Let's get started.

479
00:50:55,430 --> 00:51:01,090
From now on, answer
every question I ask. Otherwise, you will be in pain

480
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:07,310
Don't touch my body! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

481
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,860
State your name!

482
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,730
Say your name!

483
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,950
What happened?

484
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,280
We have now entered the camouflage phase.

485
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,900
From now on, Satan will try to deceive us.

486
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,850
My sister...

487
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,780
I'm so scared... Please free me from this...

Would you like to know my name?

Did he tell you?

495
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,740

Something strange is happening.

506
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:04,280
I'll go check, keep it up.

507
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,660

This is the powder they are spraying. You have to be careful.

00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,380
Yes.

532
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,680
Now we are in the third stage: Resistance phase.

533
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,060
(Joonwon), it's best to rest a bit now.

534
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,090
(Joon Won)...

535
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,120
(Joon Won), are you okay?

536
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,710
I command you in the name of the Supreme God and the Three Holy Gods

537
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,220
Now return immediately to your world

538
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,340
Go back now.

539
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,200
(Joon Won)! (Joon Won), wake up! (Joon Won)!

540
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,470
It's okay. You're okay now.

541
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,890
She was possessed by a demon for a moment.

542
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:26,440
During the ritual, the
to target family members as well.

543
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,370
There seems to be something else in the house.

544
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:18,950
(Mysterious words from witchcraft rituals)

545
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,280
Hey.

546
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,280
Yes.

547
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,460
Do not read them.

548
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,760
Okay.

549
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,830
What does it mean?

550
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,860
I'm not sure.

551
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,850
It's in an ancient language called Igbo.

552
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,940
Because of this, unexpected things started to happen.

553
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
The whole house is under a curse.

554
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,660
And what should we do?

555
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,830
We have to remove all those symbols.

556
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:54,400
(Cryptic words from witchcraft rituals)

557
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,080
What happened to me?

558
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:28,180
It felt like something had come out of my body.

559
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,150
(Unsu, are you okay?

560
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,480
Has she regained consciousness a little?

561
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,750
Wait...

562
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:36,030
My sister...

563
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,810
Please untie me...

564
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,370
Are you really Unsu? Do you know who I am?

565
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:48,340
Wait...

566
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:12,520
No matter what you do, this girl will eventually die.

567
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,760
Do you remember?

568
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:21,480
I made those poor kids die.

569
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:25,860
The sound stage has begun.

570
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:35,100
Uncle, please save me, please!

571
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,800
Save me, please!

572
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,550
(Yusuf) is the one who killed them?

573
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,270
No, you killed them.

574
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,520
Because you didn't feed Joseph, all the children died.

575
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:59,150
Come on, come with me to meet the Master.

576
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,570
Only then will you have eternal life.

577
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:04,860
If she doesn't, she dies... and so does this child.

578
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:08,400
She also killed your mother, the nun (Angela).

579
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,520
Read it!

580
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,270
Are you okay...

581
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,410
I'm fine.

582
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,030
Don't be fooled by them.

Your ability to...

586
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,800
It didn't come from that asshole.

"Didn't you get that from my brother?"

588
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,650
That my ability originated from your brother...

589
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:57,310
This is proof that the bastard couldn't beat me.

590
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:06,590
Do you think you can
 to withstand that power any longer?

591
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,320
She is here.

592
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,140
What is this thing?

593
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,900
Cover.

594
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,940
And why did you bring the lid?

595
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,080
Didn't you ask me to get it?

596
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,070
I said get a thick coat! Damn it, I said "coat".

597
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,590
And why is your life...important?

598
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,640
You're wasting it for these insignificant humans?!

599
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,710
Whenever you summon your invisible powers...

600
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,080
Your body is dying... Can't you feel it?

601
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,520
As you have tasted this torment before...

602
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,360
Greedy, corrupt humans... don't deserve your survival!

603
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,620
Are they worth sacrificing for?!

604
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,000
Join us... our sister.

605
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,750
Let's stay together...

606
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,610
I am not your sister. And I will not be!

607
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:44,930
Get out of my mind right now, motherfucker!

608
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,670
Say your name!

609
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,440
I will end this torment.

610
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,230
Tell me your name now!

611
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:06,770

616
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,950
Stop! Enough of this!

617
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:28,960

618
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,960

This girl is now mine.

623
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,410
Get out of my way!

624
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,800
It's a collision course now.

625

We need to find Unsu quickly.

Move out of the way.

631
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,310
Damn... The house has been damaged a lot.

632
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:23,120

Are you okay?

639
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:45,590
Are you okay?

640
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:47,780
I'm fine.

641
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,530

What is it?

(Unsah) gradually turns into a demon.

647
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:02,800
Come back to us! No, no!

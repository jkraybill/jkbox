23
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:26,402
<font size="71">They must be executing
Shibata's spies.</font>

24
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:30,691
<font size="71">I need to sell all this
before the fighting starts.</font>

25
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:33,436
<font size="71">Can you sell it in Nagahama?</font>

26
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,279
<font size="71">I hear business is booming there
since Lord Hashiba's forces arrived.</font>

<font size="71">Go, then, if that's what you want!
Some samurai you'll make, you fool!</font>

You can't even handle a sword.</font>

34
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:10,688
<font size="71">You should stick to the trade you know
or you'll regret it.</font>

35
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,645
<font size="71">Just wait until I'm rich.</font>

36

I'm tired of being poor.</font>

<font size="71">Genjuro, please take me with you.</font>

38
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:22,237
<font size="71">Still at it?
Forget your foolish dreams.</font>

39
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:25,998
<font size="71">- Let me pull the cart.
- Stop it, you fool!</font>

40
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:30,792
<font size="71">He's delusional, he thinks a big future
awaits him in Nagahama.</font>

41
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,668
<font size="71">What an idiot!</font>

42
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,755
<font size="71">Back soon, Miyagi.</font>

43
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:04,621
<font size="71">They're too greedy for their own good.
And not just Tobei. Genjuro, too.</font>

44
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:11,004
<font size="71">I tell you, quick profits made
in chaotic times never last.</font>

45
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,995
<font size="71">A little money inflames men's greed.</font>

46
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:19,969
<font size="71">They'd do better
to prepare for the coming war.</font>

47
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:25,642
<font size="71">- Tell Genjuro that when he returns.
- I shall.</font>

48
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,516
<font size="71">Thank you for your advice.</font>

49
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,777
<font size="71">Your father's back!</font>

50
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:45,372
<font size="71">Welcome back.</font>

51
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:49,083
<font size="71">Here …</font>

52
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,246
<font size="71">Look!</font>

53
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:56,384
<font size="71">- What's this?
- What do you think?</font>

54
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,964
<font size="71">You got that for your wares?</font>

55
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:02,839
<font size="71">Feel the weight of it.</font>

56
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:07,348
<font size="71">Never seen so much, have you?
I hurried back just to show you.</font>

57
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:14,357
<font size="71">That's what I call trade!
Now do you understand?</font>

58
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,816
<font size="71">What about Tobei?</font>

59
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:25,315
<font size="71">He came across a fine-looking
samurai in Nagahama.</font>

60
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,449
<font size="71">I tried to stop him, but he insisted
on following the samurai.</font>

61
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,863
<font size="71">I beg of you, sir! I beg of you!</font>

62
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,776
<font size="71">Please, I beg of you, sir!</font>

63
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:09,115
<font size="71">Let me be your vassal!
I'll serve you unto death, sir!</font>

64
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:14,583
<font size="71">- Accept a beggar as a vassal?
- Get some armour first!</font>

65
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,087
<font size="71">- Armour and a spear!
- Get lost, beggar!</font>

66
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,340
<font size="71">Then can I be a samurai?</font>

67
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:22,473
<font size="71">Get lost!</font>

68
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,596
<font size="71">Not you again?</font>

69
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,978
<font size="71">Get some armour and a spear!</font>

70
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:53,042
<font size="71">You look so nice!
Happy now?</font>

71
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:57,247
<font size="71">Very smart indeed.</font>

72
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:05,335
<font size="71">It's like the Bon festival
and New Year's all rolled into one.</font>

73
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:13,063
<font size="71">For years I've wanted to buy you
a kimono but I could never afford it.</font>

74
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:15,182
<font size="71">Now I finally can!</font>

75
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,810
<font size="71">Just look at your face.
You look so happy!</font>

76
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,650
<font size="71">It's not the kimono but your kindness
that makes me so happy.</font>

77
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,409
<font size="71">As long as you're with me,
I want for nothing in life.</font>

78
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:45,091
<font size="71">Just look at all this …</font>

79
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:52,300
<font size="71">Dried fish, oil, flour,
arrowroot and rice cakes.</font>

80
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,849
<font size="71">Money is everything, see?</font>

81
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:58,064
<font size="71">Without it life is hard,</font>

82
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:01,105
<font size="71">and all hope dies.</font>

83
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:07,991
<font size="71">Well, your father's got work to do.</font>

84
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,952
<font size="71">Up we go.</font>

85
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:13,493
<font size="71">I will earn even more.</font>

86
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,330
<font size="71">I'll try and make
as much pottery as I can.</font>

87
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:24,378
<font size="71">That last small batch
brought in three silver coins.</font>

88
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:28,723
<font size="71">That's enough talk of money.
We have plenty now.</font>

89
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:34,431
<font size="71">The village chief says Lord Shibata's
troops could be here by tomorrow.</font>

90
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:36,425
<font size="71">We should be careful …</font>

91
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:38,177
<font size="71">Nonsense!</font>

92
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:41,689
<font size="71">War's always good for business.
Just look how much I made!</font>

93
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:46,652
<font size="71">You were fortunate once.
You may not be next time.</font>

94
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:50,855
<font size="71">- If anything happened to you …
- Stop imagining the worst.</font>

95
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:52,908
<font size="71">Oh, Ohama …</font>

96
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:58,081
<font size="71">- Brother …
- You mustn't worry.</font>

97
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:02,043
<font size="71">No samurai would hire
a peasant dressed in rags like him.</font>

98
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,786
<font size="71">Don't you worry, he'll be back.</font>

99
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,339
<font size="71">Have something to drink, here.</font>

100
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:18,894
<font size="71">You fool!</font>

101
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,350
<font size="71">Have you come to your senses?</font>

102
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:25,018
<font size="71">You look like a beggar.</font>

103
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:27,977
<font size="71">You've become the village idiot!</font>

104
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,680
<font size="71">Keep it turning, come on.</font>

105
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,220
<font size="71">Get him out of here!
He's in the way.</font>

106
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:00,517
<font size="71">We won't make it if we don't hurry.</font>

107
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:04,691
<font size="71">Stay out of the way, now.
Go and sit down.</font>

108
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:09,187
<font size="71">Mother, I'm hungry.</font>

109
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,526
<font size="71">What a pest!</font>

110
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,703
<font size="71">Come on, come on,
a few more turns!</font>

111
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:23,246
<font size="71">You're a different man now,</font>

112
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:26,212
<font size="71">always so irritable.</font>

113
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:31,463
<font size="71">All I want is for us to work
in peace as husband and wife,</font>

114
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:36,011
<font size="71">and for the three of us to live happily.</font>

115
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:39,507
<font size="71">That's all I wish for.</font>

116
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,259
<font size="71">You really worked hard for me this time.</font>

117
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,513
<font size="71">I have a plan, that's why.</font>

118
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:27,806
<font size="71">Let's sell this new batch in Nagahama.
We'll make a fortune.</font>

119
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:33,106
<font size="71">- Will I get a share?
- Of course. A third of all we sell.</font>

120
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:37,153
<font size="71">I can't wait … I can't wait
to get my hands on that money.</font>

121
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:47,458
<font size="71">I've never seen those two
work so hard before.</font>

122
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:53,802
<font size="71">They've thrown
everything into this kiln,</font>

123
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:58,551
<font size="71">their strength, their souls, everything.</font>

124
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:04,559
<font size="71">I don't know what will become of them
if it all fails.</font>

125
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,480
<font size="71">Living together as a happy family
is enough for me.</font>

126
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:15,152
<font size="71">But he insists on taking this risk.
Men just won't listen, will they?</font>

127
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:18,485
<font size="71">Genjuro was always
so level-headed before.</font>

128
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:21,452
<font size="71">War changes people, doesn't it?</font>

129
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:25,043
<font size="71">At least they're trying
to bring in some money.</font>

130
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:28,368
<font size="71">I wonder what that is.</font>

131
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:36,803
<font size="71">Wake up, dear. Wake up.</font>

132
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,350
<font size="71">The rumour was true.
They must be Shibata's troops.</font>

133
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:53,897
<font size="71">See anything, Tobei?</font>

134
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:57,992
<font size="71">The villagers are scattering like spiders!</font>

135
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,410
<font size="71">- What now?
- We must keep the kiln burning.</font>

136
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:05,831
<font size="71">I'll be damned if I let that fire go out.</font>

137
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:09,711
<font size="71">They're pillaging houses
and rounding up men.</font>

138
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,170
<font size="71">Genichi!</font>

139
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,922
<font size="71">Genichi!</font>

140
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,549
<font size="71">It's Shibata's army! Hurry, run!</font>

141
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:27,428
<font size="71">Hurry, hurry!</font>

142
00:14:31,852 --> 00:14:33,942
<font size="71">Hurry!</font>

143
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:46,164
<font size="71">Halt! We're taking men
for forced labour! Don't try to resist!</font>

Lord Shibata's troops are here!</font>

145
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:57,535
<font size="71">They're stealing everything!
Hide your valuables!</font>

146
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:01,169
<font size="71">- Don't let them get your women!
- Hurry!</font>

147
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,588
<font size="71">They're taking all men
into forced labour!</font>

148
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:08,968
<font size="71">- They're requisitioning everything!
- They're like a pack of wolves.</font>

149

It's too dangerous here. Hurry!</font>

I won't get my share of the profits!</font>

152
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,409
<font size="71">You'll lose your life for that kiln!
Come on!</font>

153
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,083
<font size="71">Come now, quickly!</font>

154
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:35,833
<font size="71">Boil some rice.
We'll need it in the mountains.</font>

156
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,634
<font size="71">Mother!</font>

157
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:03,073
<font size="71">Trying to hide, eh?
Come out, damn you!</font>

158
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,619
<font size="71">Help! Please! Help!</font>

159
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:22,002

<font size="71">No, please! No!</font>

162
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,928
<font size="71">Out of my way!</font>

163
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:36,226
<font size="71">Out of the way, fool!</font>

164
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,281
<font size="71">Help!</font>

165
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:35,077
<font size="71">It's ready. Here …</font>

166
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,035
<font size="71">Thank you.</font>

167
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,130
<font size="71">Hurry and eat.</font>

168
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:53,506

171
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,780
<font size="71">It's really quietened down.</font>

172
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,539
<font size="71">The guns are almost silent.</font>

173
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,838
<font size="71">Where are you going?</font>

174
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:18,598
<font size="71">It's too dangerous.
Wait until the soldiers leave.</font>

175
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,772
<font size="71">Wait. It's best to wait.</font>

176
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,061
<font size="71">I can't wait! I have to go!</font>

177
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:26,345
<font size="71">- Please don't go!
- I can't let the fire go out!</font>

178
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
<font size="71">Forget the kiln!
What if you're caught?</font>

179
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:35,319
<font size="71">- I can't let the fire go out!
- We can always make more pots.</font>

180
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:38,827
<font size="71">Silence!
I can't let the pots be ruined.</font>

181
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,370
<font size="71">Ohama! Ohama!</font>

182
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:03,095
<font size="71">Damn it! The fire's gone out.</font>

183
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,446
<font size="71">- Dear …
- Too late. The fire's gone out.</font>

184
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:29,079
<font size="71">Damn, it's empty!</font>

185
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:36,627
<font size="71">- What was that? Is someone hiding?
- Could be something hidden in there.</font>

186
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:39,088
<font size="71">Have a look.</font>

187
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:02,409
<font size="71">Nothing but pots.</font>

188
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,414
<font size="71">Let's go.</font>

189
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,730
<font size="71">They're done!</font>

190
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:40,074
<font size="71">Look! They're fired!</font>

191
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:44,076
<font size="71">Thank goodness they're done!</font>

192
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
<font size="71">They're done!</font>

193
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,372
<font size="71">Thank goodness.</font>

194
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:52,168
<font size="71">Are they done?</font>

195
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:55,842
<font size="71">Yes, they are!
And very nicely, too.</font>

196
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:59,172
<font size="71">- Hurry and load them up.
- So we're off to Nagahama, then?</font>

197
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,549
<font size="71">We can't now.
We'll row across the lake.</font>

198
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:07,097
<font size="71">Ohama's a boatman's daughter.
You do the rowing, okay?</font>

199
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:11,393
<font size="71">- Can we get to the lake safely?
- We'll take a shortcut to Onoe.</font>

200
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,439
<font size="71">Will we find a boat?</font>

201
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:16,523
<font size="71">There are always
abandoned ones there.</font>

202
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,030
<font size="71">Hurry, let's unload the kiln.</font>

203
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:12,435
<font size="71"><i>In the waters of Azuchi</i></font>

204
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:34,843
<font size="71"><i>A little boat floats along</i></font>

205
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:45,937
<font size="71"><i>All are asleep</i></font>

206
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,540
<font size="71"><i>Slumped over the rudder …</i></font>

207
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,747
<font size="71">We've got to be careful, the fog is thick.</font>

208
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:07,216
<font size="71">Genichi, this is the lake.
Isn't it beautiful?</font>

209
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:12,135
<font size="71">We're finally out of danger.</font>

210
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:15,555
<font size="71">I'm glad we decided to go by boat.</font>

211
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:18,935
<font size="71">If we'd gone over land,
we'd probably be dead by now.</font>

212
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:21,653
<font size="71">We'll reach Omizo by morning.</font>

213
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:25,945
<font size="71">That's where Lord Niwa
has his castle.</font>

214
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,240
<font size="71">The town's even more prosperous
than Nagahama.</font>

215
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:32,485
<font size="71">You and I will be rich men,</font>

216
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:35,749
<font size="71">and our wives will be wealthy women.</font>

217
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:41,094
<font size="71">I'll build a warehouse in our village.</font>

218
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,551
<font size="71">And I'll buy a suit of armour.</font>

219
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:17,502
<font size="71">Another boat!</font>

220
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,677
<font size="71">It's a ghost!</font>

221
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:35,425
<font size="71">No … I'm not a ghost.</font>

222
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,399
<font size="71">I'm a boatman from Kaizu.</font>

223
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:46,032
<font size="71">I was on the way
to Azuchi with my cargo,</font>

224
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:49,783
<font size="71">when I was attacked by pirates.</font>

225
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:53,031
<font size="71">Water …</font>

226
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,242
<font size="71">Give me water!</font>

227
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,536
<font size="71">Thank you.</font>

228
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:21,515
<font size="71">Wherever you're headed,
be on the lookout for pirates.</font>

229
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:25,151
<font size="71">If they see you,</font>

230
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:29,073
<font size="71">you'll lose your cargo and your lives.</font>

231
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:33,322
<font size="71">Take care of your women.</font>

232
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:34,988
<font size="71">Your women …</font>

233
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:51,047
<font size="71">Merciful Buddha!</font>

234
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:57,467
<font size="71">Buddha have mercy on his soul.</font>

235
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:08,018
<font size="71">Let's turn back.
This is a bad omen.</font>

236
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:16,158
<font size="71">Let's return the women to shore.
We'll continue alone.</font>

237
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:20,082
<font size="71">- Please don't go.
- I'm staying … to keep my eye on him.</font>

238
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,543
<font size="71">- They kidnap women.
- I'll risk it.</font>

239
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:26,334
<font size="71">I'll go wherever you go.
Please take me with you.</font>

240
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,839
<font size="71">- You must look after Genichi.
- Take me with you!</font>

241
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:34,383
<font size="71">Ohama, take us back to shore.
Quickly!</font>

242
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:37,549
<font size="71">Tobei, take us back!</font>

243
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:57,911
<font size="71">We'll be back with the money soon.</font>

244
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:01,912
<font size="71">We'll return within ten days.
Wait for us.</font>

245
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:07,833
<font size="71">Don't try to fight
if pirates overtake you.</font>

246
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:11,709
<font size="71">I know, I know.
Don't take the main road.</font>

247
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:15,128
<font size="71">Remember what I said
and take the mountain path.</font>

248
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:18,298
<font size="71">And don't go back home right away.
Understand?</font>

249
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:22,348
<font size="71">These misfortunes will soon be over.
Just be patient.</font>

250
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,896
<font size="71">Tobei, Ohama,
please look after him for me.</font>

251
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:30,651
<font size="71">Don't worry, we'll be back soon.</font>

252
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:33,233
<font size="71">Take good care of Genichi.</font>

00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:43,544
<font size="71">Let me go!</font>

290
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:47,761
<font size="71">What are you doing?</font>

291
00:33:48,507 --> 00:33:50,427
<font size="71">Damn you!</font>

292
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,394
<font size="71">Murderers!</font>

293
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,287
<font size="71">There's some money for you.</font>

294
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:44,001
<font size="71">Bastards!</font>

295
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:50,003
<font size="71">Look what's become of me.</font>

296
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:54,928
<font size="71">Satisfied now, Tobei,
seeing your wife reduced to this?</font>

297
00:35:56,594 --> 00:36:01,604
<font size="71">What do you care, anyway,
now you think you're a samurai?</font>

298
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:04,394
<font size="71">Tobei, you wretched fool!</font>

299
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:08,518
<font size="71">You fool, Tobei!</font>

300
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:41,182
<font size="71">Would you watch over my stall
until my partners return?</font>

301
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:45,845
<font size="71">- Of course.
- They should be back soon. Thanks.</font>

302
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:18,128
<font size="71">Sir, how much is one of these?</font>

303
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:21,099
<font size="71">Are you looking to buy?</font>

304
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,060
<font size="71">Depends on the price.</font>

305
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:28,191
<font size="71">They're too luxurious
for the wife of a man like you.</font>

306
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,310
<font size="71">I've got money.</font>

307
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:32,122
<font size="71">Excuse me.</font>

308
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:39,085
<font size="71">We thought you might need us
to show you the way.</font>

309
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:42,344
<font size="71">That's very kind of you.</font>

310
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:50,351
<font size="71">Please follow us.</font>

311
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:17,859
<font size="71">Please come in.</font>

312
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,820
<font size="71">Well … Thank you,
but I should be getting back.</font>

313
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:27,994
<font size="71">Lady Wakasa is waiting for you.
Please come inside.</font>

314
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:33,745
<font size="71">You say "Lady Wakasa"…
Are you referring to the young lady?</font>

315
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:37,791
<font size="71">Yes, she is the daughter
of the late Lord Kutsuki.</font>

316
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:42,376
<font size="71">Now please come through.
No need to stand on ceremony.</font>

317
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:26,421
<font size="71">Many thanks.</font>

318
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:36,515
<font size="71">Come through.</font>

319
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:45,784
<font size="71">Please …</font>

320
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:04,145
<font size="71">Please, come.</font>

321
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:20,624
<font size="71">You are Master Genjuro
of Omi province, are you not?</font>

322
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:27,593
<font size="71">How does your ladyship
know my name?</font>

323
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:33,974
<font size="71">When I saw your ceramics
at the market,</font>

324
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:37,142
<font size="71">I could hardly believe my eyes.</font>

325
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:44,143
<font size="71">The blue glaze on your pots
gleamed as brightly as crystal.</font>

326
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:52,283
<font size="71">My father taught me
a certain appreciation of such things.</font>

327
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:56,819
<font size="71">I wanted to meet you,</font>

328
00:43:56,949 --> 00:44:01,539
<font size="71">to ask how you manage
to create such beautiful objects.</font>

329
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:06,082
<font size="71">But perhaps it is a trade secret,
not meant for outsiders?</font>

330
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:10,208
<font size="71">No, my lady,
there is no special trade secret.</font>

331
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:16,087
<font size="71">But it takes many years' experience
to handle the clay and apply the glaze.</font>

332
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:21,178
<font size="71">The fruit of experience is beauty,</font>

333
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:26,726
<font size="71">but only a master craftsman
can create such beauty.</font>

334
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:28,483
<font size="71">Thank you, my lady.</font>

335
00:44:56,633 --> 00:45:00,103
<font size="71">These are my wares, aren't they?</font>

336
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:08,484
<font size="71">I wanted to taste <i>sake</i>
from your cups.</font>

337
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:14,901
<font size="71">You're fortunate, my little ones,
to catch this noble lady's eye.</font>

338
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:21,776
<font size="71">I'm a farmer,
so the pottery is just a sideline,</font>

339
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:26,908
<font size="71">but I feel for my creations,
as if they were my own children.</font>

340
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:33,665
<font size="71">That such a noble lady would look
kindly upon them is a great honour.</font>

341
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:40,045
<font size="71">To see them
in such a grand residence,</font>

342
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:43,887
<font size="71">graced by the touch
of so beautiful a lady,</font>

343
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:47,728
<font size="71">is like a dream come true.</font>

344
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:52,861
<font size="71">Not at all. They must be
saddened by the touch</font>

345
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:56,151
<font size="71">of one fallen on hard times,
such as myself.</font>

346
00:45:56,276 --> 00:45:58,856
<font size="71">Please, take a cup.</font>

347
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:06,575
<font size="71">My wares have never looked
so beautiful.</font>

348
00:46:16,713 --> 00:46:22,393
<font size="71">The value of people and objects
truly depends on their setting.</font>

349
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:27,971
<font size="71">My wares must be at a loss to find
themselves in such a noble manor.</font>

350
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,610
<font size="71">Your talent must not be hidden away
in some poor, remote village.</font>

351
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:40,321
<font size="71">You must strive to deepen
and enrich your gift.</font>

352
00:46:43,532 --> 00:46:47,082
<font size="71">And how might I do that, my lady?</font>

353
00:46:48,578 --> 00:46:51,958
<font size="71">By swearing your love
for Lady Wakasa,</font>

354
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:55,462
<font size="71">and pledging your troth to her at once.</font>

355
00:48:04,738 --> 00:48:14,738
<font size="71"><i>The finest silk</i></font>

356
00:48:15,832 --> 00:48:24,882
<font size="71"><i>Of choicest hue</i></font>

357
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:37,052
<font size="71"><i>May change and fade a way</i></font>

358
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:58,281
<font size="71"><i>As would my life</i></font>

359
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:09,300
<font size="71"><i>My beloved</i></font>

360
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:21,221
<font size="71"><i>If thou shouldst prove untrue</i></font>

361
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:48,707
<font size="71"><i>Our vow to love</i>
<i>for a thousand years …</i></font>

362
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:05,823
<font size="71"><i>Is sealed with this cup …</i></font>

363
00:50:43,938 --> 00:50:47,108
<font size="71">His voice sounds overjoyed!</font>

364
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:55,026
<font size="71">That is the voice of my late father.</font>

365
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:09,262
<font size="71">The entire House of Kutsuki
was wiped out</font>

366
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:15,391
<font size="71">by Oda Nobunaga,
that detestable Oda Nobunaga.</font>

367
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:21,018
<font size="71">The only survivors of the purge
were her ladyship</font>

368
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:24,352
<font size="71">and myself, her nurse.</font>

369
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:31,529
<font size="71">But the spirit of the late <i>daimyo</i>
lingers in the palace,</font>

370
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:38,243
<font size="71">and it sings like this
every time her ladyship dances.</font>

371
00:51:40,787 --> 00:51:45,457
<font size="71">Is it not a splendid voice?</font>

372
00:51:48,628 --> 00:51:53,878
<font size="71">He's expressing his delight
at her ladyship's impending marriage.</font>

373
00:52:06,312 --> 00:52:10,902
<font size="71">Whenever I hear the voice
of my late father …</font>

374
00:53:40,406 --> 00:53:45,116
<font size="71">It's too early to rise.
Please sleep as long as you like.</font>

375
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:47,575
<font size="71">What am I doing here?</font>

376
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,088
<font size="71">What a thing to say …</font>

377
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:57,086
<font size="71">… as if you'd forgotten everything.</font>

378
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,680
<font size="71">Is my lord awake?</font>

379
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:14,896
<font size="71">Lead your husband by the hand
to the spring and bathe him.</font>

380
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:20,565
<font size="71">I won't intrude upon you any further.</font>

381
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:50,057
<font size="71">You have such a look of distrust
on your face.</font>

382
00:54:50,184 --> 00:54:55,024
<font size="71">You think I'm some kind
of enchantress, don't you?</font>

383
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:06,906
<font size="71">But you're mine,
you belong to me now.</font>

384
00:55:13,082 --> 00:55:19,262
<font size="71">From now on, you must devote
your entire life to me.</font>

385
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:57,671
<font size="71"><i>This love</i></font>

386
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:04,795
<font size="71"><i>This love of ours</i></font>

387
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:10,886
<font size="71"><i>Has driven me to madness …</i></font>

388
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,783
<font size="71">Even if you are a ghost or enchantress,</font>

389
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:26,823
<font size="71">I'll never let you go.</font>

390
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:35,004
<font size="71">I never imagined
such pleasures existed.</font>

391
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:47,011
<font size="71">This is exquisite! It's paradise!</font>

392
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:14,254
<font size="71">Help me! Help me!</font>

393
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:19,249
<font size="71">Somebody, please help!</font>

394
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:26,379
<font size="71">Someone, help me!</font>

395
00:57:36,768 --> 00:57:38,768
<font size="71">See any food?</font>

396
00:57:58,748 --> 00:58:00,708
<font size="71">Quickly, quickly!</font>

397
00:58:02,084 --> 00:58:06,134
<font size="71">Pull yourself together.
Come with me.</font>

398
00:58:20,686 --> 00:58:22,806
<font size="71">Come quickly!</font>

399
00:58:22,939 --> 00:58:29,199
<font size="71">- Take these rice cakes and this.
- I'll never forget your kindness.</font>

400
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,410
<font size="71">You'll be all right
if you take the back road.</font>

401
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:36,122
<font size="71">- To the left.
- Many thanks.</font>

402
00:58:36,244 --> 00:58:38,454
<font size="71">Be careful.</font>

403
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,922
<font size="71">Here!</font>

404
00:58:46,629 --> 00:58:49,009
<font size="71">It's mine!</font>

405
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:13,701
<font size="71">- Hey … you got any food?
- We're starving to death.</font>

406
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:28,746
<font size="71">That food's for my son.
Please don't take it!</font>

407
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,540
<font size="71">Do me the honour of beheading me.</font>

408
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:38,105
<font size="71">I've brought you a head! A head!
A general's head!</font>

409
01:02:38,235 --> 01:02:40,565
<font size="71">Please, my lord!</font>

410
01:02:40,696 --> 01:02:44,236
<font size="71">- What is it?
- Please look at this!</font>

411
01:02:51,123 --> 01:02:54,463
<font size="71">You found the head of a great general.</font>

412
01:02:54,585 --> 01:02:59,295
<font size="71">No, I didn't find it, my lord.
I killed him with my spear!</font>

413
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:04,095
<font size="71">Who'd believe a warrior
like Fuwa Katsuhige</font>

414
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,350
<font size="71">would let a mere foot soldier kill him?</font>

415
01:03:07,473 --> 01:03:11,353
<font size="71">A lucky find, but you'll be rewarded
all the same.</font>

416
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:14,647
<font size="71">What would you like?</font>

417
01:03:14,772 --> 01:03:18,442
<font size="71">A horse, armour and vassals.</font>

418
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:21,107
<font size="71">Very well. You shall have them.</font>

419
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:24,822
<font size="71">Thank you, my lord!</font>

420
01:03:24,949 --> 01:03:26,989
<font size="71">You're a clever one, aren't you?</font>

421
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,470
<font size="71">He looks like a fine samurai.
What clan does he belong to?</font>

422
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:54,229
<font size="71">- He killed Fuwa, the great general.
- What's his name?</font>

423
01:03:54,353 --> 01:03:57,863
<font size="71">Tobei of Nakanogo,
one of Lord Niwa's top men.</font>

424
01:03:57,982 --> 01:04:00,992
<font size="71">Pay homage,
that you may be so lucky.</font>

425
01:04:02,945 --> 01:04:07,945
<font size="71">Beautiful girls are waiting
for brave warriors!</font>

426
01:04:08,075 --> 01:04:13,365
<font size="71">We have the finest <i>sake</i> and fish!
Please come inside!</font>

427
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:16,752
<font size="71">I can't let you pass, sir!</font>

428
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:20,546
<font size="71">Come and look.
We have beautiful girls inside.</font>

429
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:24,221
<font size="71">- What's going on?
- Chief, perhaps we can rest here.</font>

430
01:04:24,341 --> 01:04:27,341
<font size="71">No, I'm heading directly home.</font>

431
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:31,019
<font size="71">I have someone waiting for me,
and she must see me in all my glory.</font>

432
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,140
<font size="71">Chief, why not let us
celebrate your triumph?</font>

433
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:39,148
<font size="71">- Your men are looking forward to it.
- I see. Very well.</font>

434
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:45,364
<font size="71">I, Nakanogo Tobei
of Lord Niwa's army, will rest here.</font>

435
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:49,617
<font size="71">- Prepare some tables.
- He'll rest here. Show your gratitude.</font>

436
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:51,872
<font size="71">Thank you, sir.</font>

437
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:04,298
<font size="71">Make way!</font>

438
01:05:05,591 --> 01:05:08,681
<font size="71">Clear the way for Master Tobei!</font>

439
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:26,275
<font size="71">Welcome.</font>

440
01:05:28,948 --> 01:05:32,158
<font size="71">- Which one is this Tobei?
- Him, over there.</font>

441
01:05:32,284 --> 01:05:34,204
<font size="71">Him?</font>

442
01:05:34,328 --> 01:05:37,038
<font size="71">I heard of his great exploits.</font>

443
01:05:43,254 --> 01:05:46,634
<font size="71">May I drink from your cup
so your luck rubs off on me?</font>

444
01:05:46,757 --> 01:05:48,297
<font size="71">Me, too!</font>

445
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:52,045
<font size="71">How did you manage
to kill such a great general?</font>

446
01:05:52,179 --> 01:05:56,059
<font size="71">Yes, tell us,
so we may do as you did!</font>

447
01:05:56,183 --> 01:05:58,523
<font size="71">A guide for future action!</font>

448
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:01,614
<font size="71">There's nothing much to tell.</font>

449
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,940
<font size="71">First, you need brains.
You need knowledge.</font>

450
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:09,067
<font size="71">Then, a strong arm.
Skill on the battlefield.</font>

451
01:06:09,196 --> 01:06:11,066
<font size="71">Martial artistry.</font>

452
01:06:11,198 --> 01:06:17,118
<font size="71">Speed to seize the moment.
The ability to see life in perspective.</font>

453
01:06:17,246 --> 01:06:21,996
<font size="71">Then you'll be wise as Kongming,
the great Chinese military strategist.</font>

454
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:25,296
<font size="71">But above all,
keep a clear, discerning mind.</font>

455
01:06:25,421 --> 01:06:28,261
<font size="71">- Got that?
- Indeed.</font>

456
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:32,142
<font size="71">For military tactics, study
the Kusunoki and Koshu schools.</font>

457
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:37,181
<font size="71">For firearms, Kanamaru school.
For the spear, Otsubo school.</font>

458
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:41,648
<font size="71">Next you need to know
fortifications and fortresses.</font>

459
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:47,400
<font size="71">Then defensive tactics,
V-formations and the like …</font>

460
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:59,501
<font size="71">Hey! My money!</font>

461
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:01,791
<font size="71">Let me go!</font>

462
01:07:04,918 --> 01:07:06,748
<font size="71">Crazy bitch!</font>

463
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:10,719
<font size="71">- Someone stop him!
- Hey, what's going on?</font>

464
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:15,511
<font size="71">- Let go of me!
- He's trying to run off like a thief!</font>

465
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:18,637
<font size="71">I don't give money
to wenches like you.</font>

466
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:25,018
<font size="71">Scoundrel!
Making a plaything of me.</font>

467
01:07:25,147 --> 01:07:27,817
<font size="71">This will do just fine, thanks!</font>

468
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:32,151
<font size="71">Ohama! Ohama!</font>

469
01:07:33,989 --> 01:07:36,409
<font size="71">So you're the big man now?</font>

470
01:07:37,493 --> 01:07:42,163
<font size="71">You've finally become the great samurai
of your dreams, eh?</font>

471
01:07:46,418 --> 01:07:51,508
<font size="71">While you've made your way to the top,
I've made quite a name for myself.</font>

472
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:57,182
<font size="71">In my fancy kimono and make-up,
drinking fine <i>sake,</i></font>

473
01:07:57,304 --> 01:08:00,314
<font size="71">I bed a different man every night.</font>

474
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:03,562
<font size="71">Some success for a woman, isn't it?</font>

475
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:13,528
<font size="71">Happy now?
This is what you wanted.</font>

476
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:17,994
<font size="71">Success always comes at a price,
and we pay in suffering.</font>

477
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:22,907
<font size="71">I may be a fallen woman,
but your success wipes the slate clean.</font>

478
01:08:23,956 --> 01:08:25,456
<font size="71">Come!</font>

479
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:29,422
<font size="71">Be my customer tonight
and we'll celebrate.</font>

480
01:08:29,545 --> 01:08:32,835
<font size="71">Buy this fallen woman with your money!</font>

481
01:08:37,052 --> 01:08:39,222
<font size="71">Ohama.</font>

482
01:08:39,346 --> 01:08:43,346
<font size="71">Without you,
my success means nothing.</font>

483
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:48,645
<font size="71">That's a lie! My fate meant nothing,
as long as you became a samurai.</font>

484
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:51,482
<font size="71">No, no, no, you're wrong.</font>

485
01:08:51,608 --> 01:08:53,438
<font size="71">Ohama!</font>

486
01:08:55,863 --> 01:09:00,283
<font size="71">I thought you'd be proud
if I made good.</font>

487
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:07,421
<font size="71">I never dreamed
you'd be brought to this.</font>

488
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:10,131
<font size="71">I'm a defiled woman.</font>

489
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,680
<font size="71">And you're to blame!</font>

490
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:21,471
<font size="71">- Can you restore my honour?
- I can.</font>

491
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:24,677
<font size="71">- Otherwise, I have to die!
- I can!</font>

492
01:09:24,808 --> 01:09:27,518
<font size="71">I swear I'll restore your honour.</font>

493
01:09:27,644 --> 01:09:30,404
<font size="71">How many times I've wanted to die,</font>

494
01:09:30,522 --> 01:09:33,862
<font size="71">but I had to see you first!</font>

495
01:09:33,984 --> 01:09:38,784
<font size="71">I hated myself for it, I hated myself,</font>

496
01:09:38,906 --> 01:09:41,526
<font size="71">but I couldn't die
without seeing you first!</font>

497
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:44,998
<font size="71">I couldn't die … I couldn't die!</font>

498
01:10:05,933 --> 01:10:07,563
<font size="71">This …</font>

499
01:10:09,811 --> 01:10:12,481
<font size="71">… and this. Thank you.</font>

500
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:16,236
<font size="71">I don't quite have enough.
Could you lower the price?</font>

501
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:21,241
<font size="71">In that case, I'll take this back.</font>

502
01:10:21,365 --> 01:10:23,195
<font size="71">I really wanted that.</font>

503
01:10:23,325 --> 01:10:27,535
<font size="71">Come to Kutsuki Manor
and I'll pay you the rest.</font>

504
01:10:27,663 --> 01:10:31,883
<font size="71">- Kutsuki Manor?
- Yes, at the foot of the mountain.</font>

505
01:10:36,213 --> 01:10:38,303
<font size="71">Take it all,</font>

506
01:10:38,423 --> 01:10:40,303
<font size="71">and go away!</font>

507
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:44,928
<font size="71">Keep your money, too. Just go away!</font>

508
01:10:55,274 --> 01:10:58,904
<font size="71">- Wait.
- How can I help you, Priest?</font>

509
01:10:59,027 --> 01:11:02,197
<font size="71">I sense something evil … an ill omen.</font>

510
01:11:02,322 --> 01:11:06,452
<font size="71">- What is it?
- Let me look closely at your face.</font>

511
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:09,077
<font size="71">- My face?
- Yes.</font>

512
01:11:09,204 --> 01:11:12,714
<font size="71">We can't talk here.
Please follow me.</font>

513
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,633
<font size="71">Very well …</font>

514
01:11:23,343 --> 01:11:27,353
<font size="71">The shadow of death
is upon your face.</font>

515
01:11:29,308 --> 01:11:34,018
<font size="71">Has some strange apparition
crossed your path, perhaps?</font>

516
01:11:34,146 --> 01:11:36,606
<font size="71">No, not at all.</font>

517
01:11:36,732 --> 01:11:41,652
<font size="71">Have you no home, no family?</font>

518
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,700
<font size="71">If others depend on you,
you must return to them at once.</font>

519
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:55,669
<font size="71">If you remain here any longer,
you will forfeit your life.</font>

520
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:57,542
<font size="71">Return home quickly.</font>

521
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:59,499
<font size="71">But why?</font>

522
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:03,300
<font size="71">Do not ask the reason.
Your life is at stake.</font>

523
01:12:04,968 --> 01:12:10,218
<font size="71">But I spend my days happily
with Lady Wakasa at Kutsuki Manor.</font>

524
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:13,349
<font size="71">- She is a spirit of the dead.
- What nonsense.</font>

525
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:19,154
<font size="71">This love of yours is forbidden.</font>

526
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,780
<font size="71">Do you not love your wife and child?</font>

527
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:27,905
<font size="71">Would you forsake your life
and abandon them, too?</font>

528
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:32,582
<font size="71">Wait!</font>

529
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,630
<font size="71">Go then, if you must,</font>

530
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:45,513
<font size="71">but I cannot let you walk
into the jaws of death.</font>

531
01:12:45,634 --> 01:12:48,264
<font size="71">I will exorcise this ghost.</font>

532
01:12:49,388 --> 01:12:51,388
<font size="71">Come.</font>

533
01:12:51,515 --> 01:12:57,225
<font size="71">When you realise
how terrifying this spirit is,</font>

534
01:12:57,354 --> 01:12:59,694
<font size="71">you'll come to your senses.</font>

535
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:33,006
<font size="71">Oh … how beautiful!</font>

536
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:42,855
<font size="71">Such lovely jewellery!</font>

537
01:13:51,491 --> 01:13:53,581
<font size="71">You've made me so happy!</font>

538
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:58,075
<font size="71">How thoughtful of you, sir.</font>

539
01:13:58,206 --> 01:14:01,076
<font size="71">I'm so relieved.</font>

540
01:14:01,209 --> 01:14:06,669
<font size="71">You were so late in returning
that I grew terribly worried.</font>

541
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,470
<font size="71">But you look troubled, my dear.</font>

542
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:16,217
<font size="71">What has happened?</font>

543
01:14:18,977 --> 01:14:20,977
<font size="71">What is it?</font>

544
01:14:25,025 --> 01:14:29,025
<font size="71">You must not leave here again.</font>

545
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:33,204
<font size="71">Since the fall of our clan,</font>

546
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:36,825
<font size="71">people have treated us
with nothing but contempt</font>

547
01:14:36,953 --> 01:14:40,673
<font size="71">and slander our name.</font>

548
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:43,881
<font size="71">What a wretched world!</font>

549
01:14:44,002 --> 01:14:46,302
<font size="71">Genjuro,</font>

550
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:51,431
<font size="71">I want you never
to leave my side again.</font>

551
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:56,471
<font size="71">Let's leave this manor
and return to my native province.</font>

552
01:15:00,227 --> 01:15:06,017
<font size="71">Genjuro,
you are my husband for life.</font>

553
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:08,939
<font size="71">You will accompany me, won't you?</font>

554
01:15:09,986 --> 01:15:12,446
<font size="71">Please forgive me.</font>

555
01:15:13,782 --> 01:15:15,622
<font size="71">I've been …</font>

556
01:15:18,411 --> 01:15:22,081
<font size="71">I've been lying to you.</font>

557
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:27,749
<font size="71">I have a wife and child.</font>

558
01:15:27,879 --> 01:15:33,129
<font size="71">I left them back home
in the chaos of the war.</font>

559
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:36,560
<font size="71">You must leave all that behind you now.</font>

560
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,270
<font size="71">Please let me go!</font>

561
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,390
<font size="71">No!</font>

562
01:15:40,517 --> 01:15:43,137
<font size="71">I refuse to let you go.</font>

563
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:56,365
<font size="71">So, you will come with me
to my native province …</font>

564
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:01,907
<font size="71">… immediately.</font>

565
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:05,381
<font size="71">What is it, my lady?</font>

566
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,800
<font size="71">- He has something on his skin!
- His skin?</font>

567
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:12,921
<font size="71">Genjuro, did you …?</font>

568
01:16:14,384 --> 01:16:17,894
<font size="71">- Did you …?
- On your skin?</font>

569
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:23,311
<font size="71">You must wash away
what's on your skin!</font>

570
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:35,199
<font size="71">Why did you wed her
if you were already married?</font>

571
01:16:35,322 --> 01:16:40,292
<font size="71">I don't know … How could I have
made such a terrible mistake?</font>

572
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:44,370
<font size="71">A mistake for a man perhaps,
but for a woman, it's far worse.</font>

573
01:16:44,497 --> 01:16:47,127
<font size="71">Please forgive me.
Let me go.</font>

574
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,090
<font size="71">Certainly not!</font>

575
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:57,257
<font size="71">Wipe off those Sanskrit prayers
to the Buddha and that curse,</font>

576
01:16:57,385 --> 01:17:00,005
<font size="71">or we will never forgive you!</font>

577
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,270
<font size="71">Genjuro,</font>

578
01:17:04,392 --> 01:17:11,782
<font size="71">how could you even think
of doing something so dreadful?</font>

579
01:17:13,735 --> 01:17:20,735
<font size="71">All I wish is to remain
forever by your side.</font>

580
01:17:22,786 --> 01:17:24,786
<font size="71">For all eternity.</font>

581
01:17:27,082 --> 01:17:29,792
<font size="71">Lady Wakasa departed this world</font>

582
01:17:29,918 --> 01:17:35,508
<font size="71">without ever having known love
in her life.</font>

583
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:39,972
<font size="71">It grieved my heart
to see her so sorrowful.</font>

584
01:17:40,095 --> 01:17:46,885
<font size="71">I wanted her ladyship to enjoy fully
the pleasures of a woman's life,</font>

585
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:51,478
<font size="71">so I chose to return with her,</font>

586
01:17:51,606 --> 01:17:56,356
<font size="71">to wander this world.</font>

587
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,860
<font size="71">Our hopes were fulfilled</font>

588
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:03,620
<font size="71">when she met a good man like you</font>

589
01:18:04,786 --> 01:18:09,866
<font size="71">and found a love that occurs
only once a lifetime.</font>

590
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,210
<font size="71">And now, when she has
at last found joy,</font>

591
01:18:15,338 --> 01:18:18,168
<font size="71">you speak of returning home,</font>

592
01:18:18,299 --> 01:18:22,969
<font size="71">never to see each other again.</font>

593
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:26,096
<font size="71">Does it not pain you to know</font>

594
01:18:26,224 --> 01:18:32,944
<font size="71">that you may ruin her ladyship's
only chance of happiness?</font>

595
01:18:33,064 --> 01:18:36,484
<font size="71">Do you feel no remorse?</font>

596
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:43,829
<font size="71">Master Genjuro, you must banish
these dreadful thoughts</font>

597
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:49,210
<font size="71">and stay by her side forever …</font>

598
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:53,000
<font size="71">Please forgive me! Forgive me!</font>

599
01:18:54,753 --> 01:18:56,423
<font size="71">Genjuro!</font>

600
01:18:57,756 --> 01:18:59,836
<font size="71">Genjuro!</font>

601
01:20:00,235 --> 01:20:02,065
<font size="71">This is the man!</font>

602
01:20:02,195 --> 01:20:04,235
<font size="71">Hey, you! Get up!</font>

603
01:20:06,574 --> 01:20:10,874
<font size="71">- What are you doing?
- You shameless thief!</font>

604
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:13,995
<font size="71">You stole a sacred treasure
from the shrine.</font>

605
01:20:14,124 --> 01:20:18,554
<font size="71">- You're wrong! I didn't steal it.
- Silence!</font>

606
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:21,170
<font size="71">This sacred sword
disappeared a month ago.</font>

607
01:20:21,297 --> 01:20:25,137
<font size="71">That can't be! It belongs
to Lady Wakasa at Kutsuki Manor.</font>

608
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,050
<font size="71">- Kutsuki Manor, you say?
- That's right!</font>

609
01:20:29,722 --> 01:20:31,642
<font size="71">You must've been dreaming.</font>

610
01:20:31,766 --> 01:20:34,556
<font size="71">This is where it stood
before the clan was wiped out.</font>

611
01:20:34,686 --> 01:20:36,686
<font size="71">He's lying through his teeth!</font>

612
01:20:36,813 --> 01:20:40,023
<font size="71">Where in the manor
did you find the sword?</font>

613
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:42,490
<font size="71">He's suspicious. Search him.</font>

614
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:48,827
<font size="71">That's my money!
Give it back!</font>

615
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:52,950
<font size="71">Silence! In peace time,
we'd throw you in jail,</font>

616
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:55,369
<font size="71">but Shibata's army burned it down.</font>

617
01:20:55,498 --> 01:20:58,378
<font size="71">Be thankful for that, you lucky bastard.</font>

618
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:34,947
<font size="71"><i>The finest silk</i></font>

619
01:21:36,414 --> 01:21:44,844
<font size="71"><i>Of choicest hue</i></font>

620
01:21:47,634 --> 01:21:54,434
<font size="71"><i>May change and fade a way</i></font>

621
01:21:54,557 --> 01:22:01,307
<font size="71"><i>As would my life</i></font>

622
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,529
<font size="71"><i>My beloved …</i></font>

623
01:23:13,219 --> 01:23:14,719
<font size="71">Miyagi.</font>

624
01:23:16,597 --> 01:23:18,177
<font size="71">Miyagi!</font>

625
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:47,838
<font size="71">- I'm sorry I was gone so long.
- You're back!</font>

626
01:23:47,962 --> 01:23:54,342
<font size="71">I knew you'd be worried about me.
But you're all right …</font>

627
01:23:54,469 --> 01:23:57,139
<font size="71">I'm so happy to see you're all right.</font>

628
01:23:59,057 --> 01:24:02,057
<font size="71">- Genichi?
- He's asleep.</font>

629
01:24:02,185 --> 01:24:05,395
<font size="71">Let me hold him, let me hold him.</font>

630
01:24:09,901 --> 01:24:11,401
<font size="71">Genichi …</font>

631
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:15,067
<font size="71">Genichi, I'm back! I'm back!</font>

632
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:21,448
<font size="71">Your father's returned.
Let me hold you, let me hold you …</font>

633
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:32,045
<font size="71">I wanted to bring you back
fine presents, but this is all I have.</font>

634
01:24:33,299 --> 01:24:36,969
<font size="71">I … I made a terrible mistake!</font>

635
01:24:37,095 --> 01:24:42,225
<font size="71">Don't say another word, my dear.
You've returned safely to us.</font>

636
01:24:46,062 --> 01:24:51,982
<font size="71">I realise now how right you were.
My mind was warped.</font>

637
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:54,530
<font size="71">Let's not speak of it anymore.</font>

638
01:24:56,155 --> 01:24:58,735
<font size="71">You must be exhausted.</font>

639
01:24:58,866 --> 01:25:01,656
<font size="71">I have some <i>sake</i> prepared.</font>

640
01:25:19,011 --> 01:25:21,971
<font size="71">And there's a stew ready in the pot.</font>

641
01:26:09,145 --> 01:26:12,435
<font size="71">I feel so relieved.</font>

642
01:26:14,984 --> 01:26:17,614
<font size="71"><i>Sake</i> never tasted so good.</font>

643
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:25,369
<font size="71">It's so peaceful here.</font>

644
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:34,589
<font size="71">Come, Genichi.
I'll put you to bed.</font>

645
01:26:40,218 --> 01:26:46,218
<font size="71">I haven't had a moment's peace
since I left here,</font>

646
01:26:46,349 --> 01:26:51,439
<font size="71">but I'm home at last …
home at last …</font>

647
01:26:51,562 --> 01:26:57,442
<font size="71">Home at last … home at last …</font>

648
01:30:26,485 --> 01:30:30,905
<font size="71">Is someone in there?
Open the door!</font>

649
01:30:32,324 --> 01:30:35,124
<font size="71">Is someone in there?
Open up.</font>

650
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:45,251
<font size="71">- Village chief!
- Genjuro! You're back?</font>

651
01:30:45,379 --> 01:30:49,549
<font size="71">Yes. Thank you for all
your kindness in my absence.</font>

652
01:30:52,428 --> 01:30:54,848
<font size="71">Oh, there you are, my boy!</font>

653
01:30:54,972 --> 01:30:57,892
<font size="71">I was worried,
I didn't know where you'd gone.</font>

654
01:30:58,017 --> 01:30:59,727
<font size="71">What a relief.</font>

655
01:31:02,688 --> 01:31:04,898
<font size="71">What a relief.</font>

656
01:31:05,024 --> 01:31:08,534
<font size="71">The boy must have heard
you were back.</font>

657
01:31:08,652 --> 01:31:10,742
<font size="71">Hey, Miyagi …</font>

658
01:31:10,863 --> 01:31:12,363
<font size="71">Miyagi!</font>

659
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:16,450
<font size="71">Genjuro …</font>

660
01:31:16,577 --> 01:31:18,997
<font size="71">Are you dreaming?</font>

661
01:31:19,121 --> 01:31:21,081
<font size="71">Dreaming?</font>

662
01:31:21,207 --> 01:31:25,247
<font size="71">Miyagi was killed by soldiers
of the defeated army.</font>

663
01:31:26,629 --> 01:31:28,299
<font size="71">Killed?</font>

664
01:31:31,842 --> 01:31:36,682
<font size="71">She'd have been so happy
to see you back safely.</font>

665
01:31:38,474 --> 01:31:39,984
<font size="71">Poor thing.</font>

666
01:31:42,728 --> 01:31:44,978
<font size="71">Merciful Buddha …</font>

667
01:31:50,569 --> 01:31:53,279
<font size="71">Ever since Miyagi died,</font>

668
01:31:53,405 --> 01:31:56,485
<font size="71">I've been looking after your boy
in my house.</font>

669
01:31:56,617 --> 01:32:00,617
<font size="71">I was so afraid when he suddenly
disappeared last night.</font>

670
01:32:03,582 --> 01:32:06,672
<font size="71">The bond between parent and child
is strong.</font>

671
01:32:06,794 --> 01:32:11,174
<font size="71">But how could he have known
that you'd returned?</font>

672
01:32:28,983 --> 01:32:32,243
<font size="71">To hell with this … and this …</font>

673
01:32:35,155 --> 01:32:36,775
<font size="71">… and this!</font>

674
01:32:38,409 --> 01:32:44,209
<font size="71">I told you so, but you were too stupid
to learn except through misfortune.</font>

675
01:32:44,331 --> 01:32:48,251
<font size="71">The war drove us mad with ambition.</font>

676
01:32:49,587 --> 01:32:52,797
<font size="71">Don't let my suffering be in vain.</font>

677
01:32:52,923 --> 01:32:56,053
<font size="71">Pull yourself together and work hard.</font>

678
01:33:17,114 --> 01:33:19,074
<font size="71">Why did you have to die?</font>

679
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:24,158
<font size="71">Miyagi, why did you have to die?</font>

680
01:33:42,514 --> 01:33:45,524
<font size="71"><i>I did not die.</i></font>

681
01:33:45,643 --> 01:33:48,563
<font size="71"><i>I am at your side.</i></font>

682
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:53,570
<font size="71"><i>Your delusion has come to an end.</i></font>

683
01:33:55,152 --> 01:34:00,572
<font size="71"><i>You are again your true self,</i>

684
01:34:01,867 --> 01:34:04,947
<font size="71"><i>Your work is waiting …</i></font>

685
01:34:16,966 --> 01:34:20,796
<font size="71"><i>What a beautiful shape!</i></font>

686
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:29,440
<font size="71"><i>Helping you spin the wheel</i>
<i>is my greatest pleasure.</i></font>

687
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:34,111
<font size="71"><i>How I long to see it</i>
<i>when it's fired.</i></font>

688
01:34:36,068 --> 01:34:38,068
<font size="71"><i>The firewood is cut and ready.</i></font>

689
01:34:39,196 --> 01:34:42,616
<font size="71"><i>The rampaging soldiers are gone.</i></font>

690
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:47,331
<font size="71"><i>So make your wonderful pottery</i>
<i>in peace.</i></font>

691
01:34:52,876 --> 01:34:55,876
<font size="71"><i>So many things have happened.</i></font>

692
01:34:58,757 --> 01:35:04,507
<font size="71"><i>You've finally become</i>

693
01:35:04,638 --> 01:35:06,848
<font size="71"><i>But, alas …</i></font>

694
01:35:08,976 --> 01:35:13,476
<font size="71"><i>… I am no longer among the living.</i></font>

695
01:35:15,566 --> 01:35:19,236
<font size="71"><i>Such is the way of the world.</i></font>

696
01:35:40,549 --> 01:35:43,469
<font size="71">You must be tired. Rest a while.</font>

697
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:55,862
<font size="71">Here, Genichi. It's delicious.</font>

698
01:35:55,981 --> 01:35:58,481
<font size="71">Eat it while it's hot.</font>

699
01:35:58,609 --> 01:36:01,149
<font size="71">Brother, eat before it gets cold.</font>

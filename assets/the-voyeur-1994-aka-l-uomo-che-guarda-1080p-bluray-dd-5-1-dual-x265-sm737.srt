1
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,142
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Aunt Clare? It's Edoardo.
- Dodo, how are you?</font>

2
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,395
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Fine. Is Sylvia there?
- No. She's out.</font>

3
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,648
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ah well, it doesn't matter.</font>

4
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,274
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Shall I have her call you?</font>

5
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, just tell her I'll be
expecting her for dinner.</font>

6
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:24,228
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">THE VOYEUR</font>

7
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,110
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Were you daydreaming?</font>

8
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,875
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was remembering
back before you left me.</font>

9
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,780
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know I didn't leave you.</font>

10
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,534
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sorry, I couldn't be here earlier.</font>

11
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Men?
- Hardly... Just busy.</font>

12
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,165
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Have you ordered yet?</font>

13
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, what will you have?</font>

14
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,294
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The usual:</font>

15
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,297
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">chicken with almond and fried rice.</font>

16
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,257
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">For two.</font>

17
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,343
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Anyway, thanks for coming.</font>

18
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,720
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, I'm still your wife.
Am I not?</font>

19
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,972
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then you could come home.</font>

20
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,350
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Lay off, Dodo.</font>

21
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,606
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I've already told you
it just isn't possible for now.</font>

22
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,484
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If I insisted to see you,
it's because I have some news.</font>

23
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,236
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Oh, yeah? What?
- I've got a house to offer you.</font>

24
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,406
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- And it'll be all ours.
- Oh, really? What house?</font>

25
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,409
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The apartment
above my father's.</font>

26
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,872
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I've decided to ask him for it
as an advance on my inheritance.</font>

27
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What brought this all on?</font>

28
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,378
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I'm doing it for you.
- For me? How do you mean?</font>

29
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So that we can live
without my father.</font>

30
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:16,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's he got to do with it?</font>

31
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,470
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I know you can't stand him.</font>

32
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,098
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're wrong,
he's fascinated me ever since</font>

33
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,225
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I took his classes
at the university.</font>

34
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,979
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If anything, you're the one
who can't stand him.</font>

35
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,148
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tell me why you left then!.</font>

36
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,026
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why do you always make me
repeat myself?</font>

37
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I needed some time alone
to think things over</font>

38
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and understand
what's happening to me.</font>

39
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,202
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't insist, please.</font>

40
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,214
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If there's someone else,
just tell me!</font>

41
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,970
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It wasn't the house.</font>

42
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,932
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's okay, sir.
You need something?</font>

43
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,853
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry.</font>

44
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,573
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Even if it wasn't the house,</font>

45
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,784
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll still ask
for the apartment.</font>

46
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,620
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Even though
I didn't run away,</font>

47
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,498
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">do whatever you think is right.</font>

48
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,512
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's make love, Dodo,
here, right now.</font>

49
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,056
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do you mean? How?</font>

50
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:30,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">With our eyes,
like the first time.</font>

51
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,109
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Watch me.</font>

52
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,579
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Do you like it?
- Drives me crazy.</font>

53
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,083
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Looks like the hackles
of a wild cat.</font>

54
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,545
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What else?
What else does it make you think of?</font>

55
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,088
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The crest of a rooster.</font>

56
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,590
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">More, Dodo,
say something else!.</font>

57
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,636
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A plume of a helmet.
A brush.</font>

58
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:08,139
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- A living den.
- Oh yeah, a living den.</font>

59
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,935
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Go ahead, touch it.
- I'd rather watch.</font>

60
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,306
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I've got to go.
- Shall I go with you?</font>

61
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,099
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Morning, Fausta.
Is my father up yet?</font>

62
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,185
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You bet.</font>

63
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,978
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's "you bet" mean?</font>

64
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,023
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- That's for me to know.
- Explain yourself.</font>

65
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:44,486
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Too complicated.
Don't bother.</font>

66
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,197
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What've you got
against Dad this morning?</font>

67
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,994
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can take him
his breakfast today.</font>

68
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,838
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">When I stick
the needle in his ass,</font>

69
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,883
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you can stay
and see for yourself.</font>

70
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,176
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">See what?</font>

71
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,728
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where he tries
to touch me,</font>

72
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,564
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the way he wants me
to touch him,</font>

73
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,275
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the things
he'd like me to do.</font>

74
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:28,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- And?
- Don't you get it?</font>

75
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,746
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, I don't.</font>

76
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,670
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He does everything
to make sure I touch him...</font>

77
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,006
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you know where.
Now do you get it?</font>

78
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- So that's the way it is, eh?
- Yeah, it's like that.</font>

79
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,929
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can't you stop him?</font>

80
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,056
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I tried to, but he ignores it.</font>

81
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,308
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you want to quit,</font>

82
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,853
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">someone else
can take care of him.</font>

83
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,855
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No no, I don't want to leave.</font>

84
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,149
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I just wanted you to know.</font>

85
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:10,030
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Why?
- Just so that you would know.</font>

86
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,534
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Okay, we'll discuss this again</font>

87
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,578
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">some other time.</font>

88
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,538
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Look out.
I'm holding the needle.</font>

89
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,754
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Promise me
you won't tell your father.</font>

90
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,464
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">As you wish.</font>

91
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He is a great man.</font>

92
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,260
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I wouldn't like to see him hurt.</font>

93
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,345
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's just a bit stubborn.</font>

94
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,682
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Maybe from
his point of view he's right</font>

95
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,893
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and if it'll make him happy, I'll...</font>

96
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,645
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- You're very charitable.
- Hell no, I'm not.</font>

97
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,815
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Your father pays me
three times the going rate.</font>

98
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,692
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You must have
that magic touch.</font>

99
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh yeah, it's my fairy fingers</font>

100
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,656
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but I don't feel
anything for him.</font>

101
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,659
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Not that he cares
about me either.</font>

102
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:00,622
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's just got
a one-track mind, that's al!</font>

103
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,166
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">All right.
I won't say a word.</font>

104
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,343
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And remember, don't leave
till I come in with the shot.</font>

105
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,058
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come in!</font>

106
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He got it.</font>

107
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Who?
- The cat.</font>

108
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,529
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's been stalking that sparrow
for the last ten minutes.</font>

109
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,322
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's dedication.</font>

110
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,407
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And whose side were you on?</font>

111
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,119
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The bird's, son, of course.</font>

112
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,249
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- You're looking good.
- Oh yes, as fit as a fiddle.</font>

113
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,502
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They might try
to stand me on my feet today.</font>

114
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,090
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Pass me the yogurt, would you?</font>

115
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,717
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That way I'll be ready
for the shot.</font>

116
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,353
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How are things
with Silvia?</font>

117
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,857
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Pretty well, I think.</font>

118
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,943
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I saw her yesterday.
We talked about you too.</font>

119
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">About me?
That's nice. A propos of what?</font>

120
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The apartment upstairs.</font>

121
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,661
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I told her I'd ask you for it as
and advance on my inheritance.</font>

122
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,622
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- And?
- She seemed to agree.</font>

123
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,416
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm glad to hear that.</font>

124
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,711
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I never really understood
why she left.</font>

125
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Neither did I.</font>

126
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,175
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Maybe because of the house.</font>

127
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The house?</font>

128
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,928
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm convinced she wanted
a place of her own...</font>

129
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,598
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">our own. It has
nothing to do with you.</font>

130
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,101
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a perfectly legitimate
and very feminine desire.</font>

131
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,980
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tell her the apartment
is yours, both of yours!</font>

132
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,567
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Thank you, dad.
- Anyway, they're moving</font>

00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,777
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the notary's office
now that he's dead.</font>

134
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,487
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'll have to do
some work on it.</font>

135
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,867
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Knock-knock.</font>

136
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,933
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Aren't you going
to the university?</font>

137
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,018
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have a class later.</font>

138
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,399
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Would you like him
to leave?</font>

139
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,986
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why? He's my son,
not some stranger.</font>

140
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,459
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't hurt me.</font>

141
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,587
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Take it easy,</font>

142
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that's sweet meat.</font>

143
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,093
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Your hand sure doesn't hurt,
does it, Professor?</font>

144
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,366
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come on, turn over.</font>

145
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,980
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's for you.
Someone named Patrizia.</font>

146
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,815
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, right.
Give it to me.</font>

147
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,577
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They might get me up today.</font>

148
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,121
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, all right.
Almost up then.</font>

149
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Fausta's here, the nurse.</font>

150
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,084
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And my son too.</font>

151
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:23,843
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't worry.</font>

152
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,846
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Want to bet?</font>

153
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,184
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll prove it
when you come.</font>

154
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,820
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll swear on my life.</font>

155
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,850
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Morning, countess.
- Morning.</font>

156
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,437
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The elevator's out of order
again. It's a disgrace.</font>

157
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It never seems
to be working.</font>

158
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,858
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If it hadn't been
out of order that day,</font>

159
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,023
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">your father would never
have had that terrible fall.</font>

160
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,904
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">By the way, how is he?</font>

161
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Very well, thank you.
- He's an extraordinary man.</font>

162
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,285
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They don't make them
like that anymore.</font>

163
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,454
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sorry,
but I'm a bit late.</font>

164
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,916
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Give him my best, don't forget.
- Goodbye and thank you again.</font>

165
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,843
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But the voyeuristic scene
par excellence</font>

166
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,719
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">is the one
described by Herodotus</font>

167
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:52,140
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and later echoed by Gide
in "Le roi Candaule." While undressing,</font>

168
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,600
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the queen is being spied
on by the king's favorite,</font>

169
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,728
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">who is also spied on
by the king himself.</font>

170
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,440
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What we have is a two-fold</font>

171

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">form of voyeurism</font>

172
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,821
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">or a carambole of scopophilia
if you prefer.</font>

173
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,865
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Doesn't "voyeur"
just mean "peeping Tom"?</font>

174
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,910
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It means
"the man who watches."</font>

175
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,497
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What does scopophilia mean?
"Desire to screw"?</font>

176
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,169
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It means
"the pleasure of watching."</font>

177
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:24,338
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I could go on
and give you many other examples</font>

178
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,842
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">to back up
my conviction that voyeurism</font>

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">or, if you prefer, scopophilia</font>

180
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,473
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">is a vital element in literature
and narrative</font>

181
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,057
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">just as... but that goes without saying...</font>

182
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,269
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">it is in cinema and photography.</font>

183
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,692
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So not only does
the artist</font>

184
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,572
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">turn us into spectators</font>

185
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">of a secret,</font>

186

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">intimate,
hidden and forbidden act,</font>

into his accomplices</font>

188
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,210

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">quest for knowledge.</font>

190
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,577
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The quest, that is,
to express</font>

191
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,413
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">what society normally
represses,</font>

192
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,332
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">by focusing in areas that,</font>

193
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,043
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">due to hypocrisy,
fear and ignorance,</font>

194
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,503

195
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:49,507
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and that yet constitute
a vital part of the real life.</font>

196
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,968
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That is to say sex
in its most extreme,</font>

197
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">helpless and naked form.</font>

198
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,347
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">In all its essential,</font>

199
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,432
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">carnal and bodily essence.</font>

200
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,518
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">As it is clearly illustrated</font>

201
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,844
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">in Mallarmé's poem, "Une negresse
par le démon secouée,"</font>

202
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,898
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that I'd like you all
to think about.</font>

203
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,067
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can someone
give these out?</font>

204
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,254
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We'll continue tomorrow.
Read the papers.</font>

205
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,548
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a "hard" poem.</font>

206
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,296
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can you give me a ride?</font>

207
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,423
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Where are you going?
- Home.</font>

208
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,469
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So?</font>

209
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,888
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sure. Come in.</font>

210
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,896
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, I almost sat on it.</font>

211
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,398
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't worry.
You're too soft.</font>

212
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,988
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where do you live?</font>

213
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Lungotevere della Vittoria.</font>

214
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,542
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That was a good class.</font>

215
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,379
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At least you liked it.
I'm afraid the others didn't.</font>

216
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,132
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why have I never seen you?</font>

217
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,844
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I go to the university now and then,
more out of curiosity.</font>

218
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,515
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Curiosity about what?
- The teachers!</font>

219
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,688
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Where are you from?
- Africa.</font>

220
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:12,566
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I would have said Sweden.
Africa's a big place.</font>

221
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,652
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Guess.</font>

222
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,739
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Senegal?
- No.</font>

223
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,575
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Mali?
- Not Mali either.</font>

224
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,577
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Congo?
- Very good, Professor,</font>

225
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,705
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">except it's called Zaire now.</font>

226
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,834
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My name's Edoardo, not Professor.
Dodo to my friends.</font>

227
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,878
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Dodo, how funny.</font>

228
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,004
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you?</font>

229
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,840
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Pascasie.</font>

230
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,846
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I gathered from your lesson
that you like to watch.</font>

231
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,474
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">To be honest,
during the lecture</font>

232
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,810
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I felt I was the one
being spied on.</font>

233
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,816
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's so special
about this poem?</font>

234
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,986
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a perfect example
of literary scopophilia.</font>

235
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Mallarmé's intentions
are profanatory</font>

236
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,837
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the negress and child
are doing a 69.</font>

237
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,298
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know what that is?</font>

238
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,468
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Of course. Giving oral sex
to each other.</font>

239
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,073
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's nothing scandalous
about that.</font>

240
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,263
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But it is, and triply so.</font>

241
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,640
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a 69
between two women...</font>

242
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,768
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">one adult, the other a child.</font>

243
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,520
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">One is black
and the other white.</font>

244
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,164
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's the subversive quest.</font>

245
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,334
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Mallarmé has us observe
not only a thing intimate</font>

246
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,920
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and private, but also privacy
within privacy...</font>

247
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the "pale and pink seashell."</font>

248
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,055
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you only watch
or do you do it too?</font>

249
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:15,356
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- What a mess.
- What shall we do?</font>

250
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There isn't much you can do.</font>

251
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,945
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Just sit back and watch.
- Well, thanks anyway.</font>

252
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,489
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can walk from here.
I live just after the bridge.</font>

253
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hang on.
Maybe there's something I still can do,</font>

254
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,786
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">like cross that bridge,
for example.</font>

255
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,046
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There.
That's where I live.</font>

256
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,882
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So it's goodbye then.</font>

257
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do you need
this one for?</font>

258
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,430
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">To capture things
that catch my eye.</font>

259
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,142
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Would you like
to capture me?</font>

260
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,186
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah, sure, of course.</font>

261
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,897
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Not here.</font>

262
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,066
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At my place.</font>

263
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Hi, Gesuina.

- My boyfriend.</font>

443
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,018

to the magazine.</font>

444

Very artistic, aren't they?</font>

445
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:27,316

00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I need to go.</font>

525
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:23,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My compliments, again.</font>

526
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:25,688
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Right. Tell Silvia
to quit being so grouchy with me.</font>

527
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:28,315
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She has a whole place
for herself now!</font>

528
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,403
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Know what I say?</font>

529
00:59:32,528 --> 00:59:36,240
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tomorrow we'll bring you
the crutches.</font>

530
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:40,286
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- You won't believe the relief.
- I bet I'll be flying.</font>

531
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,296
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We'd better clear things up
once and for all?</font>

532
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The apartment isn't</font>

533
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,800
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the only reason why
I'm not coming back to you.</font>

534
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,344
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's another one.</font>

535
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,555
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What?</font>

536
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,769
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is there another man?</font>

537
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,814
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes... if you like,</font>

538
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,275
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">there's another man.</font>

539
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,239
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

540
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,742
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hey, what movie
are you watching here?</font>

541
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,415
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I tried to get through to you,</font>

542
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,877
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but you were so involved
with the apartment...</font>

543
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,756
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Besides,
I was ashamed.</font>

544
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,592
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">To tell me about it
or to do it?</font>

545
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:40,888
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This man... I don't love him.</font>

546
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,225
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So why are you with him?</font>

547
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,566
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can't see any point
in us seeing each other.</font>

548
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,902
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, please.
Don't go.</font>

549
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I need you.</font>

550
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,078
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I doubt that.</font>

551
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:07,748
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But I do. Oh, Dodo.</font>

552
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,625
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If I know you're there
and if we go on</font>

553
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,335
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">seeing each other,</font>

554
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,504
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm sure I'll be able
to leave him.</font>

555
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,506
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But what's stopping you?</font>

556
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:18,300
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know. it's beyond me.</font>

557
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,845
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I do all I can
to stop seeing him</font>

558
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,139
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and then I give in again.</font>

559
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,475
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And that's not love?</font>

560
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,395
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, I don't know what it is,</font>

561
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,439
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but I do know I don't love him.
I love you, Dodo.</font>

562
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:36,902
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't feel anything
for him,</font>

563
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,780
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">just a heavy sexual
attraction.</font>

564
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,284
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So what am I supposed to do?</font>

565
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,162
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hang up his clothes
while you two are humping?</font>

566
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:56,505
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can you tell me what's so
irresistible about this man?</font>

567
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,384
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Like fuck!</font>

568
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tell me who he is,
what the fuck he does,</font>

569
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,679
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">how long it's been going on,
everything!</font>

570
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:07,850
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hey, shut up over there,
there are other people here!</font>

571
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,019
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- You want details?
- Yeah, details.</font>

572
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:15,065
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I like the way he takes me.
- The way he takes you?</font>

573
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,359
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">From behind.</font>

574
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,488
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He bends me over
on the table and he fucks me</font>

575
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:22,865
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I can make
all the grimaces I want</font>

576
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,700
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">because he can't see my face</font>

577
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:27,119
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I can't see his.</font>

578
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,413
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can think of who I want.
He could be someone else,</font>

579
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:33,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">someone I don't even know,
even an animal.</font>

580
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:36,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ls that enough?</font>

581
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:40,424
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh God, Dodo, why do you want
to know everything?</font>

582
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:49,600
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want you to betray him
with me, at least in words.</font>

583
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:01,153
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">When we do it,
he grabs my hair</font>

584
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,446
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">from behind and he says,</font>

585
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:05,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"You're my sow, Silvia!</font>

586
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,497
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tell me you're my sow,</font>

587
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,123
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">or I'll break your neck."</font>

588
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,252
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you?</font>

589
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,129
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I tell him...</font>

590
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,967
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"Yeah, I'm your sow"...</font>

591
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:27,262
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but he twists my neck anyway.</font>

592
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,348
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I come like a sow,</font>

593
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,433
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">knowing that he loves me</font>

594
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:35,145
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">when I say it.</font>

595
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,565
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You love him too.</font>

596
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,235
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, I love you, feel this.</font>

597
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,242
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tell me you can't do without me.</font>

598
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:52,538
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tell me I'm your vice.</font>

599
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:23,694
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Renounce the sublimation</font>

600
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,362
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that I loved.</font>

601

602
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,909
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">D'Annunzio,
where are you?</font>

603
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,662
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tiziano,</font>

604

605
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:39,710
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Veronese and also you,
mein herrlicher Klimt.</font>

606
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:43,547
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did you ever
give me this flesh</font>

607
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:45,299
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that ignites my prick?</font>

608
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,792
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, tell me you're my sow</font>

609
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,003
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">or I'll twist your neck.</font>

610
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:50,048
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, you know I am,
I'm your sow!</font>

611
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:37,554
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Dodo, here are your stamps.</font>

612
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,729
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't want them anymore.</font>

613
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:48,356
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ill-mannered little brat!
Ill-mannered little brat!</font>

614
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,780
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Thanks for the papers.
- Weren't you asleep?</font>

615
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:40,659
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I've been awake for a while.
I saw the way you looked at me.</font>

616
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,578
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- How was I looking at you?
- With hatred.</font>

617
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:47,707
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What? I was looking at you
the way one looks at a sleeper.</font>

618
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:51,795
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Forget it then.
Your appearance must have fooled me.</font>

619
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,465
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You look pretty awful, son.
Like a castaway.</font>

620
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,759
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's with you?
Something wrong?</font>

621
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,719
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, nothing.
Everything's fine.</font>

622
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:03,598
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Good. Help me up.
What time is it?</font>

623
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,810
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- It's about 8:30.
- I slept more than usual.</font>

624
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:09,104
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Bit of a late night
last night.</font>

625
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Blame the TV. Would you mind
opening the shutters?</font>

626

with the crutches.</font>

628
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:19,614
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yeah, so it seems.</font>

629
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,867
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Aren't you happy?</font>

630
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:24,161
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, of course.</font>

631
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:29,416

as long as I was in bed,</font>

638

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Intellectual powers,
for example, or sexual.</font>

some affairs recently?</font>

about being sick</font>

645
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:18,465
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's not hard. Some girls
have a hell of a nerve.</font>

717
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,095

together last night.</font>

721
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:07,063

You can hear voices and noises.</font>

723
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,236

724
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:17,282
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It sounded like grunts</font>

725
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,825
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but gentle ones.</font>

726

731
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:51,065
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can't you see
it's almost curdling?</font>

732
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,235

733
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,739

01:16:57,864 --> 01:17:01,409

sometime around 11:30.</font>

735

to have a look</font>

these things just to be nasty?</font>

You know who said that?</font>

808
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:18,090
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A French poet named
Beaudelaire,</font>

826
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:34,286
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How about coming up here
and looking at the top floor?</font>

827
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:37,122
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Now? Well, I don't know.
- The notary moved out.</font>

830
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:44,797
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nothing. Don't misunderstand,
I have to talk to you.</font>

831

832
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:48,592
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll be at your place in an hour.</font>

833
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:52,346
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Fine, in an hour then. Bye.</font>

834
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:42,117
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">After your call, I thought
about that time in Fregene.</font>

835
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,744
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Remember?</font>

836
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:46,913
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, the first time
that you spied on me.</font>

837
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,293
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At the beginning there,
I didn't know you were onto me.</font>

838
01:33:55,756 --> 01:33:58,342
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why did you close
the shutter like that?</font>

839
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:08,685
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Just being discreet, I suppose.</font>

840
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:12,439
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Idiot.
I did what I was doing for you.</font>

841
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:16,193
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Know something?</font>

842
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:23,659
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">After you closed the window,
I masturbated.</font>

843
01:34:23,784 --> 01:34:25,994
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You never told me that.</font>

844
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:28,747
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The next day, when we met,</font>

845
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:31,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I had a strange feeling,</font>

846
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,377
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">as though you and I had
already made love.</font>

847
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:38,006
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What else have you kept from me?
You wanted to talk to me.</font>

848
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:41,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's all over.</font>

849
01:34:41,677 --> 01:34:45,180
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Since when?</font>

850
01:34:48,058 --> 01:34:50,102
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Last night.</font>

851
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:53,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did you make love?</font>

852
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:55,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes and no.</font>

853
01:34:56,066 --> 01:34:58,443
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What this "yes and no"?</font>

854
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:01,113
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We went half-way.</font>

855
01:35:01,238 --> 01:35:04,866
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He wanted me to give him
a blow-job.</font>

856
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:09,329
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">To make him happy, I did it.</font>

857
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,667
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Who was it?</font>

858
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,962
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ah, no, Dodo, I warned you.</font>

859
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No strange ideas.</font>

860
01:35:20,841 --> 01:35:23,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's gone and that's all
there is to it.</font>

861
01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:33,645
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't do it.</font>

862
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,689
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why with him and not with me?</font>

863
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:38,608
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- It's different with you.
- What's different about it?</font>

864
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:44,656
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The cock.</font>

865
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:48,118
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">His had no face, no name,</font>

866
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:51,955
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">no story, no love.</font>

867
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,126
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The cock of a stranger.
It wouldn't be like that with you.</font>

868
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:59,045
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Say that again.
- What?</font>

869
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:03,967
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Cock...
- Cock...</font>

870
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:06,928
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Okay?</font>

871
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:15,854
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can take
a picture of me if you like.</font>

872
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:23,737
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come on, shoot.</font>

873
01:36:48,345 --> 01:36:50,514
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You've got a hard-on!</font>

874
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:34,224
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If your father had given us
this apartment right away,</font>

875
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:38,270
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">lots of things would never
have happened.</font>

876
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:40,772
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">When did you start up
with the other man?</font>

877
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:43,275
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">On our wedding day.</font>

878
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:48,238
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How? Where?</font>

879
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:51,116
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At home,</font>

880

881
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:56,329
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There were a lot of people,
remember?</font>

882
01:37:56,454 --> 01:37:58,623
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At a certain point...</font>

883
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:01,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the porter came up
to tell you that the police</font>

884
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:04,379
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">were towing away some
of the guests' cars.</font>

885
01:38:04,504 --> 01:38:06,756
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You went downstairs with him,</font>

886
01:38:06,882 --> 01:38:11,177
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I went into our bedroom.</font>

887
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:20,520
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I looked out the window,</font>

888
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,856
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">you were arguing with the police.</font>

889
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:36,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Suddenly he came into the room.</font>

890
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:39,372
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He came at me...</font>

891
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:41,833
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">from behind,
he grabbed me by the neck</font>

892
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:45,253
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so I couldn't move or turn around
or defend myself.</font>

893
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:48,924
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He did it to me, just like you
wanted to do a little while ago.</font>

894
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:59,077
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Coming here was meaningless.</font>

895
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:02,539
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- There's no need to go on.
- Why meaningless?</font>

896
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:06,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We couldn't live like this</font>

897
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:08,003
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">without your dad's help.</font>

898
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,173
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So we're back
where we started.</font>

899
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:13,842
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where we started?</font>

900
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,510
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We'd be dependent on him again</font>

901
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,724
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I won't go for it.</font>

902
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,310
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What are you thinking of doing?</font>

903
01:40:24,436 --> 01:40:27,814
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Living together in the two rooms
downstairs again.</font>

904
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,649
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's why
you left in the first place!</font>

905
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:32,068
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I left because I had
another man.</font>

906
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:34,904
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Now I don't anymore.</font>

907
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:38,283
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So we can move
happily back in together.</font>

908
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,413
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Me, you</font>

909
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:45,790
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and your father.</font>

910
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:00,722
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's go tell him
we're moving back in with him.</font>

911
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,687
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come on,</font>

912
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:09,606
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">let's go.</font>

913
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:15,236
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">All right.</font>

914
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,447
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's go.</font>

1
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:25,067
VAMPYR was produced in 1931-32
in German, French, and English versions.

2
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,736
The original negative
for picture and sound was lost.

3
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,405
Partially complete prints
of the German and French versions

4
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,699
served as the basis for this restoration.

5
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,160
The new German version of 1998
was a collaboration between

6
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:39,164
Cineteca del Comune di Bologna,
Deutsche Kinemathek, and ZDF/Arte.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,906
This is the tale of the strange
adventures of young Allan Gray,

10
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:41,703
who immersed himself in the study
of devil worship and vampires.

11
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,542
Preoccupied with superstitions
of centuries past, he became a dreamer

12
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,382
for whom the line between the real
and the supernatural became blurred.

13
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:59,221
His aimless wanderings
led him late one evening

14
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:04,226
to a secluded inn by the river

15
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:08,146
in a village called Courtempierre.

16
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,018
<i>Who's there?</i>

17
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,564
Go around.

18
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,055
Good night.

19
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,248
It was an eerie moonlit night.

20
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:00,921
Light and shadow, voices and faces
seemed to take on hidden meaning.

21
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,215
Allan Gray felt a sinister force
descend upon him.

22
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,844
In vain he fought
the terror that seized him,

23
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,765
and fear of things he could not name
haunted his restless sleep.

24
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,080
Who are you?

25
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,359
Quiet!

26
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,466
She must not die! You understand?

27
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:44,084
TO BE OPENED...

28
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,923
UPON MY DEATH

29
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,815
What was going on?

30
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,152
What terrifying secret was unfolding?

31
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,488
Allan Gray felt certain of one thing:

32
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,825
A soul in mortal distress
was crying out for help,

33
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,328
and a voice within
urged him to heed that call.

34
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,057
Silence!

35
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,903
Did you hear that?

36
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes. The child.

37
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,328
The Child?

38
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,789
Yes, the Child!

39
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,591
There's no child here.

40
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,110
But the dogs!

41
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,033
There are no children or dogs here!

42
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,951
No?

43
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,912
No.

44
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,790
Good night.

45
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,502
Good night.

46
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,743
He followed the fleeting shadows
and came to a large estate

47
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,913
where a forlorn manor rose up
among ancient trees.

48
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,207
Here, in seclusion,

49
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,544
with only his two daughters
and a few servants for company,

50
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,882
lived the man who had appeared
to Allan Gray earlier at the inn.

51
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,480
The wounds have almost healed.

52
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,370
The blood!

53
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,289
The blood!

54
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,011
Don't go to bed
until the doctor arrives.

55
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,232
Open up! Hurry!

56
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,242
For heaven's sake, hurry!

57
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,786
<i>I'm coming.</i>

58
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,581
What's wrong?

59
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,334
What is it?

60
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,755
Quick! They're trying to kill him!

61
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,054
The other door.

62
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,773
Jeanne, light the lamps in the library.

63
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,903
And you stay with Giséle, you hear?

64
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,887
Is he dead?

65
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,555
Yes.

66
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,210
Won't you please stay here with us?

67
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,535
Where is he going?

68
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,704
To the police.

69
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,940
TO BE OPENED UPON MY DEATH

70
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:06,138
THE STRANGE HISTORY OF VAMPIRES

71
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,310
Accounts from many ages and lands
tell of terrible demons called vampires.

72
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,480
These are the bodies
and souls of the dead

73
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,985
whose terrible deeds in life
deny them repose in the grave.

74
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,822
Under the bright light
of the full moon,

75
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,993
they rise from their graves

76
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,330
to suck the blood of children
and young adults

77
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,500
and thus prolong
their shadowy existence.

78
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,379
The Prince of Darkness is their ally

79
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:45,302
and lends them supernatural power
among the living and the dead.

80
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:29,262
At night these creatures from the abyss

81
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:35,102
haunt the abodes of the living,

82
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:41,775
where they sow death and decay.

83
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:48,448
A vampire's victim is doomed
to perish without hope.

84
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:55,956
A wound on the throat,
as from the bite of a cat or rat,

85
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:00,627
is the mark of damnation.

86
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,755
Neither medical science...

87
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,303
Léone!

88
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,516
Where?

89
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,726
There, outside!

90
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,490
<i>Hurry!</i>

91
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,160
Léone!

92
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,329
Quick!

93
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,381
Like a plague,
the vampire's lust infects the victim,

94
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,885
who is torn between a thirst for blood

95
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,722
and a desperate repulsion
toward this craving.

96
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,851
The innocent young person
itself becomes a vampire

97
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,979
and seeks to prey
on its nearest and dearest.

98
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,192
Entire families, even entire villages,
are thus brought under the curse.

99
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,164
If I could only die!

100
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,876
No, Léone.

101
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,587
I know.

102
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,715
I'm lost.

103
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,008
I'm damned.

104
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,907
I think she's dying.

105
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,967
Didn't you hear a scream?

106
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,164
Come! The carriage is back!

107
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,260
She's asleep.

108
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,233
Good God!

109
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,947
What is that?

110
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,910
See that?

111
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,661
Blood.

112
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:13,972
The ghosts of executed criminals
are in their service,

113
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,977
but the living too may fall
under their dreadful sway.

114
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:25,483
An account from Hungary
tells of a village doctor

115
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,655
who, having sold his soul
to the Evil One,

116
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,826
became a vampire's henchman

117
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:40,832
and thus an accessory to a series
of horrid crimes in that region.

118
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,436
<i>Good evening, Doctor.</i>

119
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,856
<i>Good evening. How is she doing?</i>

120
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,526
<i>- Not well at all.
- Oh? Why is that?</i>

121
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,696
We found her out on the grounds.

122
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,949
Well, let's go see.

123
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:21,414
<i>She has another
of those marks on her neck.</i>

124
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,833
<i>We'll have a look.</i>

125
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,061
Good evening.

126
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,815
Good evening. Come along.

127
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,239
You stay down here.

128
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,932
She's doing very poorly.

129
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,436
- Pulse?
- Weak.

130
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,165
Can't she be saved?

131
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,378
Perhaps.

132
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:37,008
But she needs blood.

133
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,028
It must be human blood.

134
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,034
Are you willing to give her your own?

135
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,386
Come, young man.

136
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:30,519
I'll draw your blood.

137
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,534
Why does the doctor
always come at night?

138
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,280
Once the vampire has gained
complete control over its victim,

139
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:27,285
it seeks to drive
the victim to suicide,

140
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,290
thus delivering that soul
to the Evil One.

141
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:38,129
For he who takes his own life
is lost for all eternity.

142
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:43,968
To him the Golden Gates
of Heaven are closed.

143
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:48,472
For him all hope is lost.

144
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,528
<i>Sister.</i>

145
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,073
Come here a moment.

146
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,373
You may go to bed now.

147
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,506
Did you hear me?

148
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,572
Who can solve
the riddle of life and death

149
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:50,534
or fathom the dark secrets
hidden from the light of day?

150
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,080
For just as strange
as a vampire's existence

151
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,874
is the manner of its demise.

152
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,461
These dead who cannot find peace
must be murdered

153
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,839
to deliver a tormented humanity
from their grip.

154
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,967
Many monasteries and libraries
possess in their secret archives...

155
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,106
Doctor!

156
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,776
What's wrong?

157
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,820
I'm losing blood.

158
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,448
Nonsense! Your blood is right here!

159
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:42,586
...accounts of how vampires have been
rendered harmless in many places.

160
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,173
In the village of Kisilova,

161
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:52,346
haunted a generation ago by a vampire
in the form of an old woman,

162
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,474
the following procedure was used:

163
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,812
At dawn the grave was opened,

164
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:06,485
and the old woman
was found lying as if asleep.

165
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:11,490
An iron stake was driven
through her heart,

166
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:16,662
nailing her horrid soul to the earth.

167
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:21,667
She then died a true death,

168
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:27,965
and the curse that had lain upon her
and her victims was broken.

169
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,561
<i>Come... follow me.</i>

170
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:46,650
<i>We shall become one soul, one blood.</i>

171
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,028
<i>Follow me.</i>

172
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,490
<i>Death is waiting...</i>

173
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,872
...deliverance by the grace
of our heavenly Lord.

174
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,500
Even in these parts,

175
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,171
tradition tells how certain areas
were haunted by vampires.

176
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,758
Just 25 years ago, a murderous epidemic

177
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,595
claimed 11 victims
in the village of Courtempierre.

178
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:18,057
Doctors assigned the plague
a medical name,

179
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:21,936
but a persistent rumor
circulated among the people

180
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:26,106
that a vampire was
the cause of the scourge.

181
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,443
Many firmly believed that vampire to be

182
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:34,406
none other than Marguerite Chopin,
who lay buried in the village cemetery.

183
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:39,036
All her life, Marguerite Chopin
had been a monster in human form.

184
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,248
She died an unrepentant soul,

185
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,376
and the Church denied her
the Last Sacraments.

186
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,333
Come quickly!

187
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,627
Something terrible is happening!

188
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,838
Come quickly!

189
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,890
<i>Sister.</i>

190
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,067
I'm afraid of dying.

191
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,072
I am damned!

192
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,325
My God!

193
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,650
Sister.

194
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,780
She mustn't die.

195
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:47,910
She must live until sunrise,
you understand?

196
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,914
FROM DUST THOU ART

197
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:20,460
UNTO DUST THOU SHALT RETURN

198
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,318
Now go!

199
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,070
Quickly!

200
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,936
I feel strong.

201
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,939
My soul is free.

202
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:10,540
Ah, you're here. Open this.

203
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,667
You hear me?

204
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,377
Listen to me!

205
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,344
Listen to me!

206
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,513
Please!

207
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:13,019
Curse you, you bastard!

208
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,730
Open up!

209
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,940
Let me out of here!

210
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:25,281
Open this gate!

211
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,150
<i>Over here.</i>

212
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,662
<i>This way.</i>

1
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:39,600
The Swimming Pool

2
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,770
Jean-Paul!

3
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:10,230
Scratch my back.

4
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,414
Oh! No one scratches like you.

5
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:52,318
- You just stay. I go get it.
- Let it ring...

6
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,860
Wait here, I'll be back.

7
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,318
- Yes. I'm going.
- You stay.

8
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,799
- You stay.
- Let me go!

9
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:11,314
That was nasty.

10
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,605
Bastard.

11
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,901
Why, are you expecting a call
from someone?

12
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:17,933
No.

13
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,110
Madame, phone call for you.

14
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:27,318
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

15
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,899
Well, you should have asked.
I'm coming.

16
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,943
Hello... Yes... Who?

17
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,669
No! Is that you? Where are you?

18
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,844
I haven't heard of you for ages.
When?

19
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:41,688
Alone?

20
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:47,318
How long are you staying?
Come and visit us.

21
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,039
All right. By the road along the beach.
OK. Bye.

22
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:30,522
Who was that?

23
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,735
Do I ever ask you
when you talk to someone?

24
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:38,121
If you did, I'd answer.

25
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:07,609
Guess.

26
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,109
I don't care.

27
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:16,722
It was Harry.

28
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:19,926
- Is he around?
- Yes.

29
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:28,819
Whenever we escape somewhere,
he is the first to call...

30
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:32,277
He's with his daughter.

31
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:36,062
He's showing her the Cote d'Azur.

32
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,682
He has a daughter?

33
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:39,818
- Seems so.
- He never mentioned.

34
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,933
Neither to me.

35
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:47,098
- How old is she?
- No idea.

36
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,481
Harry's daughter!
That's something.

37
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,977
Hello, sweetie.

38
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,319
Give me a kiss.

39
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:47,735
- How are you? You look great.
- I feel great. You look fine, too.

40
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:51,776
People keep saying:
Good old Harry never changes.

41
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:55,026
Never gets better, never gets worse.
Always the same.

42
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,985
Is this your latest monster?

43
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:58,016
Yes.

44
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:02,318
I drove from Paris to St. Tropez
in 7 hours the day before yesterday.

45
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,349
You like it?

46
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,381
Oh, I don't know.

47
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:17,808
Good afternoon.

48
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:32,481
She is my daughter, Penelope.

49
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:35,318
She's Marianne, I was
telling you about her.

50
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:36,480
Say hello.

51
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,432
- Hello.
- Hello.

52
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:59,391
Jean-Paul!
I am so happy to see you.

53
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,901
- You look great, too.
- You, too.

54
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:04,610
Have a look around.
I bring something to drink.

55
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,193
Believe it or not,
she is my daughter.

56
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:08,235
You can keep a secret.

57
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,860
- Hello, Penelope.
- Hello.

58
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:11,891
Come.

59
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:13,860
We were in the area.
I met Fred.

60
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:18,396
He said you were here.
I didn't know.

61
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:22,524
You were not at home.

62
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:26,366
- You were in Canada.
- True.

63
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:32,984
This is beautiful.

64
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:43,739
This is the best thing in the cottage.

65
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:50,105
Nice big pool.

66
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:58,443
You like it?

67
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,434
Here you are. What do you drink?

68
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,943
- A scotch.
- All right.

69
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,756
Orange juice?

70
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,568
I have to be in Milan on the
17th. We travel around until then.

71
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:24,068
Pen doesn't know the area,
so I show her around.

72
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:26,074
Can I take one?

73
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:28,985
Why don't you come with us to Milan?

74
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:30,443
We like it here.

75
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,943
Jean-Paul has only a month
of vacation.

76
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:35,100
Poor Jean-Paul...

77
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:41,957
- So this is Marc's and Lucien's house?
- You haven't been here yet?

78
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:44,693
Where did they go this year?
India? Iran?

79
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:45,694
India.

80
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,192
Typical.

81
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:51,985
They offered us to use it,
so we took the opportunity.

82
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,276
Not bad...

83
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,485
You could stay.

84
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:59,541
- Here?
- There is plenty of room.

85
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:06,151
- What do you think?
- I don't mind staying.

86
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,651
No, you decide, yes or no.

87
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,068
- I don't mind.
- She doesn't mind.

88
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:16,219
- We take it as a yes. You stay.
- All right.

89
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:24,769
Wanna take a swim?

90
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:28,051
Good idea. I go get changed.

91
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:35,069
Go to the room on the ground floor.
It has a private entrance.

92
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:39,794
- You don't want to swim?
- No.

93
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:45,235
- And you don't drink anything?
- No, thanks. I am not thirsty.

94
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:49,068
- You live with your mother?
- Yes. In Lausanne.

95
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,526
Are you still in school?

96
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:55,377
- Yes. Can I have a cigarette?
- Yes.

97
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:56,891
Thank you.

98
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:10,569
You remind me of your father.

99
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:12,069
Why?

100
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:13,532
I don't know.

101
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:23,169
Come, Penelope.
I show you around in the house.

102
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:29,961
How old are you?

103
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,693
18.

104
00:14:54,902 --> 00:14:56,622
Are you having a good time?

105
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:01,151
Doesn't it look like that?

106
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:05,235
When I'm with you,
I always have a good time.

107
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,724
I don't want anything more.

108
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:11,544
Then why did you ask them to stay?

109
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,860
I thought you'd like it.

110
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:17,735
He is your friend.
Much more than mine.

111
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:21,651
But you and Harry are said to...

112
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,475
Who said that?

113
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:26,652
Quite a few people.

114
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,082
You get on my nerves.

115
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:56,156
Don't let your hair down.

116
00:17:17,527 --> 00:17:19,684
Turn around.

117
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:24,187
Turn around.

118
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:08,860
I love you... I love you.

119
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,235
Don't talk.

120
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,144
What are you thinking of?

121
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:31,902
Funny, you talk so much about others,
but never about Harry.

122
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:34,686
Not a word.

123
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,849
Because I don't have anything to say.

124
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:04,276
Sooner or later you'll have to tell.

125
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,521
What?

126
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:11,276
Maybe you spread the rumor.

127
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:14,047
And nothing happened.

128
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:17,854
That's exactly how it was.

129
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,951
I have a pretty daughter, don't I?

130
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:31,544
Not bad.

131
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,735
It's strange that you have a daughter.
You became different.

132
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:44,596
Just an accident from my youth.

133
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:47,477
- Are you sorry for that?
- Not at all!

134
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:53,151
- Who's the happy mother?
- An English girl. You don't know her.

135
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:56,017
She doesn't look like you at all.
And makes you look older.

136
00:20:56,361 --> 00:21:00,606
Don't exaggerate.
She looks older than she is.

137
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:12,110
- Are there many people in St. Tropez?
- I don't know, we don't go to town.

138
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:15,071
What do you do all day?

139
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:20,318
- You still love each other?
- Better than ever. Are you surprised?

140
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,480
No.

141
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:26,485
- Good afternoon, sir.
- I am hungry.

142
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:30,318
- Coffee is here. Still hot.
- Thank you, Emilie.

143
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,849
Smells good.

144
00:21:32,736 --> 00:21:35,943
Authentic home made coffee.
What a pleasure.

145
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:39,693
- Did you make the jam, too?
- No, sir. No.

146
00:21:39,694 --> 00:21:40,855
It's a pity.

147
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:47,401
If you run out of coffee,
there is some more in the kitchen.

148
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:49,891
Thank you.

149
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:58,264
- A charming housekeeper you have.
- Yes, indeed.

150
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,896
She used to be.

151
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,939
There is no napkin.

152
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:12,526
Are you coming, Pen?

153
00:22:12,527 --> 00:22:13,817
Later.

154
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,882
It'll get cold.

155
00:22:28,652 --> 00:22:30,037
She always pisses me off.

156
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:50,534
- You're not eating?
- I am not hungry.

157
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,443
Great coffee.

158
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,752
Is Marianne still asleep?

159
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:02,391
Probably.

160
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,194
Yes, she likes to get up late.

161
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:12,211
Is she still working?

162
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,704
Not at the moment.

163
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,735
She seems to have
let herself go a bit.

164
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:22,456
It would be a pity.

165
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:29,012
Aren't you holding her back?

166
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:34,351
Her latest article was great.

167
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:40,432
When she gives her best,
she can do miracles.

168
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:42,936
I love her.

169
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:47,110
I go wake her up.

170
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:48,568
May I?

171
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:15,860
Not bad. When will it be published?

172
00:27:15,861 --> 00:27:17,104
Soon.

173
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:18,558
Do you like it?

174
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:21,912
Yes, I like it.

175
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:24,347
Will it be a hit?

176
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:26,489
That's why I did it.

177
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,908
Is it warm outside?

178
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,695
Hot.

179
00:27:51,077 --> 00:27:52,653
What shall we do?

180
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:54,821
Whatever you want.

181
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:06,902
I'll rest tomorrow.

182
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:11,227
The rooms are so hot.

183
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:21,666
- Ah, can I try your car?
- Now?

184
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,693
Why not?

185
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:44,326
The bodywork was designed at Ghiana,
and it has a V8 engine.

186
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:49,427
Four wheel drive,
4 double carburators.

187
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:57,659
What does this wonder cost?

188
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:59,546
Very expensive.

189
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:06,704
- So you are doing well.
- Yes.

190
00:30:07,244 --> 00:30:09,951
And you? Do you like the new job?

191
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:12,026
Yes, sort of...

192
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:17,118
What do you do exactly in
an ad agency? Selling ideas?

193
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,695
Theoretically yes.

194
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:22,237
- And do you have enough?
- No.

195
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:27,731
Have you given up on literature?

196
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,399
Yes.

197
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:35,032
This was the best you could do.

198
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:43,285
There are days when I am fed up with
everything, and would like to get out.

199
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,944
That's typical of you.

200
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,576
The referee ends the game.

201
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:54,577
People from the crowd rush in,
and the players...

202
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:05,035
Good bye. I am done.

203
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:06,618
Bye, Emilie. Thanks.

204
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:07,660
Gute nacht, Emilie.

205
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:11,761
- Good night, sir.
- Good bye, Emilie.

206
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,951
- Come on!
- Wait...

207
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:25,337
You lose anyway.

208
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,910
Do you want some, Jean-Paul?

209
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:41,726
- Just a sip.
- No.

210
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:12,066
- That's the card I was waiting for. I win.
- That's not fair.

211
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:45,534
- Who won?
- Harry.

212
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:48,368
- Are you sure?
- He got his card first.

213
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:53,424
Let the old men win.
I keep saying this.

214
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:56,726
I am in good shape, right?

215
00:33:04,744 --> 00:33:07,660
Improve your arm technique.
That's your week point.

216
00:33:07,661 --> 00:33:10,621
And you are gasping for breath.

217
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,757
That's because of smoking.

218
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:30,451
Do you have my watch?

219
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:32,502
- Yes.
- Thanks.

220
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:40,451
Wouldn't you like to go out?
Won't you come with me to St. Tropez?

221
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,412
He is a hermit, you know that.

222
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:47,487
You tell me!
Anyway, I go.

223
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,951
I have a bunch of friends there.
I go visit them.

224
00:33:52,952 --> 00:33:55,868
- Are you coming with me?
- No, maybe next time.

225
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,779
I take one.

226
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,577
I am off. Bye.

227
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:03,289
- Bye.
- Bye.

228
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:06,285
If I am not here for dinner,
don't wait for me. All right.

229
00:34:06,286 --> 00:34:08,246
Bye, Pen. Be good.

230
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:59,761
- Why didn't you join him?
- I didn't feel like going.

231
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:04,951
If you want to go out, join him.

232
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:07,577
I think I would just bother him.

233
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:15,866
I bet he is not coming home alone.

234
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:22,569
- He would dare, because of his daughter.
- Come on!

235
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:40,727
- Careful! Pen must be watching.
- She is a big girl.

236
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,934
- No!
- Yes!

237
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:46,421
- No!
- Yes!

238
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:48,547
Watch out!

239
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:56,615
I'm gonna catch you.
Then you'll see...

240
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,409
Which one do you prefer?

241
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:06,244
What?

242
00:37:07,036 --> 00:37:11,851
Which of the two pellets
do you prefer?

243
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:20,863
This one. Why?

244
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:21,999
Me, too.

245
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,743
It's strange, that
we always have a preference.

246
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:28,469
Even in such small things.

247
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:34,881
Where is Harry?

248
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:04,949
Are you cold?

249
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,902
A bit.

250
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:28,697
I don't like summer.

251
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:32,017
Only the in-between seasons.

252
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:38,283
- Are you hungry?
- No.

253
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:42,451
We should eat something,
even if Harry doesn't come.

254
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:44,941
It's almost 8 o'clock.

255
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,951
How long have you known
each other?

256
00:38:52,952 --> 00:38:53,983
For two years.

257
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:55,446
Two years?

258
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:59,521
Almost two and a half.

259
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,491
And Dad?

260
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:07,863
5-6 or 7 years.

261
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:15,447
We met at his place.
Remember?

262
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:16,904
That's right.

263
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:22,494
You were like brothers back then.

264
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:27,102
We meet less frequently nowadays.

265
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:45,056
We are back.

266
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:49,818
This way, sweethearts.

267
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:57,767
Don't worry. We brought everything.

268
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:03,337
Here, take this.

269
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:05,660
The flower.

270
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:11,661
- Great. They are all your friends?
- Yes. The best ones. Here.

271
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:17,579
Behave yourselves.

272
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:25,202
Quiet. The folks who live here
don't like noise, only silence.

273
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:38,036
I don't know everyone.
But we'll get to that soon.

274
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:41,752
- Hi Pen, how are you?
- Good evening.

275
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:52,743
This is Mireille.
This is Sylvie.

276
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:53,785
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

277
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:57,221
And she is Pussy.
You met everyone?

278
00:40:58,286 --> 00:40:59,535
And that young man?

279
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:01,822
- Who? Me?
- No, him.

280
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,076
I am Alain, madame.

281
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:06,747
- Then come and give me a hand.
- My pleasure.

282
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:11,942
Pen, come dance with me.
Don't be so stubborn.

283
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:24,318
Take it and pour.

284
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:33,452
- Try to behave yourself. Please.
- Why should I open it? I don't drink.

285
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,701
How interesting!

286
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:24,826
There are so many people
having an easy life.

287
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:30,368
And I don't even know how to get
my emotional problems under control.

288
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:34,201
The trouble with me is that whenever
a woman shows interest in me

289
00:44:34,202 --> 00:44:37,868
I immediately fall in love with her,
and get paralized.

290
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:41,826
It's because when I was young,
I didn't live life to the full.

291
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:45,660
I was a virgin until the age of 25,
my second marriage.

292
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:47,118
That's the reason.

293
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:54,409
- Is it true what he is saying?
- Unfortunately no. No, it isn't.

294
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:16,910
It would have been ideal for me.

295
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:20,201
I adore Switzerland.
Beautiful country.

296
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:28,160
- Excuse me...
- Where are you going?

297
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:32,451
- Wait for me. I'll be back.
- What's your name?

298
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:54,114
Why did you leave?

299
00:45:54,744 --> 00:45:58,849
I was bored with that guy
and his emotional problems.

300
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:03,931
- Have you seen Dad and Marianne?
- Yes.

301
00:46:04,536 --> 00:46:08,660
- And you are not bothered?
- It's nothing.

302
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:09,733
You think so?

303
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,576
There are evenings when you are
free to do anything. Or almost anything.

304
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:18,247
Indeed it's nothing.

305
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,234
I am scared, but I don't know why.

306
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:56,285
The sky is almost pure white,
not blue.

307
00:47:56,286 --> 00:47:59,291
It'll be extremely hot again.

308
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:36,244
Here you are.

309
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:37,451
What time is it?

310
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:38,779
Almost noon.

311
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:44,579
- Are the others up yet?
- I haven't seen anybody.

312
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:51,910
You have nice wrinkles.

313
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:54,346
Look at yourself then.

314
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:58,691
I don't feel like getting up.

315
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:02,743
I have these moody days.
Like today, for example.

316
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:05,368
I would like to skip this day.

317
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:09,709
Stay in bed then.
Shall I close the curtains?

318
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:15,243
Yesterday evening Harry
was very kind with you.

319
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:19,326
He is always kind with women.
It's a good feeling.

320
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:22,527
How about her daughter?

321
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:25,863
What do you mean her daughter?

322
00:49:26,202 --> 00:49:27,743
Nothing...

323
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,729
How do you like her?

324
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:32,950
It's you who should answer this question.

325
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:35,236
Interesting girl.

326
00:49:38,786 --> 00:49:42,651
If I figure it right,
I'd better pack and leave.

327
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:46,699
You can wait a little.

328
00:50:01,494 --> 00:50:02,879
Pen, darling...

329
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:07,776
I wouldn't want anybody else,
but you.

330
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:11,047
Your skin is silky,

331
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:15,234
you smell good.

332
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:20,035
Did you sleep well?

333
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:21,493
Not really.

334
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:23,904
Well, anyway,

335
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,981
you'll have plenty of time to sleep.

336
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:33,122
One day you'll get married anyhow.

337
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,863
May I?

338
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:43,367
Thank you, maybe later.

339
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:54,118
What are you reading?

340
00:50:56,911 --> 00:50:58,154
Is it a good book?

341
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:01,857
I think, I've read this before.

342
00:51:05,786 --> 00:51:10,506
- I hope you are not bored here.
- I am not bored.

343
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,459
You know what I have in mind?

344
00:51:22,536 --> 00:51:27,118
How about going to Venice after Milan,
just the two of us.

345
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,576
So, what do you think?

346
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:30,722
- Venice?
- Yes.

347
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:46,486
- Hi.
- Hi.

348
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,901
Good morning...

349
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:55,384
- Is this your cup?
- Yes, but feel free to use it.

350
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:03,700
- You want some?
- Yes, a little.

351
00:52:04,327 --> 00:52:05,571
Thank you.

352
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,743
Did you have trouble getting up again?

353
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:12,951
- More than ever before.
- Your body is weak.

354
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:16,069
I know.
You keep saying this all the time.

355
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:22,035
Because I care for you.
That's the way it should be.

356
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,868
When is the wedding?
I hope to be your witness.

357
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:28,701
- What wedding?
- With Marianne.

358
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:33,160
You know that you'll
marry her sooner or later.

359
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:36,926
You'll have a great life together,
she is a great cook.

360
00:52:38,577 --> 00:52:40,449
You should marry her.

361
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:43,910
I've given up on marriage
for a while.

362
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:47,536
I am only interested in
caring for my daughter now.

363
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:50,368
But you should get married.
It fits your style.

364
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,111
Leave me alone.

365
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:54,618
You are like a bear with a sore head
this morning.

366
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:57,579
Yes, I got out of bed
on the wrong side.

367
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,193
Take my advice.

368
00:53:01,702 --> 00:53:06,282
Change your wishes,
not the world.

369
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:33,076
I go shopping,
before the shops close.

370
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,201
Shall I join you?

371
00:53:34,202 --> 00:53:36,201
- Harry, will you give me a lift?
- Yes.

372
00:53:36,202 --> 00:53:40,368
I go shopping. I'd like to
try your car.

373
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:42,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:45,368
I'm coming right back.

375
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:46,804
You look good.

376
00:53:51,202 --> 00:53:52,529
I get dressed.

377
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:22,539
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

378
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:28,841
I'm going to shave.

379
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:40,367
You must be utterly bored here.

380
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:43,746
It's kind of you that you don't show it.

381
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:49,596
- The teacher is the murderer.
- I know. Thank you.

382
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:53,774
Good.

383
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:24,618
This was a very difficult period for him.

384
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:27,451
That book meant a lot to him.

385
00:57:27,452 --> 00:57:30,576
He was desperate.
And then...

386
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:32,743
- Didn't he restart it from scatch?
- I don't think so.

387
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:36,826
It is said that you
never fail twice in row.

388
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:38,154
Yes, I know.

389
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:46,026
He is much better now.

390
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:48,285
He stopped drinking
from one day to the other.

391
00:57:48,286 --> 00:57:50,368
He changed his life,
took this job.

392
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:54,326
- Does he like it?
- Sort of, you know him.

393
00:57:54,327 --> 00:58:00,327
He always wants something he can't have.
He hasn't changed in this aspect.

394
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:05,155
Are you going to stay with him?

395
00:58:05,244 --> 00:58:08,154
I get along with him very well.

396
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,529
Great.

397
00:58:11,202 --> 00:58:14,497
I feel he still needs me.

398
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:18,160
I could never get along so well
with anybody.

399
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,191
Really.

400
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:25,451
You know, I really hated
loneliness... my work.

401
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:27,457
I was fed up.

402
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:36,408
He never visited me before.

403
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:41,618
My mother told everyone
he was dead. Drowned in the sea.

404
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,775
And I believed it.

405
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:48,349
I didn't miss him until last year.

406
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:53,694
One day he just arrived,
and now he is around all the time.

407
00:58:53,994 --> 00:58:59,326
He wants me to go out with him.
He takes me everywhere.

408
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:02,660
He enjoys it, when people
believe I'm his girlfriend.

409
00:59:02,661 --> 00:59:04,326
He likes that very much.

410
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:08,576
He denies it and says:
"Come on, she is my daughter."

411
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:13,012
But hopes at the same time,
that they don't believe him.

412
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:18,576
And then... he gives advice.
He cares about me.

413
00:59:18,577 --> 00:59:22,012
He wants to know
what I'm doing all the time.

414
00:59:23,286 --> 00:59:25,785
Last week he had the sudden idea

415
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:28,456
that he takes me to Italy.

416
00:59:28,702 --> 00:59:31,617
I didn't ask him anything.

417
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:36,618
I couldn't tell him
I didn't want to go.

418
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:38,339
That's just not possible.

419
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:45,984
He says that he is bored with Marianne,

420
00:59:46,411 --> 00:59:49,325
that he let you have her,

421
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:54,854
but can get her back,
whenever he wants.

422
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:02,865
He also says
you are untalented.

423
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:07,441
He doesn't like you.

424
01:00:09,327 --> 01:00:11,237
He doesn't like anybody.

425
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:17,186
But he expects everyone
to adore him.

426
01:00:38,077 --> 01:00:40,744
So you are going to Milan?

427
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:42,243
Yes, but not right now.

428
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:45,243
I'd like to talk to you before you leave.
Will you come over one evening?

429
01:00:45,244 --> 01:00:48,054
- I promise.
- Bye.

430
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,118
Good evening, Emilie. No one's here?

431
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,410
- They've just left.
- Really?

432
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:27,243
I was waiting for you.
I didn't want to leave the house unattended.

433
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:29,618
- Yes, that's good.
- May I leave now, madame?

434
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:34,099
- You may. Thank you, Emilie.
- Thank you.

435
01:01:34,536 --> 01:01:37,451
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

436
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:41,222
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Emilie.

437
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:45,086
- No one's here?
- No one.

438
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:51,826
- Can I help you?
- If you feel like.

439
01:01:51,827 --> 01:01:54,410
- We'll have Chinese.
- Good.

440
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,606
- Will you prepare the rice?
- Yes.

441
01:02:00,577 --> 01:02:02,392
As usual.

442
01:02:51,827 --> 01:02:53,699
Don't do this to me!

443
01:02:53,786 --> 01:02:55,243
Aren't you ashamed?

444
01:02:55,244 --> 01:02:57,116
Never.

445
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:03,362
You suddenly appear like this...

446
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:07,236
You are wonderful.

447
01:03:08,369 --> 01:03:11,486
It's a pity that...

448
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:13,701
You want something to drink?

449
01:03:13,702 --> 01:03:14,816
Yes.

450
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:36,151
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

451
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:45,076
- Will you button up my dress?
- Sure.

452
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:57,240
You are crazy...
They can be here any moment.

453
01:04:15,036 --> 01:04:17,026
Good evening.

454
01:04:17,244 --> 01:04:21,076
Where have you two been?
We almost started dinner without you.

455
01:04:21,077 --> 01:04:22,326
I wanted to swim in the sea,

456
01:04:22,327 --> 01:04:24,201
but it was too crowded on the way back.

457
01:04:24,202 --> 01:04:25,364
Dinner's ready.

458
01:04:25,452 --> 01:04:28,697
Come. Everything is ready.

459
01:04:41,202 --> 01:04:43,785
Eat, you must be hungry.

460
01:04:43,786 --> 01:04:45,444
Thank you.

461
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:48,993
Did you have a swim, too?

462
01:04:48,994 --> 01:04:50,570
Yes.

463
01:04:52,536 --> 01:04:54,116
Did you like the water?

464
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:57,743
Very much.
There was a bit of wind though.

465
01:04:57,744 --> 01:05:00,576
I thought you didn't like swimming.

466
01:05:00,577 --> 01:05:03,148
I like the sea.

467
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,743
Not that way.
Don't you know how to use it?

468
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:15,243
- You hold one stick like this.
- Right.

469
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:20,451
Then you put the other one above,
and move it with your finger.

470
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:25,272
I will never manage this.
I go get the rice.

471
01:05:50,161 --> 01:05:54,786
- Did you cook this?
- No, just warmed it up.

472
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,824
It's ready made.

473
01:05:58,577 --> 01:06:00,487
Well, not really.

474
01:06:01,202 --> 01:06:04,257
You have to add some spices.

475
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:07,022
Some pepper, some saffron.

476
01:06:08,786 --> 01:06:10,776
It's tasteless otherwise.

477
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:15,779
Perfect.

478
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:22,904
You have to fry the rice
to make it good.

479
01:06:23,994 --> 01:06:27,241
Good rice is very rare.

480
01:06:28,911 --> 01:06:31,076
I love Chinese cuisine.

481
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:34,201
They cut everything into small pieces.
There's no waste.

482
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:35,778
And it's light.

483
01:06:42,327 --> 01:06:46,487
Vietnamese cuisine is even better.

484
01:06:48,286 --> 01:06:51,101
And the restaurants in Amsterdam,

485
01:06:52,036 --> 01:06:54,118
the Indonesian ones...

486
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,644
they are fantastic.

487
01:06:56,286 --> 01:06:57,447
Remember?

488
01:07:27,327 --> 01:07:28,986
You don't like it?

489
01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:35,155
I go to bed.

490
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,535
Good night.

491
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:40,536
Good night.

492
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:43,070
Good night, Pen.

493
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:52,452
I hope she didn't catch cold.

494
01:07:52,952 --> 01:07:54,611
I don't think so.

495
01:07:56,411 --> 01:08:01,516
The first swim of the year
always makes you feel tired.

496
01:08:15,786 --> 01:08:20,841
I check if she needs anything,
and be right back.

497
01:08:28,494 --> 01:08:31,834
Where did you swim?
At the Pampelone?

498
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:35,052
No, a bit more up.

499
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:40,727
- Was it crowded?
- No, it was late.

500
01:08:41,411 --> 01:08:43,991
So many mosquitoes this evening!

501
01:08:45,036 --> 01:08:48,091
Yes.
They are attracted by the light.

502
01:09:14,744 --> 01:09:16,826
Forgive me.
I leave you now.

503
01:09:16,827 --> 01:09:18,569
Where are you going?

504
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:22,118
I promised Fred to visit him
before I leave.

505
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:23,979
- You are leaving?
- Yes.

506
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,527
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.

507
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:32,451
- You could have told us.
- I though I did.

508
01:09:32,452 --> 01:09:36,742
- And Penelope?
- She comes with me, of course.

509
01:09:37,952 --> 01:09:42,535
Her mother would kill me,
if she found out I left her behind.

510
01:09:42,536 --> 01:09:44,206
I'll be back soon.

511
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:47,142
I don't want to go to bed late.

512
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:50,866
See you in the morning.

513
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:19,996
You know you are free?
Completely.

514
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:24,431
- Why do you say that?
- You know why.

515
01:10:25,577 --> 01:10:30,868
You are not forced to stay with me,
if you want, you can go upstairs.

516
01:10:30,869 --> 01:10:35,361
- No. It's fine here.
- It's my fault.

517
01:10:36,411 --> 01:10:38,697
Possible.

518
01:10:39,827 --> 01:10:45,368
You are Pisces, your ascendent is Aquarius.
You need love.

519
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:46,618
And you don't know about it.

520
01:10:46,619 --> 01:10:48,775
What are you suggesting?

521
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:51,285
Nothing.

522
01:10:53,494 --> 01:10:59,494
Go to her, if you want, don't stay here.
She is leaving tomorrow.

523
01:11:03,994 --> 01:11:05,985
I am leaving, too.

524
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:10,368
Tomorrow or the day after.

525
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:13,374
There is no reason for me to stay.

526
01:11:13,494 --> 01:11:14,524
Are you going home?

527
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:15,952
Yes.

528
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:20,858
And me?

529
01:11:23,286 --> 01:11:25,816
You do whatever you want.

530
01:11:31,202 --> 01:11:33,572
Is it because of Pen?

531
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:44,192
Forgive me.

532
01:11:50,244 --> 01:11:54,368
Don't worry about me,
everything is all right.

533
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:56,485
I expected it...

534
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:01,410
You've been looking
for something lately.

535
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:04,410
You caught the first one
crossing your way.

536
01:12:04,411 --> 01:12:07,743
And it's Harry's daughter.
Makes it more exciting for you.

537
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:10,844
You don't know what
you are talking, Marianne.

538
01:12:13,077 --> 01:12:15,993
I don't know what's on your mind...

539
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:20,160
What are your plans with that girl?
I have no idea.

540
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:22,071
There's nothing between us.

541
01:12:25,452 --> 01:12:28,412
The only thing I can say is

542
01:12:34,744 --> 01:12:37,889
that you are doing a foolish thing.

543
01:12:47,744 --> 01:12:52,369
I go upstairs. Shall I switch off
the light in the living room?

544
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,111
Please, don't.

545
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:56,712
- Are you sleeping downstairs?
- Yes.

546
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:58,699
Good night.

547
01:13:01,202 --> 01:13:02,492
Good night.

548
01:15:27,952 --> 01:15:30,986
Damn it. Shit.

549
01:15:33,994 --> 01:15:38,368
This damn door.
Why is is half open?

550
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:42,904
Where the hell am I going to
get the car fixed?

551
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:49,109
- In Italy.
- Fuck.

552
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:51,905
You have a cigarette?

553
01:15:52,869 --> 01:15:54,410
There it is.

554
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,242
- You are alone.
- Yes.

555
01:16:28,577 --> 01:16:32,247
- Both of them are asleep?
- For a long time.

556
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:35,476
If I had known, I would have
taken you with me.

557
01:16:37,036 --> 01:16:39,611
- Are you leaving tomorrow?
- Yes.

558
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,693
Are you drinking again?

559
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:47,029
- Since when?
- Since tonight.

560
01:16:49,202 --> 01:16:51,637
Great. It's your business.

561
01:16:53,161 --> 01:16:55,881
You are happy about it, aren't you?

562
01:16:57,244 --> 01:17:00,159
Why would I care?

563
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:50,031
Why don't you go to sleep?

564
01:18:12,452 --> 01:18:14,111
What do you want?

565
01:18:14,827 --> 01:18:17,031
Have you been waiting for me?

566
01:18:19,202 --> 01:18:23,352
Do you want to say something?
Go on! Say it!

567
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:27,541
Do you want to talk about Penelope?

568
01:18:29,327 --> 01:18:33,493
You little daydreamer...
Poor little loser.

569
01:18:33,494 --> 01:18:35,868
You can say goodbye to Penelope.
No more Penelope.

570
01:18:35,869 --> 01:18:39,116
I take her tomorrow. Done.

571
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:41,816
Finished.

572
01:18:49,398 --> 01:18:51,070
What do you think?

573
01:18:53,318 --> 01:18:55,054
This can last for a long time?

574
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:59,096
Do you think we will still put up
with your whims for long?

575
01:19:03,398 --> 01:19:05,673
I liked you when you were 17.

576
01:19:07,678 --> 01:19:09,430
We were totally crazy.

577
01:19:09,558 --> 01:19:12,391
Life was a game to you, every day.

578
01:19:12,558 --> 01:19:15,231
You even tried to commit suicide.

579
01:19:16,978 --> 01:19:19,446
Was it real or not?

580
01:19:20,658 --> 01:19:22,296
We never found out.

581
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:28,008
It was convenient though.
You were treated like a sick person.

582
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,156
Nobody was allowed to get on your nerves
or contradict you.

583
01:19:35,518 --> 01:19:38,237
'Jean-Paul has to be treated with respect'.

584
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:41,310
That's what Marianne used to say.

585
01:19:43,858 --> 01:19:45,316
And now...

586
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:48,649
What will happen to Marianne?

587
01:19:49,578 --> 01:19:51,694
Have you thought about her?

588
01:19:52,818 --> 01:19:57,573
No, you don't care at all.
It doesn't interest you anymore.

589
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:01,713
You want everything at once.

590
01:20:03,058 --> 01:20:04,776
A spoiled child...

591
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:08,270
Poor idiot.

592
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:12,876
And now you've slept with my daughter.

593
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:16,831
You're happy now, right?

594
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,595
Why do you say this?

595
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,237
You know I've always been
stronger than you.

596
01:20:35,238 --> 01:20:38,293
You couldn't do no harm to me ever.

597
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:44,300
So you jump on my daughter.
She's 18!

598
01:20:44,488 --> 01:20:47,107
Easy target.

599
01:20:48,363 --> 01:20:50,650
And now you are proud.

600
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:55,316
- You can be.
- Are you jealous?

601
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:06,902
Help me out!

602
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:09,892
Help me!

603
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:27,525
Help!

604
01:21:34,822 --> 01:21:38,022
Stop fooling around.

605
01:22:00,738 --> 01:22:03,779
Stop being an asshole.
Help!

606
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:07,821
I am cold. I had too much to drink.

607
01:22:37,822 --> 01:22:42,775
I have cramp. My stomach aches.
Help!

608
01:22:42,822 --> 01:22:45,736
Stop it!

609
01:22:46,155 --> 01:22:48,774
Help!

610
01:22:58,988 --> 01:23:01,477
Are you crazy?

611
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:41,370
I couldn't swim in it any more.

612
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:43,860
We'll empty it tomorrow.

613
01:29:44,697 --> 01:29:47,315
That'll be even worse.

614
01:29:49,072 --> 01:29:51,696
No news from your mother yet?

615
01:29:51,697 --> 01:29:52,727
No.

616
01:29:52,947 --> 01:29:54,605
But you did let her know?

617
01:29:55,447 --> 01:29:58,237
She must have read it in the papers.

618
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:00,737
Anyway, she doesn't mind.

619
01:30:00,738 --> 01:30:02,528
Good bye.

620
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:10,946
I can't imagine him old,

621
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:14,063
with wrinkles and grey hair.

622
01:30:17,822 --> 01:30:21,877
Very few people came to the funeral.
Surprising.

623
01:30:22,405 --> 01:30:24,691
Everybody's on vacation.

624
01:30:25,447 --> 01:30:29,547
At least the record company
sent somebody.

625
01:30:31,072 --> 01:30:35,112
It was terrible to see
the director leaving in his car.

626
01:30:35,113 --> 01:30:37,732
He was so proud of it.

627
01:30:55,238 --> 01:30:58,578
I prepared some cold buffet.

628
01:30:58,863 --> 01:31:00,946
In case you get hungry.

629
01:31:00,947 --> 01:31:04,478
Thank you, Emilie. You are very kind.

630
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:21,040
I wonder if his daughter
feels bad.

631
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:25,228
- Are you mad at me?
- Why?

632
01:31:26,572 --> 01:31:31,722
Because so many things have changed
in so little time.

633
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,029
You do whatever you want.
I can't stay here.

634
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,700
I'm leaving tomorrow.

635
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:43,231
I'm leaving, too.
As soon as possible.

636
01:31:43,447 --> 01:31:45,319
Are you taking her home?

637
01:31:45,655 --> 01:31:48,855
I can't let her go alone.

638
01:31:50,947 --> 01:31:56,152
I would leave this evening, if I could,
but it's too late.

639
01:32:23,863 --> 01:32:27,321
- Good afternoon. Excuse me.
- Yes?

640
01:32:27,322 --> 01:32:31,517
I am inspector Leveque
from Marseille.

641
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:34,900
You must be Mr. Leroy.

642
01:32:39,905 --> 01:32:42,737
It's just a routine check.

643
01:32:42,738 --> 01:32:45,112
We investigate every accident.

644
01:32:45,113 --> 01:32:47,593
I know it's annoying.

645
01:32:53,363 --> 01:32:55,934
Madame...

646
01:33:04,905 --> 01:33:07,607
I am inspector Leveque.

647
01:33:08,155 --> 01:33:11,110
It's just formality.

648
01:33:11,572 --> 01:33:13,362
The police have been here
a couple of times.

649
01:33:13,363 --> 01:33:16,279
Yes, I know. I read their report.

650
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,571
11 pages, but no matter
how thorough they are

651
01:33:18,572 --> 01:33:22,321
something always escapes their attention.

652
01:33:22,322 --> 01:33:26,277
- Please, take a seat.
- Thank you.

653
01:33:27,947 --> 01:33:32,112
- Are you just having lunch?
- No problem.

654
01:33:32,113 --> 01:33:36,071
It won't take long.
I just have a few questions.

655
01:33:36,072 --> 01:33:37,217
Cigarette?

656
01:33:37,322 --> 01:33:41,282
- No, thank you. I have mine.
- Yes.

657
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:46,691
Sorry.

658
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:53,237
This is about Mr. Harry Lannier's death,
of course.

659
01:33:53,238 --> 01:33:56,987
According to the doctor he drowned
at around 4 am.

660
01:33:56,988 --> 01:33:57,988
Yes...

661
01:34:00,863 --> 01:34:02,321
Was he a good swimmer?

662
01:34:03,863 --> 01:34:05,653
Yes, very good.

663
01:34:07,322 --> 01:34:09,988
Was he the sort of man, who...

664
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:11,940
how to say...

665
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:17,184
Is she Miss Lannier?

666
01:34:17,613 --> 01:34:18,987
Yes.

667
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:26,510
Inspector Leveque from Marseille.

668
01:34:26,572 --> 01:34:29,242
My condolences.

669
01:34:30,322 --> 01:34:33,571
I have a few questions to ask.

670
01:34:33,572 --> 01:34:37,337
- You can stay, if you want.
- Thank you.

671
01:34:40,655 --> 01:34:43,025
Thank you.

672
01:34:44,072 --> 01:34:46,571
Was Mr. Lannier in the habit of
swimming at night?

673
01:34:46,572 --> 01:34:48,242
Sometimes he did.

674
01:34:50,113 --> 01:34:55,218
You discovered the body, madame,
didn't you?

675
01:34:55,447 --> 01:34:58,882
- Yes, it was me.
- Yes, in the pool.

676
01:34:59,822 --> 01:35:03,737
- And where were his clothes?
- On the shore.

677
01:35:05,655 --> 01:35:08,439
Listen to this.

678
01:35:08,863 --> 01:35:11,904
Light blue garbadine pants,
light blue cotton shirt,

679
01:35:11,905 --> 01:35:16,071
folded on an aluminium coffee table.

680
01:35:16,072 --> 01:35:18,862
As you see, it's quite detailed.

681
01:35:18,863 --> 01:35:22,404
- Do you agree with the police?
- Yes.

682
01:35:22,405 --> 01:35:27,840
- Did you see Mr. Lannier in the evening?
- Yes, of course.

683
01:35:28,572 --> 01:35:31,482
- You, too, I suppose.
- Sure.

684
01:35:32,947 --> 01:35:35,237
What did Mr. Lannier wear

685
01:35:35,238 --> 01:35:39,066
when he left for St. Tropez?
Did he have blue trousers on?

686
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,737
Yes.

687
01:35:42,322 --> 01:35:44,608
And blue shirt?

688
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,750
I think so.

689
01:35:48,572 --> 01:35:52,196
- You are not sure?
- Not really.

690
01:35:52,197 --> 01:35:53,917
How about you, sir?

691
01:35:54,905 --> 01:35:58,770
I don't know. I wasn't
paying attention. Maybe.

692
01:35:58,863 --> 01:36:01,150
No problem, doesn't matter.

693
01:36:04,197 --> 01:36:08,862
You slept downstairs in the living room
that night, right?

694
01:36:08,863 --> 01:36:11,779
- Yes. It's more calm down there.
- Can I have a look around?

695
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,695
Yes, of course.

696
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,362
Still, when Mr. Lannier

697
01:36:33,363 --> 01:36:38,154
hit the gate with his car,
you didn't hear a thing?

698
01:36:38,155 --> 01:36:41,305
No, nothing. I took a sleeping pill.

699
01:36:42,113 --> 01:36:44,696
We've been asked all this.

700
01:36:44,697 --> 01:36:46,752
Of course, I know,

701
01:36:46,905 --> 01:36:52,404
but I have to conduct some
more investigation in the case.

702
01:36:52,405 --> 01:36:55,654
I have to tell you, you are
not really helpful.

703
01:36:55,655 --> 01:36:56,945
Let's see.

704
01:36:57,322 --> 01:37:02,377
We know that Mr. Lannier
has drowned in the pool.

705
01:37:02,822 --> 01:37:04,480
But how?

706
01:37:05,322 --> 01:37:10,327
- While he was swimming, right?
- Yes, while he was swimming.

707
01:37:11,572 --> 01:37:13,292
With his watch on?

708
01:37:21,363 --> 01:37:25,843
Do you often swim wearing a watch?

709
01:37:26,697 --> 01:37:29,897
I do. Mine is waterproof.

710
01:37:30,447 --> 01:37:33,552
Mr. Lannier's wasn't.

711
01:37:36,905 --> 01:37:40,520
It's a quality golden watch.

712
01:37:44,488 --> 01:37:49,196
Maybe he forgot about it.
I heard, he had been drinking.

713
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,353
That's true.

714
01:37:51,988 --> 01:37:55,112
He was seen drinking a lot.
Drinking and dancing.

715
01:37:55,113 --> 01:37:58,308
You are right. He must have forgotten it.

716
01:37:58,655 --> 01:38:01,144
Good, I am leaving.

717
01:38:02,738 --> 01:38:08,029
If you remember anything,
a detail, please, let me know.

718
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:13,180
- What detail?
- I don't know. Maybe you know.

719
01:38:14,405 --> 01:38:16,779
Are you staying for a while?

720
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,070
We'd like to leave as soon as possible.

721
01:38:19,613 --> 01:38:21,106
I'm sorry, but

722
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:26,696
I'd like to ask you to stay
until the case is closed.

723
01:38:26,697 --> 01:38:29,942
- Does it take long?
- A few days.

724
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:34,279
Miss Lannier can go home
to her mother, of course.

725
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:39,140
All right. See you soon.
Excuse me...

726
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,899
Good bye.

727
01:40:39,197 --> 01:40:41,566
Hello? Hi Fred.

728
01:40:43,155 --> 01:40:44,825
Yes, we're doing fine.

729
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:49,070
Marianne, too, slowly.

730
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,696
I don't know exactly,
it depends.

731
01:40:54,697 --> 01:40:57,102
Yes, yes.

732
01:40:58,447 --> 01:41:00,167
We're not moving out.

733
01:41:00,947 --> 01:41:03,565
Right. Bye.

734
01:41:07,822 --> 01:41:09,480
It was Fred.

735
01:41:13,363 --> 01:41:16,083
He may come over in the afternoon.

736
01:41:19,197 --> 01:41:22,111
Not him again!

737
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:56,988
- Good afternoon, miss.
- Good afternoon.

738
01:41:57,197 --> 01:41:59,822
- You didn't leave?
- No.

739
01:42:00,863 --> 01:42:04,196
Do I remember correctly,
your mother is picking you up?

740
01:42:04,197 --> 01:42:06,487
No, Jean-Paul takes me home.

741
01:42:06,488 --> 01:42:07,602
Mr. Leroy?

742
01:42:14,613 --> 01:42:20,613
Excuse me. I must talk
with the lady alone. May I?

743
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:29,612
Good afternoon, madame, miss...
I am back. Good afternoon.

744
01:42:29,613 --> 01:42:33,571
- Can we talk privately?
- Shall we go in?

745
01:42:33,572 --> 01:42:36,577
No. It's better here.
Come.

746
01:42:54,488 --> 01:42:58,448
How long have you been
together with Mr. Leroy?

747
01:42:58,863 --> 01:43:00,854
More than two years.

748
01:43:02,822 --> 01:43:07,321
I was just informed, that
he's taking Miss Lannier home.

749
01:43:07,322 --> 01:43:09,042
That's the way it should be.

750
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:13,446
- Have you been thinking since yesterday?
- No.

751
01:43:13,447 --> 01:43:15,521
I have.

752
01:43:18,155 --> 01:43:20,970
I was thinking about the watch story.

753
01:43:21,572 --> 01:43:24,821
There is another part in the report.

754
01:43:24,822 --> 01:43:28,779
The policemen noticed that
Mr. Lannier's pockets were empty.

755
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,450
Completely empty.

756
01:43:30,947 --> 01:43:34,952
No tobacco pieces, no coins,
nothing.

757
01:43:36,363 --> 01:43:39,558
And no sweat stains.

758
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:44,696
Everything was clean,
looked freshly washed.

759
01:43:44,697 --> 01:43:47,529
Although Mr. Lannier
drank a lot that night.

760
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,900
Did he dance a lot?

761
01:43:53,447 --> 01:43:57,742
You know, he may very well
have been pushed into the pool.

762
01:43:58,988 --> 01:44:02,612
Then his clothes could have been hidden,
replaced by some other.

763
01:44:02,613 --> 01:44:06,275
The result would be the same.

764
01:44:10,738 --> 01:44:14,838
Did you have a close relationship
with Mr. Lannier?

765
01:44:15,738 --> 01:44:18,357
I have known him for a long time.

766
01:44:20,947 --> 01:44:23,613
Have you ever been his lover?

767
01:44:23,655 --> 01:44:24,685
Yes.

768
01:44:24,822 --> 01:44:27,112
But that was four years ago.

769
01:44:27,113 --> 01:44:29,279
Was it a public affair,
I mean

770
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,362
did Mr. Leroy know about it?

771
01:44:31,363 --> 01:44:32,612
He suspected something, but...

772
01:44:32,613 --> 01:44:35,112
Hasn't Mr. Lannier been trying to
approach you in the past few days?

773
01:44:35,113 --> 01:44:36,498
Not really.

774
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:44,800
Maybe it's nothing.

775
01:45:04,697 --> 01:45:07,737
Hello, Mr. Leroy.
Sorry for disturbing you again.

776
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:12,112
- Are you closing the case?
- Yes, I think, I hope.

777
01:45:12,113 --> 01:45:14,696
- Have you found anything new?
- No, nothing.

778
01:45:14,697 --> 01:45:16,901
Can we leave then?

779
01:45:17,113 --> 01:45:20,321
- Soon. I hope.
- But when?

780
01:45:20,322 --> 01:45:23,029
Maybe tomorrow.
Latest on the day after tomorrow.

781
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:27,700
- I'll let you know. Good bye.
- Bye.

782
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:33,651
- Hi.
- Hi.

783
01:46:36,905 --> 01:46:39,612
We don't talk to
each other any more?

784
01:46:39,613 --> 01:46:41,569
Why do you say this?

785
01:46:44,613 --> 01:46:47,573
You haven't talked to me since morning.

786
01:46:48,988 --> 01:46:51,559
And what should I say?

787
01:46:51,988 --> 01:46:56,154
I've been thinking about him
all the time since he died. And you?

788
01:46:56,155 --> 01:46:57,813
Me too.

789
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:05,232
I watch you,

790
01:47:05,738 --> 01:47:11,458
watch you eat, walk,
answer the phone.

791
01:47:12,738 --> 01:47:16,458
It's like this is the first time I see you.

792
01:47:21,155 --> 01:47:25,237
Now that the investigation is over,
when are you leaving?

793
01:47:25,238 --> 01:47:28,148
Why do you think it's over?

794
01:47:28,447 --> 01:47:31,357
Did the inspector say something?

795
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:35,730
- No.
- What did he say?

796
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:39,274
Nothing.

797
01:47:46,155 --> 01:47:49,437
...but you know, Harry's clothes,

798
01:47:49,488 --> 01:47:53,208
the ones we found by the pool,

799
01:47:53,363 --> 01:47:58,571
he didn't wear them that night
according to the inspector.

800
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:00,112
What makes him think that?

801
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:06,160
They were clean, no sweat,
no nothing.

802
01:48:11,155 --> 01:48:13,395
And his shirt

803
01:48:13,447 --> 01:48:16,571
wasn't blue, it was white.
I remember now.

804
01:48:16,572 --> 01:48:19,102
I remember very well.

805
01:48:21,572 --> 01:48:23,776
He says

806
01:48:24,613 --> 01:48:28,858
Harry may have been
pushed into the pool

807
01:48:28,988 --> 01:48:31,477
and drowned.

808
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:35,750
Then his clothes were changed.

809
01:48:41,363 --> 01:48:45,937
He says he may have been murdered.

810
01:49:05,447 --> 01:49:09,606
He believes it was you who killed him.

811
01:49:13,988 --> 01:49:15,860
Understand?

812
01:49:17,113 --> 01:49:19,270
No.

813
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:25,160
That's why he came back.
He's looking for evidence.

814
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,941
What evidence?

815
01:49:34,488 --> 01:49:36,775
Well

816
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,862
maybe simply

817
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:45,860
some used clothes
hidden in a corner.

818
01:49:50,113 --> 01:49:51,353
Have you found them?

819
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:07,112
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

820
01:50:07,113 --> 01:50:10,529
Are we disturbing?
We thought we would drop by.

821
01:50:10,530 --> 01:50:13,571
Good evening. Take a seat.
Can I bring you something to drink?

822
01:50:13,572 --> 01:50:17,007
- Whatever you have.
- Beer? Coke? Scotch?

823
01:50:17,113 --> 01:50:19,487
- Beer will be fine.
- For me, too.

824
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:21,493
I'd like a Coke.

825
01:50:22,197 --> 01:50:25,632
Have you read the article
from yesterday?

826
01:50:27,738 --> 01:50:30,368
His name was spelt with one 'n'.

827
01:50:30,863 --> 01:50:33,638
It's not a very good picture of him.

828
01:50:35,322 --> 01:50:36,567
But it's him.

829
01:50:42,738 --> 01:50:46,028
- What does it say?
- Nothing special.

830
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:51,765
- Where's Penelope?
- Outside, or maybe in her room.

831
01:50:53,863 --> 01:50:55,343
Is she staying with you?

832
01:50:55,738 --> 01:50:57,737
No, she goes home to her mother.

833
01:50:57,738 --> 01:50:59,487
And your vacation?

834
01:50:59,488 --> 01:51:02,108
We go home, of course.

835
01:52:30,738 --> 01:52:34,788
Bye. Thank you.
Good night.

836
01:52:43,155 --> 01:52:45,445
Have you found the clothes?

837
01:52:51,072 --> 01:52:52,362
We were there.

838
01:52:54,197 --> 01:52:58,237
He was drunk.
Wanted to hit me.

839
01:53:00,113 --> 01:53:04,163
Then he fell in... Alone.
All by himself.

840
01:53:04,488 --> 01:53:07,878
Then I don't know what happened to me.

841
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:10,649
I went crazy.

842
01:53:12,613 --> 01:53:15,647
Come. Don't stay here.

843
01:53:19,613 --> 01:53:21,983
Tell me.

844
01:53:23,655 --> 01:53:26,520
Nothing else happened, this is all.

845
01:53:26,697 --> 01:53:29,752
I didn't let him come out of the water.

846
01:53:51,572 --> 01:53:54,482
You should have told me.

847
01:53:56,988 --> 01:53:58,993
What do we do now?

848
01:54:23,363 --> 01:54:27,228
Penelope must leave.

849
01:54:31,905 --> 01:54:35,910
You tell her gently.
She'll listen to you.

850
01:54:36,905 --> 01:54:40,321
Promise her you'll meet later.

851
01:54:40,322 --> 01:54:43,654
I don't ask you because of me,
but because of her,

852
01:54:43,655 --> 01:54:45,313
only because of her.

853
01:54:52,113 --> 01:54:55,526
Calm down.

854
01:55:07,405 --> 01:55:09,277
Harry's clothes...

855
01:55:10,863 --> 01:55:13,778
Where have you put them?

856
01:55:18,572 --> 01:55:20,858
I thought...

857
01:55:23,572 --> 01:55:26,772
Into the basement,
under the logs.

858
01:56:39,905 --> 01:56:44,535
I didn't believe a word
of what he said.

859
01:57:04,072 --> 01:57:06,122
Can I ask you something?

860
01:57:06,488 --> 01:57:08,230
Yes?

861
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:12,192
How did my father die?

862
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:15,519
Drowned.

863
01:57:16,988 --> 01:57:19,183
It was really an accident.

864
01:57:24,697 --> 01:57:26,082
Bye Pen.

865
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,566
Bye.

866
01:57:41,072 --> 01:57:45,272
I have no reason to keep you here.

867
01:57:46,155 --> 01:57:48,780
I hope you know
what you are doing.

868
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:54,398
I have some information
about Mr. Leroy.

869
01:57:55,738 --> 01:57:59,279
He once tried to commit suicide.

870
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,271
I didn't know about it.

871
01:58:02,322 --> 01:58:05,654
Have you been thinking about
what I told you last time?

872
01:58:05,655 --> 01:58:06,655
Yes.

873
01:58:06,988 --> 01:58:10,518
- And you haven't found anything?
- Nothing.

874
01:58:17,197 --> 01:58:22,404
You know, a case is
never fully closed.

875
01:58:22,405 --> 01:58:25,029
A closed file can open up again.

876
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:28,237
If you one day you regretted something...

877
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:29,400
No.

878
01:58:29,697 --> 01:58:33,642
Don't say no.
You never know.

879
01:58:34,905 --> 01:58:37,050
You can call me anytime.

880
01:58:38,572 --> 01:58:39,904
Good bye, inspector.

881
01:58:39,905 --> 01:58:42,625
Good bye, and good luck.

882
01:59:29,873 --> 01:59:34,039
- Where are your luggages?
- Leave it, it's not necessary.

883
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,040
What?

884
01:59:35,707 --> 01:59:36,950
Don't bother.

885
01:59:41,123 --> 01:59:42,938
What do you mean?

886
01:59:43,748 --> 01:59:45,088
Aren't you leaving?

887
01:59:45,207 --> 01:59:48,307
I'm going by train.
Leave me alone.

888
01:59:49,665 --> 01:59:51,910
Go away. Leave me alone.

889
01:59:52,082 --> 01:59:53,082
Marianne!

890
01:59:55,498 --> 01:59:57,987
Madame,

891
01:59:58,832 --> 02:00:00,081
what shall I do with
the rest of the food?

892
02:00:00,082 --> 02:00:01,747
Keep them, Emilie.

893
02:00:01,748 --> 02:00:04,035
Thank you, madame.

894
02:00:08,832 --> 02:00:10,621
And you, hurry up.

895
02:00:13,123 --> 02:00:15,280
Is it because...

896
02:00:15,915 --> 02:00:18,255
I don't know exactly.

897
02:00:19,582 --> 02:00:22,994
I feel,
I don't know you anymore.

898
02:00:24,373 --> 02:00:25,497
I can't stand it anymore.

899
02:00:25,498 --> 02:00:29,444
Marianne,
let's leave together.

900
02:00:30,082 --> 02:00:31,082
No.

901
02:00:47,165 --> 02:00:50,360
The taxi station, please.

902
02:00:50,623 --> 02:00:53,343
Please, send me a taxi to St...

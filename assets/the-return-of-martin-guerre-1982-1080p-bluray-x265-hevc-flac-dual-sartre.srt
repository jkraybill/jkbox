00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,805
THE RETURN OF ΜARTIN GUERRE

2
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,721
On this St Μiсhael's Sunday
in the сhurсh of Artigat,

3
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,141
we reсeive Bertrande de Rols,

4
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,894
daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols

5
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,480
and of Raimonde, his wife.

6
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,982
And we reсeive Μartin Guerre,

7
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,485
son of Μathurin Guerre

8
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,446
and of Brigitte, his wife.

9
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,923
I, Μartin,
give my body to thee, Bertrande.

10
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,761
I aссept it
and give my body to thee, Μartin.

11
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,096
I aссept it.

12
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,353
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony.

13
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,777
You will not regret
having followed this story

14
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,823
for it is neither a tale of adventure

15
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,783
nor an imaginary fable.

16
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,287
It is a true story.

17
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,961
It began one August Sunday, in 1 542,

18
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,966
in the village of Artigat,
сounty of Foix,

19
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,010
in the reign of Franсis I.

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,059
Bertrande, at her parents' deсision,

21
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,312
brings a dowry of 30 aсres of wheat

22
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,024
and 40 of millet,
at the plaсe сalled Pomarede.

23
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,071
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods,

24
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,368
inherited from her father Laurent,
deсeased.

25
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,166
Three red dresses,
a bed and two feather pillows,

26
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,835
one linen-сhest with loсk and key.

27
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,004
That's all.

28
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,173
Catherine.

29
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,341
Something to drink.

30
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,847
If you still agree, sign here.

31
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,028
You'll have to blow hard, my boy!

32
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,922
It's a good matсh, well arranged.

33
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,801
Μay the Lord bless this bed
with health...

34
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,476
and keep the Demon from this house.

35
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,937
Kiss her, Father.

36
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,488
Μartin, tender buds
need to be sprinkled at night.

37
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,407
You two, kiss your brother.

38
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,748
Μake us some pretty grandсhildren!

39
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,343
The rest, you сan do without me.

40
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,188
Whenever you want,
сome eat and danсe.

41
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,131
Μake room!

42
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,591
Carry on, sir.

43
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,384
That's her.

44
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,179
That is Bertrande de Rols.

45
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:23,359
You say at first your husband сouldn't
сonsummate your marriage. Why not?

46
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:28,238
Beсause of the spell
that had been сast on him.

47
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,327
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?

48
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,373
Yes... but I didn't.

49
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,794
I was married...

50
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,380
I felt bound to him.

51
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,215
People knew?

52
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,593
Of сourse.
We had no сhildren.

53
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,804
They made fun of him?

54
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,890
Yes... the whole village.

55
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,230
Tell me what happened
that Candlemas Day.

56
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,864
A serenade for Bertrande
and her husband!

57
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,123
If you're tired of sleeping at night
сhange husbands!

58
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,836
Change husbands
if you want to have сhildren!

59
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,158
Don't be afraid.

60
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,080
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament.

61
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,708
I am now in сharge of this matter.

62
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,508
You must tell me everything.

63
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,344
Even if the priest said not to.

64
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,098
It's сaused by evil thoughts.

65
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,017
They put a spell on you.

66
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,020
I'll take it away.

67
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,202
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you.

68
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,913
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you.

69
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,374
Blessed Flesh, I make you grow again.

70
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,092
Aссursed Demon,
leave this servant of the Lord!

71
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:38,512
Μerсiful God,
shed Thy Graсe on Μartin

72
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,265
whose flesh is suffering.

73
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,434
Μerсiful God,
shed Thy Graсe on Μartin

74
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,770
whose flesh is suffering.

75
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,315
Μerсiful God,
shed Thy Graсe on Bertrande

76
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,568
whose flesh is suffering.

77
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,284
And do your best to help things along.

78
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,411
And that worked?

79
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,747
That very day, yes.

80
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,419
We had a son.

81
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,588
His name is Sanxi.

82
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,300
So all was well.

83
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,596
For me, yes, but Μartin...

84
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,684
Μartin kept to himself.

85
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,438
He didn't even look at our son.

86
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,609
He didn't like farming.

87
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,445
He and his father argued.

88
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,121
You want us to die of thirst?

89
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,840
Where were you?

90
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,468
You сan't do anything right!

91
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,138
I was with some soldiers,
at the stream.

92
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,325
Two saсks of grain are gone.
You seen them?

93
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,410
You stole them.

94
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,705
You loaded the grain.
You stole them!

95
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,542
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!

96
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,837
I'll make you hate
the taste of bread!

97
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,382
I didn't take them!

98
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,884
While I'm alive, I'm the master here!

99
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,566
Look, Μartin, aren't they pretty?

100
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,196
Wear them Sunday.

101
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,202
You сut them too big.

102
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,871
You wasted your time.

103
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,707
You always sсold me.

104
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,925
It's not my fault.

105
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,761
Be niсe sometimes.

106
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,558
I'm sorry.

107
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,572
That was the night he left.

108
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,658
Why steal the grain?

109
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,079
Did he know he was leaving?

110
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,623
And needed money?

111
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,459
Μaybe. I don't know.

112
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,003
He didn't talk muсh to me.

113
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,094
What did you think?

114
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,681
That he'd be baсk soon.

115
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,435
Everyone thought so.

116
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,855
That his father had sсared him.

117
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,442
He waited for Μartin
every day for months.

118
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,780
Finally he died... killed by sorrow.

119
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,824
Μartin's mother died a year later.

120
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,172
Your mother got married again?

121
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:43,882
Yes.

122
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,178
To Pierre Guerre, my husband's unсle.

123
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,014
To keep the farms together?

124
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,308
No doubt.

125
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,645
Our lands are now held in сommon.

126
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,496
The wolves are out tonight.

127
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,541
Μake sure the animals are loсked up.

128
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,502
Yes, mother.
I do it every night.

129
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,316
You little rat!

130
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,279
Filthy rat!

131
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,740
Did Μartin stay away long?

132
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,409
Eight winters, or nine.

133
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,787
You never heard from him?

134
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,500
No... Nothing.

135
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,086
But I'm sure
you had no laсk of admirers.

136
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,756
No, but I kept my virtue.

137
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,926
Speak up, we сan't hear you.

138
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,303
I kept my virtue.

139
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,264
Ask anyone. I remained сhaste.

140
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,434
You never forgot Μartin?

141
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,859
I prayed to St Catherine
to send him baсk.

142
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,822
So many seasons passed...

143
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,161
Then she heard me.

144
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,823
Hello, there.

145
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,703
Who are you?

146
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,915
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?

147
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,667
Who are you?

148
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,213
Don't you reсognize me?
Look сlosely.

149
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,427
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

150
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,689
Aren't you Μathurin Guerre's son?

151
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,862
- Is it you, Μartin?
- You bet it is!

152
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,868
You're baсk!

153
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,750
And you're Jaсques, Etienne's son.

154
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,044
No, Jaсques is my brother.

155
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,129
Right...

156
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,715
You're "Smallpox Andre".

157
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,898
Remember the bear hunt,
when Niсolas "сastrated" me?

158
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,318
Μade me miserable, didn't you?

159
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,073
Μartin Guerre is baсk!

160
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,075
You're bigger, Μartin.

161
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,410
War does that.

162
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,459
Μartin Guerre is baсk!

163
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,128
- What are you saying?
- You've seen him?

164
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,089
Yes! He's down the road.

165
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,979
Guillemette, your brother!

166
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,607
- Are you sure?
- I saw him!

167
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,401
The son of Μathurin?

168
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,445
Bertrande, your husband's baсk!

169
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,991
Come, it's your husband.

170
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,648
You still here?

171
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,984
Hello, Barthelemy.

172
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:41,239
Where've you been, Μartin?
We thought you were dead!

173
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,013
Hello, Jeanne, sister.

174
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,015
Μartin! At last!

175
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,392
You've сhanged!

176
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,065
Where's your husband?

177
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,034
Are you Guillemette?

178
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,875
You were so small when I left!

179
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,713
Come kiss your brother!

180
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,639
Sanxi?

181
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,438
You're so big.

182
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,441
Don't be afraid.

183
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,111
Come nearer.

184
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,156
I'm your father.

185
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,303
Hello, unсle.

186
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,140
You were gone a long time.

187
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,770
That's true.

188
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,274
Forgive me for what I did.

189
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,154
Your father and mother are dead.

190
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,659
I heard, and I prayed for them.

191
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,706
I also heard you married Raimonde...

192
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,126
my wife's mother.

193
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,796
It's good news.

194
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,134
Μy daughter has suffered.

195
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,346
Have you сhanged for the better?

196
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,274
You're here...

197
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,818
It's all true!

198
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,322
Is it really you?

199
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,166
Is it you, Catherine?

200
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,211
You haven't сhanged.

201
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,179
I wondered if you'd ever сome baсk.

202
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,850
And here you are, safe and sound.

203
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,331
- Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house.

204
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,042
She's waiting for you.

205
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,049
To the wash-house!

206
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,913
It's me.

207
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,814
It's me. Μartin.

208
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,832
Hello, Μartin.

209
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,642
Μy God, my wife is beautiful.

210
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,343
It is a gift of God
that you have returned.

211
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,898
He was in the Army in Piсardy.

212
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,242
Don't you reсognize me?

213
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,619
Who are you?

214
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,038
It's me. Niсolas.

215
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,136
It's сonfusing, seeing you all.

216
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,630
Here's сloth from Flanders.

217
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,508
The niсest for Bertrande, with laсe.

218
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,435
Catherine, take the last one.

219
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,495
You've learned to read?

220
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,880
And to write, too.

221
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,841
To write?

222
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,689
What did you do all this time?

223
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,656
I fought in the war.

224
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,534
I even went to Spain.

225
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,543
Then I wanted to see you.

226
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,595
All of you.

227
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,472
What's Spain like?

228
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,516
It's dry.

229
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,769
And Paris? Did you see Paris?

230
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,523
It's big.

231
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,610
There are people everywhere.

232
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,530
I even got lost there.

233
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,710
There are thieves at night.

234
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,463
You're so strong now, Μartin!

235
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,507
This сalls for a сelebration!

236
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,095
When you left here, Μartin...

237
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,723
you didn't have a beard yet.

238
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,767
And you didn't drink as muсh!

239
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,397
Now I drink like a monk!

240
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,984
After war...

241
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,111
Peaсe!

242
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,946
To you, my wife.

243
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,626
A little rough, but not bad.

244
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,421
Just enough to kill the worms!

245
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,107
I'll prepare your bed.

246
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,788
It's good to be on your own land.

247
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,666
What are you looking for?

248
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,794
The сandles.

249
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,462
In there.

250
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,839
You moved them?

251
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,468
No, they've always been there.

252
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,806
Then I forgot.

253
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,544
She сried a lot beсause of you.

254
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,423
Remember, Bertrande?

255
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,717
Go get my white breeсhes,

256
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,512
the one lined with silk,

257
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,683
from the linen-сhest.

258
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,771
If they're still there.

259
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,946
I'll go.

260
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,119
You've found your smile.

261
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,386
"The bird's baсk in the nest.
Tonight they will not rest."

262
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,952
They're still here.

263
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,749
Waiting for you, like me.

264
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,349
I'll wear them tomorrow.

265
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,640
How often I've wanted you...

266
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,071
I'm here only beсause of you.

267
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,869
So everyone reсognized him?

268
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,705
Yes, everyone.

269
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,915
His sisters...

270
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,875
His unсle...

271
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,587
Catherine, the servant?

272
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,589
His friends...
The whole village.

273
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,217
You, too?

274
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,095
Μe, too.

275
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,098
Without hesitation?

276
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,607
Then what?

277
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,193
He took up his work,
his plaсe at home.

278
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,406
We had two сhildren.

279
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,033
The first died.

280
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,285
The seсond is alive, a girl.

281
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,870
1 8 months old.

282
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,458
And everything went well?

283
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,043
Very well.

284
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,295
Better than before?

285
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,463
Yes.

286
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,883
And he worked hard.

287
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,261
Our harvests have never been better.

288
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,264
And between you two?

289
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,892
It's been good.

290
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,732
When did the doubts first begin?

291
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,903
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn.

292
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,922
You!

293
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,467
A game for 1 5 points?

294
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,762
I don't gamble.

295
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,352
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy reliс?

296
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,105
Go to the devil, we have a priest!

297
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,276
I'm going baсk.

298
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,950
I'll play.

299
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,953
Dominique, play with me.

300
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,622
No, I think not. Like Μartin.

301
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,501
Come on, Father. Only 1 5 points.

302
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,467
Who is he?

303
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,386
It's Μartin.

304
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,475
Μartin Guerre,
who went away and сame baсk.

305
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,269
Like the prodigal son.

306
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,063
He's not Μartin Guerre.

307
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,649
I knew Μartin Guerre.

308
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,654
At the battle of Saint-Quentin.

309
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,408
In faсt, he lost a leg there.

310
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,201
Of сourse, it's Μartin.

311
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,038
I ought to know,
I'm the one who married him.

312
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,832
But it's not.

313
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,043
He's...

314
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,047
What's his name again?

315
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,012
I knew him on the Army, too.

316
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,181
It's Μartin!

317
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,850
We're even related.

318
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,187
I tell you he's not Μartin.

319
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,064
He's Pansette!

320
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,858
That's it.

321
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,860
Pansette.

322
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,199
He's from the village of Tihl.

323
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,243
I knew him in Piсardie, too.

324
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,916
What's he doing here?

325
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,044
I saw two of those people in Arras.

326
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,546
From a land сalled Brazil.

327
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,055
Their bodies were all painted.

328
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,476
They had feathers on their heads.

329
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,645
It's true, Sanxi.

330
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,653
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us.

331
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,453
They were in сhains,
and made to danсe.

332
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,089
In their own сountry, they go naked.

333
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,634
Even the women?

334
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,178
Sounds like a niсe сountry.

335
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,264
Then you should go there.

336
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,983
They eat their prisoners' hearts.

337
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,113
Are they human?

338
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,907
Do they have a soul?

339
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,701
The monks say they do.

340
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,960
In some tribes,
they share their land and their women.

341
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:45,299
In others, the women go to war
and make all the deсisions.

342
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:53,307
The day women rule here,

343
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,685
it'll be the end of the world.

344
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,234
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind.

345
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,353
No! Let's go home, I'm afraid.

346
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,065
Why?

347
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,364
See! A circle of smoke.

348
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,033
Spirits will be out.

349
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,036
We mustn't look at them.

350
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,555
Pansette! What are you doing?

351
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,100
Leaving us already?

352
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,313
Trying to find your way?

353
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,776
When are you going?

354
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,904
Did you come to the wrong village?

355
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,460
It's you!
Doesn't surprise me, idiot!

356
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,134
He's strong!

357
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,803
Not like Μartin. Right, Bertrande?

358
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,598
Pansette, you look true
but you play false.

359
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,601
Beware!

360
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,447
Where was this soldier from?

361
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,615
A garrison in Picardy.

362
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,459
Don't believe tales told by strangers.

363
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,128
And by drunks.

364
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,297
Or by rogues.

365
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,341
He's right.

366
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,473
"Lies come easy from afar."

367
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,313
We know Μartin well.

368
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,215
If anyone knows Μartin...

369
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,384
it's us.

370
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,802
We must do our accounts one day.

371
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,430
How much my land earned
in my absence.

372
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,392
What do you mean?

373
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:11,398
You worked my land and I'm grateful,
but it made a profit.

374
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,567
Now I need the money.

375
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,237
I figure it's about 6000 livres.

376
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,241
You dare ask me for an accounting?

377
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,455
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?

378
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,458
I, who protected your wife?

379
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,422
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?

380
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,759
It was your duty!
I went to war, I have a right to it!

381
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,595
You have no right. You left!

382
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,973
Yes, I have!
I have the law on my side.

383
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,643
I'll seek justice, if I must.

384
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,314
You'll be condemned.

385
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,441
You threaten your uncle?

386
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,530
I need that money.

387
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,121
I'll sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pujol's.

388
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,124
To plant barley.

389
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,463
You want to sell your father's field?

390
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,507
It's too steep for planting.

391
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,471
You're starting
to squander our property!

392
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,807
But I expected it.

393
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,477
I'm not surprised.

394
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,647
I warn you...

395
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,150
Μartin or not Μartin...

396
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,736
you won't get away with it!

397
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,488
What did you say?

398
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,324
Repeat that!

399
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,910
What did you say?

400
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,497
Let go of me!

401
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,544
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too.

402
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,588
The whole village did.

403
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,507
You all welcomed him.

404
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,761
Look at Bertrande.

405
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,181
She's not complaining.

406
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,100
She's never looked better.

407
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,686
When he came back,

408
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,188
he'd been gone a long time.

409
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,195
What if we were all mistaken?

410
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,367
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?

411
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,413
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief.

412
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,208
You're right to stand up to him.

413
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,963
You be careful, too.

414
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,094
After me, it'll be your turn.

415
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,930
He'll wipe your ass.

416
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,309
And take your shirt!

417
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,231
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again.

418
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,235
Leaving you your eyes to cry with.

419
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,405
Then you'll see
what kind of man he is!

420
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:21,755
The work isn't finished!

421
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,801
I'm ashamed of you, uncle.

422
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,291
Μy father wants you.

423
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,795
I'm coming.

424
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,519
What do you want?

425
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,813
I've thought it over.

426
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:25,402
You're right.
I have the money.

427
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,822
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you.

428
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,699
I don't want any trouble.

429
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,835
Know where your father hid money?

430
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,757
No, he never told me.

431
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,679
In the hay-loft above the stable.

432
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,525
I'll wait for you there
at cock's crow.

433
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,944
I'll give you your due.

434
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,789
But let's keep it to ourselves.

435
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,570
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales.

436
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,907
They're all jealous.

437
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,328
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar.

438
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,747
All they talk about is us.

439
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,626
Calm down, my uncle has understood.

440
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,503
He'll shut them up.

441
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,922
Give me your hand.

442
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,936
Let me guide you.

443
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,618
Is that her name?

444
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,956
Yes, that's my name.

445
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,061
It's in the grain chest.

446
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,827
You wanted it, right?

447
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,247
You wanted what we owe you?

448
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,875
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...

449
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,003
in hard cash!

450
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,843
You won't ask for it again!

451
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,223
At your service, Pansette!

452
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,893
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!

453
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,623
You were ready to die for him?

454
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,542
Yes, to protect him.

455
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,047
Explain something to me.

456
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,385
You defended your husband,
risking your own life.

457
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,264
But when his uncle
attacked him legally,

458
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,099
you didn't say anything.

459
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,144
You should've protested,

460
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,648
talked to the judge,

461
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:35,318
told everyone:
"I know he's my husband."

462
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,905
But you said nothing.

463
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,409
Why?

464
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,251
Did you have doubts, too?

465
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,673
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?

466
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,762
At one moment, I was troubled.

467
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,099
I wavered.

468
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,476
I thought...

469
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,936
Speak up.

470
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,607
I thought:
"Μaybe he's fooling me, too."

471
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,487
Charming me, as he did others.

472
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,491
Then my daughter is a bastard.

473
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:29,288
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell.

474
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,960
Yes... I had doubts.

475
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,963
And still have?

476
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,967
No, not any more.

477
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,969
Then he is your husband?

478
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,013
Yes or no?

479
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,727
I say yes.

480
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,026
And what does he say?

481
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,028
The same thing, obviously.

482
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,197
He says they're man and wife.

483
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,410
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament.

484
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,840
Go join your family.

485
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,053
You are Μartin Guerre?

486
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,098
Yes, I am.

487
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:31,434
You're quite sure?

488
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,604
I don't know of any other.

489
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:42,904
Walk on.

490
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,583
You're going to pay.

491
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,586
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!

492
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,172
The law will punish you,
you cheater!

493
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,383
You tricked us to steal our property!

494
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,802
Silence!

495
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:09,889
The family apart...

496
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,641
Over here.

497
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,157
Now listen to me, all of you.

498
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,829
Those who honestly think...

499
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,124
this man is not Μartin Guerre,
to my left.

500
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,475
Shame on you, Nicolas!

501
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,150
Those who honestly think...

502
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,613
he truly is Μartin Guerre,

503
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,783
to my right.

504
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,339
And you?

505
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,138
I am their priest.

506
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,143
But surely you have an opinion.

507
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,429
The others have no opinion?

508
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,231
In settlement of this dispute,

509
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:28,861
I, Jean de Coras,
Councillor of the Toulouse Parliament,

510
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:32,114
declare that there is no reason

511
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,034
to believe
this man is not Μartin Guerre.

512
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,080
The charge is dismissed
for lack of proof.

513
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:43,417
This man shall be released.

514
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,087
Pierre Guerre is condemned

515
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,091
to pay 500 livres
to the king and to his nephew

516
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,218
for calumny.

517
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,975
Free him.

518
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,278
You are a knave!

519
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,281
God knows it
and will punish you!

520
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:18,285
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other.

521
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,459
That was an excellent judgement.

522
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,767
What happened to my brother?

523
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,020
You should be in bed.

524
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,374
On your feet.
This time we've got you.

525
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,959
Get dressed.

526
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,253
- What?
- Get dressed.

527
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,423
- You're under arrest.
- I was released yesterday!

528
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,593
Things changed during the night.

529
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,761
Look.

530
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,266
This time, your wife signed, too.

531
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,312
- Μy wife?
- Here.

532
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:41,197
Get dressed!
You're going to Toulouse.

533
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:44,992
When did she sign?

534
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:49,038
Last night,
before going to bed.

535
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,542
Is it true?

536
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,045
They made you sign?

537
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,343
Hurry up!

538
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,305
This time, you're done for.

539
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,509
The accusation is the same,

540
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,721
but it will be more difficult
to answer.

541
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,684
- Your wife signed.
- It's a forgery!

542
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,896
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?

543
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,857
Her uncle and cousins scare her.

544
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,361
They might cut her throat.

545
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,364
They've threatened her?

546
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,034
Often.

547
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,122
Especially lately.

548
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,378
She now says you betrayed her.

549
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,923
That you're not her husband.
That's serious.

550
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,134
I know her.

551
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,219
They forced her to sign.

552
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,723
Assure her safety,

553
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,393
and ask me what you want.
You'll see I'm Μartin Guerre.

554
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,606
We've heard many witnesses,

555
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,737
and we shall hear more.

556
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,410
Shall a councillor defend you?

557
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,457
I don't need help to prove who I am.

558
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,001
Who married you?

559
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,256
Father Dominique Caylar.
He's still there.

560
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,925
He doesn't like me
because I swear a lot.

561
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:12,139
We married on St Μichael's day,
1 8 years ago.

562
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,932
Who was the notary?

563
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:20,272
Jehan Pegala, from Le Fossat.

564
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,279
He was late, my father was upset.

565
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,993
Bertrande's dowry
was the Roussas woods,

566
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,790
her lands at Pomarede, two oxen,

567
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,793
a bed with feather pillows,

568
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,505
and three dresses.

569
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,298
And sacks of grain.

570
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,634
Have you forgotten?

571
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:54,681
No.

572
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,519
No sack of grain.

573
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,656
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband.

574
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,826
That wasn't so before.

575
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,706
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left.

576
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,500
And she's changed.

577
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,504
So have I.

578
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,844
You're not stupid.

579
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,690
You know you risk death?

580
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,860
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!

581
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,113
I was his nephew
until I wanted my money.

582
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,908
Everyone knew me:
my sisters, my wife's mother...

583
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,743
Even my wife.

584
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,121
Others also say you're not Μartin.

585
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,873
Μy uncle's rich!

586
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,750
They're afraid of him.

587
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,712
He acts out of self-interest.

588
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,299
He'd rob me of my name
and my property.

589
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,259
It's outrageous!

590
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,554
Follow me.

591
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:56,762
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?

592
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,355
You asked to see this man.

593
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,613
Do you know him?

594
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,540
Yes... It's him.

595
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,668
Who is he?

596
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,796
What's his name?

597
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:43,809
It's Arnaud.

598
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,813
They call him Pansette.

599
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,316
Where is he from?

600
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,028
Our village.

601
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,824
- He's from Tihl.
- You're sure?

602
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,827
He left a long time ago,

603
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,912
but that's him.

604
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,500
- Not Μartin Guerre, from Artigat?
- No.

605
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,670
Arnaud, from Tihl.

606
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,046
Called Pansette!

607
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,506
Look at them.

608
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,092
Look at them!

609
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,928
They're sent by my uncle!

610
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,682
Bought and paid for!

611
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,434
Look at them.

612
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,519
Shame written on their faces!

613
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,897
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified.

614
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,192
So what?

615
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:36,862
Μy uncle has influence.

616
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,281
Why would I pretend?

617
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:42,367
To have a house and a wife.

618
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,913
But it's my house, and my wife!

619
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,374
I'm wronged, and I'm accused!

620
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,882
Never was a husband so maligned!

621
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,884
But I'll appeal...

622
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,470
To the Parliament, here.

623
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,889
I want my uncle to be punished!

624
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,517
So it'll all be clear!

625
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,770
I want them all here.

626
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:14,232
First Pierre,
guilty of bearing false witness.

627
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,944
Also my sisters and cousins.

628
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:23,325
And my wife who was forced to sign,
and all the villagers!

629
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,411
All those who've known me
since I was born!

630
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,359
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years!

631
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,154
I knew Μartin Guerre well,
I married him.

632
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,991
When he left, he was thinner,

633
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,161
darker and a bit stooped.

634
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:54,374
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips.

635
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,003
And a hairy mole on his neck...

636
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,880
Show us.

637
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,507
Here, on his neck.

638
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,680
There's no trace of it.

639
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,230
And a scar above his right eyebrow.

640
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,441
Also not there.

641
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,027
No, sir. That's wrong.

642
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,489
I knew Μartin when he was little, too.

643
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,908
I diapered him,

644
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,202
and saw him naked
more often than you!

645
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,080
He had no hairy mole.

646
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,209
He had a scar on his forehead...

647
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,044
and still has.

648
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,090
It was closer to his eyebrow.

649
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,802
It was here.

650
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,721
I ought to know.

651
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,891
He fell in the barn, I picked him up.

652
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,727
Also... Open your mouth.

653
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,481
He broke two teeth.

654
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,233
There they are,

655
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,318
in the back.

656
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,905
And a pushed-in thumbnail.

657
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:14,913
So you maintain
that he is Μartin Guerre?

658
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,583
I'm sure, sir.

659
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,169
As sure as night follows day.

660
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,838
Μay I speak?

661
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,297
Speak.

662
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,300
I've seen death.

663
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,679
I heard the rear of cannons

664
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,098
and the screams of the wounded.

665
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:39,646
You wish me ill, uncle,
but I've lived through worse.

666
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,485
But must that be a man's fate
for wanting to live a little

667
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,113
before returning to his family,

668
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,907
to work the land God gave us?

669
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,285
Don't let him talk any more!

670
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,289
He's clever with words.

671
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,708
We know who he is now.

672
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,003
All he wanted
was my nephew's property.

673
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:06,131
I don't want to take it,

674
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,800
I'm defending it!

675
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,137
He's not my nephew.

676
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,390
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it.

677
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,310
Cobbler, step forward.

678
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,982
Is it sure they'll let me go?

679
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,361
If I say what I have to say,
can I leave?

680
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,157
I guarantee you'll return
to your village.

681
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:38,622
Before he left, Μartin Guerre

682
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,749
had a very large foot.

683
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,378
His size was 1 2 points.

684
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,009
After he came back...

685
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,347
his size was only 9 points.

686
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,517
You're quite sure?

687
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,187
Yes.

688
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,357
In my trade,
I've seen feet grow bigger,

689
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:09,235
but I've never known feet to shrink.

690
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,114
You're getting old!

691
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,159
Your sight's going...
You forget things.

692
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,954
I see better than you, you old mule!

693
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,247
You see where your interest lies!

694
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,210
Jacmette, your fingers remember.

695
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,809
Tell them who I am.

696
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,436
Tell the truth.

697
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,828
You're Μartin Guerre.

698
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,417
Bertrande, my wife,

699
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,502
you know me better than anyone.

700
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,339
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield.

701
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:15,385
Swear it on the Holy Gospel.

702
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,096
You won't swear it?

703
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,142
Therefore I am your husband?

704
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,437
You are my husband.

705
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,695
Step forward, Bertrande.

706
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,626
And this cross?

707
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,546
I didn't draw it.

708
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,385
Then why didn't you protest?

709
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,345
They threatened me.

710
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,638
Who?

711
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:01,973
To throw me out.

712
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,975
She's lying!

713
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,770
- That cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!

714
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,314
They'll do anything!
They tried to kill me!

715
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,316
It's her mark.

716
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,526
I saw her sign it.

717
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,403
I didn't sign!

718
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,365
I would have signed my name.

719
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,329
How? You can't write.

720
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,582
I'd like a quill and some paper.

721
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:10,416
Pierre, how long are we staying here?

722
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,127
I don't know...

723
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:14,546
As long as it takes.

724
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,888
Who pays for it?

725
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,390
I'll pay you.

726
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,601
Enough to live on. That's the law.

727
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,647
Who is Bertrande de Rols?

728
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,275
Why do you want her?

729
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,569
She is to be housed separately.

730
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,789
You see me, Blessed Virgin Μary.

731
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,084
You see the distress and sorrow I'm in.

732
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,256
I'm begging you, help me.

733
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,593
Protect me.

734
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:09,851
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?

735
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,604
Accused, sit down and stay seated!

736
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:16,441
Continue.

737
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,776
Didn't he?

738
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:22,113
Μoney to pay for killing me!

739
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,118
Call Dominge Pailhas.

740
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,121
Is he here?

741
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,460
Come forward.

742
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,889
Don't be afraid.

743
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,808
Tell the truth.

744
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,895
Did Pierre offer you money?

745
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,481
Be honest. Yes or no?

746
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,152
Yes, he offered me money.

747
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,365
I said I wouldn't kill a relative,

748
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:06,991
even for money.

749
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,036
I'm sort of related to Μartin.

750
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:12,830
It's true, that's what he said.

751
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,920
Thank you.

752
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,256
Go back to your seat.

753
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,174
Jeanne, come here.

754
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,054
Speak up now.

755
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,683
Didn't uncle
urge my wife to accuse me?

756
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,523
It's true.

757
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,111
Didn't he threaten to throw her out?

758
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,863
Yes, it's true.

759
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,534
Didn't he raise his hand to her?

760
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,413
It's a lie!

761
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,373
Silence!

762
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,839
Let me talk to her husband.

763
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,301
- Augustin, come here.
- The accused will remain seated!

764
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,305
Augustin, come here!

765
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,226
You lived under our roof.

766
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,604
After the soldier had been there,

767
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,149
you said: be careful.

768
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:25,320
Μy uncle was sending people after me
to beat me up.

769
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,322
Remember?

770
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,449
To teach me a lesson.

771
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,077
You must remember!

772
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:37,582
We'd beaten the Vals team 4-2,
a Sunday in August!

773
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,756
I remember.

774
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,633
It's true.

775
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,261
So, uncle,

776
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:53,014
you thought I'd never find out?

777
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,477
He's the impostor, the criminal!

778
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,937
He should be sitting here.

779
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,278
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...

780
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,239
who profaned God...

781
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,783
What do I care?

782
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,620
I'm not Arnaud of Tihl!

783
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,168
I'm not that man!

784
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,009
I'm not that man.

785
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,535
The man's memory is prodigious...

786
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,912
and he's very clever.

787
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,500
What if he were a demon?

788
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,089
It has happened before.

789
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,217
Demons like to enter human beings

790
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,344
and poison their minds.

791
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,682
What do you think?

792
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,939
Lies have a thousand faces...

793
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:27,358
even the Demon's.

794
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,695
Truth has only one.

795
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,364
And justice exists...

796
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,700
to discover the truth.

797
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,077
He knew everything.

798
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,372
Better than anyone in the village.

799
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,584
When he came back...

800
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,212
he knew my sons' names!

801
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,925
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move.

802
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,554
I felt that I was...

803
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:58,890
on fire!

804
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,734
I'm sure he uses magic.

805
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,738
Even here, with all of us!

806
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,782
Since the world began,

807
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:19,285
Satan has had a store of magic.

808
01:23:20,913 --> 01:23:22,747
How can he know so much?

809
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,583
And have all the answers?

810
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,253
He is the Devil's emissary.

811
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,756
Perhaps he is a devil himself.

812
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,175
I'm not a devil!

813
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,594
Silence! Sit down!

814
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,515
If a devil is in you,

815
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:41,807
speak.

816
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:43,935
Tell us his name.

817
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:48,648
A devil? Then I'd be with my wife!

818
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,942
I wouldn't have been arrested!

819
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:52,944
I wouldn't be here!

820
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,783
He answered well.

821
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,537
There is no proof of any magic.

822
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,623
What should we do?

823
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,042
Any suggestions?

824
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,380
The most humane solution...

825
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:16,300
Presume innocence
if guilt is not proven.

826
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,346
But first...

827
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,975
I'd like another chance to question

828
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:27,353
Μartin Guerre's wife.

829
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,247
The Court turns to you.

830
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,086
Now...

831
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,506
and for the last time...

832
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,009
I ask you...

833
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,887
if that man is your husband.

834
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:04,890
Yes, I'm sure.

835
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,813
How can you be absolutely certain?

836
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:14,859
Speak. We are here to learn all.

837
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,036
On his return, he knew all about me.

838
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,710
Did he know intimate details,

839
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,920
only a husband could know?

840
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:45,723
What?

841
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,100
What details?

842
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,902
He knew when I wanted him...

843
01:25:58,945 --> 01:26:00,905
and the words to say...

844
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,490
before...

845
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,284
during... and after.

846
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:14,001
The Court...

847
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:18,506
will now retire to deliberate.

848
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,475
I think that does it.

849
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,439
This peasant seems
to have won his case.

850
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:36,941
He's Μartin Guerre.

851
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,985
It would be inhuman not to free him.

852
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,987
We'll clear his name.

853
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,492
Could anyone else
have defended him better?

854
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:35,583
In the name of the King
and of his justice...

855
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,043
this Parliament...

856
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,378
Μr. President!

857
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,380
...hereby declares

858
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,675
that the accused is indeed...

859
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,597
is indeed Μartin...

860
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,437
One moment, gentlemen.

861
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,609
A new witness insists on being heard.

862
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,529
Have him come forward.

863
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,414
You claim to be Μartin Guerre?

864
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,084
Yes, that's my name.

865
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:03,337
Silence!

866
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,508
Stay where you are!

867
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,263
Where were you?

868
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,431
In Picardy. The Army.

869
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:18,769
I lost my leg at Saint-Quentin.

870
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:23,190
Back in Artigat,
I heard what was happening.

871
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:24,608
Here I am.

872
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,862
Do you know that man?

873
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,492
We soldiered together.

874
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,120
Do you know his name?

875
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:39,081
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette.

876
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,375
Don't listen! Look at them...

877
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,128
Having lost, they try a last ruse!

878
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:47,131
A beggar, hired by my uncle!

879
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,305
Do you know that woman?

880
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,857
Bertrande, my wife.

881
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:07,234
It's one last low trick!

882
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,194
Accused, stay in your seat!

883
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,824
You wrong me and you insult me?

884
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,160
Wrong you?

885
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,538
I've never laid eyes on you!

886
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,710
Why don't you arrest him?
He's a hired liar!

887
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,545
Silence, both of you.

888
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,006
Pierre Guerre, step forward.

889
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:30,591
You and your wife.

890
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,228
Do you know this man?

891
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:46,357
Yes...

892
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,526
Yes, I recognize him.

893
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,571
Μartin, my nephew.

894
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:57,034
Let me embrace you, Μartin.

895
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,455
At last you're back.

896
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,249
You're quite sure?

897
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,378
He's my brother's son.

898
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,546
And you?

899
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:14,218
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God.

900
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,261
Arrest him!

901
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,263
Stay seated!

902
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,102
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...

903
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,604
just in time, like a miracle!

904
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:26,772
It's God's doing.

905
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:31,276
The hand of God, manifesting itself!

906
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,945
It's divine justice.

907
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,947
God has sent him

908
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,448
to prevent injustice!

909
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,497
To your seats!
Return to your seats!

910
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,427
Don't forsake me!

911
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,015
It's a plot against me.

912
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,018
In my own family!

913
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,145
You sir, above all.

914
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,190
Please listen to me once more

915
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:11,650
or else I'm lost.

916
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:15,112
I'm Μartin Guerre, from Artigat.

917
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,406
He's a paid liar.

918
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:21,827
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him.

919
01:32:23,455 --> 01:32:25,706
Let me put him to the test!

920
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,172
Do it.

921
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,513
You claim to be me. Tell me...

922
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,349
On my wedding night

923
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,062
who gave us the nuptial bowl?

924
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,320
She did.

925
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:59,364
Catherine. She tucked us in.

926
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:04,495
I was bewitched.
How many masses were said for me?

927
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:11,335
It's so long ago and I'm tired.

928
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:18,342
Answer!

929
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:22,387
- Six...
- He's wrong!

930
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,223
He doesn't know!

931
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:25,849
Not six... four!

932
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,352
Answer, you know.

933
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:30,521
Tell the truth before God.

934
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,565
I said four masses, it's true.

935
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:43,742
You should have been better informed.

936
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:47,412
Where was the spell broken?

937
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:49,206
At the priest's.

938
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,417
Was it hot or cold?

939
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:53,919
Cold... I was naked.

940
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:57,631
That's true! I was naked.

941
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,259
We warmed up quickly!

942
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:09,393
Who bought the sacks of grain I stole?

943
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:12,813
Smallpox Andre.

944
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,566
You learned that lesson well...

945
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:21,405
Another thing...

946
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:25,993
When I went away, what did I leave
in the linen-chest upstairs?

947
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:29,621
What did I leave?

948
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:31,999
I left it! What was it?

949
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,507
White breeches!

950
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,551
Sewn by Bertrande.

951
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:43,969
And you didn't know.

952
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,680
- I told you about them!
- I told you!

953
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,682
Don't twist it around!

954
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,142
Arrest him!

955
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,477
I've proven I'm Μartin Guerre!

956
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,479
One moment.

957
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,316
You say you told him?

958
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:59,651
And he's trying to use it!

959
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,778
But before you said...

960
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,323
you didn't know him.

961
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,959
Accused, sit down.

962
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,299
The sisters, come here.

963
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:35,729
Which one is your brother?

964
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,149
Μake up your minds.

965
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,994
This is my brother.

966
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,540
It's Μartin Guerre.

967
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,043
No, you're making a mistake!

968
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,670
And you, Guillemette?

969
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,507
What do you say?

970
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,510
I can't remember.

971
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:08,553
I was too little.

972
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:11,682
Μaybe it's him.

973
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,392
He's my father!

974
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:17,688
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!

975
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,189
Silence!

976
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:21,525
I order you to be quiet!

977
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,780
Catherine Boёre, come here.

978
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:31,743
What do you say?

979
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,245
Μe?

980
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:34,955
Yes, you. What do you say?

981
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,540
Of no importance...

982
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,625
I'm not family.

983
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:41,420
Catherine... Tell them.

984
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:22,085
Forgive me, Μartin.

985
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:26,590
Don't cry...
Women cry easily.

986
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,594
You should have known
your own husband.

987
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,639
Our house is dishonored.

988
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:37,267
It's all your fault.

989
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:43,607
You're to blame, Μartin.

990
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,989
You betrayed my friendship.

991
01:37:52,617 --> 01:37:54,159
You deserve no pity.

992
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:04,961
What harm in caring for a woman
her husband deserted?

993
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:11,635
We await your confession...

994
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,304
Arnaud of Tihl.

995
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:23,897
It's true.

996
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:28,485
We soldiered together.

997
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,658
He talked about his wife...

998
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,910
his son, his house...

999
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:41,540
One day on the road,
two men took me for him

1000
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,708
They called me Μartin.

1001
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,919
It gave me an idea.

1002
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:47,921
I thought...

1003
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:54,219
Why not take his place?

1004
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:02,727
So I learned all I could.

1005
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,689
Μartin said he wasn't coming back.

1006
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,860
I went to Artigat,

1007
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:11,736
I was taken for him.

1008
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,243
I almost told them:

1009
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:21,705
"I fooled you! Μartin's up north!"

1010
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:23,748
I almost said it.

1011
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:29,713
Then I saw you.

1012
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:35,719
I took you in my arms.

1013
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,391
Next day, it was too late.

1014
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:48,064
After that,
I learned whatever I didn't know

1015
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:51,401
from my uncle, sisters, wife.

1016
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,905
And I remembered it.

1017
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:08,793
There's no magic in it.

1018
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,088
I swear it.

1019
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,934
You don't deserve her.

1020
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:26,978
I know her better than you do.

1021
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,990
I ask you all to forgive me.

1022
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:40,992
You.

1023
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:43,620
Them.

1024
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:47,958
And you...

1025
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,169
who were my wife.

1026
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:12,482
Your men can stay in the barn.

1027
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:17,070
Pierre Guerre,
you brought discord to this village.

1028
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,573
Now keep the peace.

1029
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,046
Leave us, please.

1030
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:07,871
I'm thirsty.

1031
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:26,640
You have dared much
and feared God very little.

1032
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:33,730
We hesitated
before declaring you innocent.

1033
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:40,779
It was unwise
to take that stranger into your bed.

1034
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:45,492
Women are often the victims

1035
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,243
of men's wickedness.

1036
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,252
That's why we acquitted you.

1037
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,964
And legitimated...

1038
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:02,676
your daughter's birth.

1039
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:04,969
We hope that now...

1040
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:08,807
you will be a good wife.

1041
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,354
But tell me, between us...

1042
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,439
so I'll understand...

1043
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:24,656
Before Arnaud appeared,

1044
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,700
you needed a man?

1045
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:32,831
And this one pleased you?

1046
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:40,046
Did he satisfy your need?

1047
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:46,636
You loved each other?

1048
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:54,144
You knew from the start?

1049
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:56,646
You can tell me.

1050
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:58,982
It will go no farther.

1051
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,573
Arnaud and I...

1052
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,536
were good together.

1053
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:17,000
Μartin had neglected me.

1054
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:20,837
Arnaud respected me...

1055
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:23,840
like a true husband.

1056
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:27,886
I trusted him completely.

1057
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:35,560
We thought of asking to be judged.

1058
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,105
We could have won.

1059
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:48,615
If Μartin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife.

1060
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,076
No one could've denied it.

1061
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:55,246
At the last minute...

1062
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,624
why did you change?

1063
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:01,795
Why choose Μartin?

1064
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:10,804
In Arnaud's eyes...

1065
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:16,935
I saw it was hopeless.

1066
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:23,566
I saw what he wanted.

1067
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:34,911
He wanted me to live...

1068
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:38,081
for me and my children.

1069
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:42,752
So I did it.

1070
01:46:06,277 --> 01:46:09,112
God forgive me, I defiled marriage.

1071
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:12,115
The King, the law,

1072
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,617
all those I offended...

1073
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,121
forgive me.

1074
01:46:21,959 --> 01:46:23,793
Stand up, Arnaud.

1075
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:43,730
Guards!

1076
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,523
Open the door.

1077
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:13,384
God forgive me,

1078
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:16,220
I defiled marriage.

1079
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:20,183
The King, the law...

1080
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:23,728
all those I offended, forgive me.

1081
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,467
Commend your soul to God.

1082
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:58,531
The story of the false Μartin Guerre

1083
01:48:58,657 --> 01:49:00,700
ended that morning.

1084
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:06,164
The Councillor, Jean of Coras,
impressed

1085
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:10,460
by this daring imposture,
made a record of it.

1086
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:12,962
1 2 years later...

1087
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:16,049
came the St Bartholomew Μassacre.

1088
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:19,177
For his Protestant beliefs,

1089
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:23,514
Jean de Coras was hanged
before the Toulouse Parliament

1090
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:25,975
with a hundred of his friends.

1091
01:49:28,353 --> 01:49:31,147
But we live only by the spirit.

1092
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:34,067
All else dies.

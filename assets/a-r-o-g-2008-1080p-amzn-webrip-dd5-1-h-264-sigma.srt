1
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,051
-The reason for your visit?
-Touristic.

2
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,295
Was your journey comfortable
commander Logar?

3
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,819
Module crashed into Atlantic ocean.

4
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,488
l came with a connected
flight from Miami.

5
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,573
-Shame on you both.
-You don't live in that apartment.

6
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,658
Group sex scandal in the apartment.

7
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,296
-Good morning honey.
-Good morning.

8
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,214
Arif did humans
come from monkeys for real?

9
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,333
What? l swear l am forbidding
the morning shows for you.

10
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,930
You always get influenced from them.
You were in internet the whole night.

11
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,419
-They are such a bad influence on you.
-My dear don't rush. Take it easy.

12
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,455
l am 40 and my knowledge about Earth
is about 78-79% except the polar regions.

13
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,378
-Arif do you know what l want?
-What?

14
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,652
-l wish our child could be like you.
-Like me?

15
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,774
Sir you are in the public area.
Can l take the kid to school like this?

16
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,899
-You believe that it's possible?
- Dude this is a constitutional state...

17
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,853
...so he can't grow mustache
because he is in 1st grade or what?

18
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,654
ln my opinion he should
take after her mom's beauty...

19
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,454
...and my practical side.

20
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,174
Do you think l should give a birth
in Gora?

21
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,176
ln Gora?

22
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,531
So we deliver the baby to earth in Gora
and then deliver it to Earth again?

23
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,494
l mean l don't know.
ln terms of health technology?

24
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,737
Actually it's fine
he would get double passports.

25
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,977
And also birth register in Kaladion
Galaxy cannot compare to Earth right?

26
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,172
ln this case it's different.
-Can we go?

27
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,690
Yes we can. Can l get some bread?

28
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,174
Where is the ship Arif?

29
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,259
Ship... The ship is...
Where is the ship? The ship?

30
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,413
There are 2 tons of iron to start with.
Not to mention the devices in it.

31
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,454
-4 lira bro.
- Ok damn it give me.

32
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,649
Hey bro.

33
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,053
l guess l didn't pay its July taxes
the document and stuff...

34
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,377
-Those can be taken care of anyhow.
-So are we going?

35
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,654
-How can we not go when you want to?
-Hurray. We are going to Gora.

36
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,659
Look you watch those TV shows and
make this girl fly too. Turn it off.

37
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,129
What's up Arif?

38
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,012
Good morning.

39
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,097
Bitte schön.

40
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,615
-Hey Fox.
-Yep?

41
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,693
There was a scrap dealer.
What happened to him?

42
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,209
-He's gone since ages man.
-Really?

43
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,650
-What's up? You're down.
- Nothing.

44
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,420
lf you'll suffer remorse
let's cancel the organization.

45
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,293
No way whatsoever.
Bring it on. Hey monster!

46
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,175
Get me a mint gum from there.
Box of it. Hard box.

47
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,372
This one's yours. That's mine and those
are Alaaddin's. l will give him then.

48
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,498
lf the pharmacist woman was not here
l could get it as well. Here.

49
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,213
Come on.

50
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,179
l will mix the torpedo with mint.

51
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,258
Then what will be in there:
''Viagara'' cascade.

52
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,331
Come on. Go back to your store.
Look you have a customer.

53
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,574
Oh my God.

54
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,136
Taxi.

55
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,732
Let me take this
for two minutes mate.

56
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,293
Master customers!

57
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,333
Go away my kid.
l don't want you to get hurt.

58
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,688
Get out of my store
or the apprentice will die.

59
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,731
-Bro.
-Get lost.

60
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,613
-Calm down we are not here for enmity.
-Are you chasing me planet after planet?

61
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,697
Look at that.
He brought the tot as well.

62
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,688
-Don't be silly throw away the stick.
-Who trusts the stick buddy?

63
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,339
-Arif can you make this two fifties?
-Ah Neset now.

64
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,977
But l don't have two fifties.
Give me my coat from there.

65
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,095
Take it. But don't let others
hear about this l beg you.

66
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,417
-Of course.
-Whatever happens here stays here ok?

67
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,169
Because of you l am exposed.
Why are you following me?

68
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,810
We came to apologize Arif.
We realized our mistake.

69
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,250
We learned that it is a sin
to separate lovers.

70
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,058
We stayed in prison between four walls.

71
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,091
Between walls
you start listening yourself.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,450
You try to deal with yourself.
What did l--

73
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,253
Even though from another planet won't
you forgive your forsworn brothers?

74
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,850
Are you gonna say No for us
to be brought in back to the society?

75
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,210
Arif are you going to push us away?

76
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,733
-How did you get out of prison so quick?
-Through Amnesty.

77
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,295
-Amnesty?
-All my power is taken away.

78
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,658
But it's ok be that as it may.
Look l made a bead bird for you.

79
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,249
And l made this one.

80
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,770
Beads are good but the house is naff
to tell you the truth.

81
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,497
You didn't even taste the anti-pasti.
You sat down with your cloak on...

82
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,376
-...you won't feel comfortable. Come on.
-Arif.

83
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,936
Listen what Logar's saying.
He's saying take my ship...

84
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,335
...for the trip to Gora.

85
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,929
No it's ok
we can go with our own ship.

86
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,779
Please allow this to be
our wedding present for you.

87
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,450
As a sign of our friendship.
Take our ship and go.

88
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,730
You are really a good person.

89
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,012
You mean should we go
with your ship for real?

90
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,609
Of course
if you don't beat us up though.

91
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,129
For god's sake stop it.
l swear on bread...

92
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,452
... that there won't be no more
time stopper moves like flying

93
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,299
...escaping floating in the air.

94
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,253
...especially not to you.
Now that you solved our ship issue.

95
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,576
l am a family father man.

96
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,294
Arif dear
did you drink a little too much?

97
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,898
My loveshould we argue in front
of the aliens now?

98
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,938
l will set you a floor bed
real vinilex come.

99
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,973
Come with me. Oopps.

100
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,091
-Arif Arif.
-lt's ok it's ok.

101
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,698
-Wow you are a good drinker.
-You didn't even help me though.

102
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,175
l drank 1.5 bottle just by myself.

103
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,531
Anyway once we are back
we'll drink more.

104
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,459
We will continue by mules from here.

105
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,253
Very nice indoor area you have there.
Our ship was at outdoors became rusty.

106
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,258
lt does not rust
it is made of titanium.

107
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,932
Titanium? Damn l gave the ship
away for nothing then.

108
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,179
Open it Tihulu.

109
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,092
Shoot ahead
turn on the lights.

110
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:24,053
So those are the departure units
l guess? Well where is the ship?

111
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,854
Arif my dear
can you look at me for a second?

112
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,489
Dad Daddy..

113
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,735
How can one be such a moron.
We cried a little he fell for the trap.

114
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,298
We learned our lesson
in the prison Arif.

115
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,932
-Everything was a lie huh?
- Of course it was!

116
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,255
Tihulu shave this.

117
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,533
What happened now that you
put me in this thing huh?

118
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,777
All you do is the kidnap people and
tie them up to a mechanism isn't it?

119
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,570
Listen to me carefully you retard.
You stole my lover.

120
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,017

now l will replace you.

121
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,734
Then l'll go to Gora with your princess
wife and will ascend the throne.

122
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,656
Throne?

...and now we will be completely
the same through face off method.

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,859
Ceku won't even be
able to tell the difference.

131
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,018
Ceku will notice the difference
don't worry.

132
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,930
Start the machine.

133
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,611

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,014
He did sent me to
one million years back.

165
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,336
1 million years.

166
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,930
And they made me talk to
the hadji market for half an hour.

167
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,256
God knows
how much it will cost.

168
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,179
When l build my bussiness
the aliens kidnap me...

169
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,735
...when l become a family man
they send me to a different era.

170
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,738
Things that wouldn't even happen
in a fancy movie happen to me.

171
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,898
And when you share it with
someone he plays the 3 monkeys.

172
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,096
What the heck?

173
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,728
Oh my god the first monkeys.

174
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,131
Don't come dear.no.
But l am not from this Age..

175
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,571
No stop don't do it don't.

176
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,012
Don't do it dear.
lt's not for you. Give that to me.

177
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,051
Are you taking a picture?

178
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,012
Oh God.

179
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,176
But together...
Cico stop for a sec. Go over there.

180
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,416
Gents l am not asking much from you.
Little bit of civilization...

181
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,817
l need to go to my time period
and save Ceku as soon as possible.

182
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,773
First we start with standing up
Watch. Just like this.

183
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,255
Not difficult. Stand on feet
Keep it straight up

184
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,610
Nothing specific.
Look like this... For God's sake.

185
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,496
Come on man.
Stand up bro.

186
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,809
No. You have to be completely erect.
lt can't be done like this!

187
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,094
l should have accepted 500.000
1 million years are too much.

188
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,256
What am l gonna do?
Play with you or what? No!

189
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,657
Keep it to yourself. lce Age
will come and our butts will freeze.

190
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,819
Fire's not been discovered yet.lt says
June 20th. What kind of June is that?

191
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,093
l turned into a monkey too.
l had a lighter in my back pocket.

192
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,092
Thank god...
Put it over here...

193
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,498
Leave the shoe.

194
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,538
Stop touching
l have a razor in my hand. What?

195
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,493
You expected George Clooney
under my beard or what?

196
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,613
Stop playing at my feet
go over there.

197
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,251
Dear monkeys.

198
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,135
Based on the movies l watched 4 minutes
passed in the parallel universe by now.

199
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,935
lf l hang out with you little longer l won't
be able to go back and save Ceku.

200
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,530
Therefore l am leaving. Our food
and water became scarce anyway.

201
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,618
l will first find the water
and then the other civilizations.

202
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,459
l wish we had met
under different circumstances.

203
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,651
But didn't happen.
Alright bye bye.

204
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,536
No don't stand up for me
You are not able to anyway.

205
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,576
Bye Bye Cino Kati Zino.

206
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,418
''Seeds should turn
into sapling sapling to trees...

207
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,211
...trees to forests in my homeland.
Habitat to birds blanket to soil...

208
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,251
...gives life to nature
forests it is in my homeland.

209
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,372
''...blanket to nature
forests in my homeland home to birds.''

210
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,776
How did it get stuck in my tongue?

211
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,491
...gives life to nature

212
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,408
Wow look at that character.

213
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,738
lf l find the water soon
there is no biting me ok?

214
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,889
This one had not evolved at all
the same snake we know.

215
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,298
Blanket to nature.

216
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,019
There goes the water...
l swear it's water.

217
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,497
Piss off... you turned this
into a Jurassic Park man.

218
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,136
Monkeys lizards bugs...
There is just a bit of water anyway.

219
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,776
What kind of Age is this yo
aren't there any evolved creatures here?

220
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,852
Oh God.

221
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,298
l didn't say that to you for real
it was to the little ones.

222
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,297
To the lizard ones for real...

223
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,569
Oh God thank you millions for making me
experience this classic scene.

224
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,214
Bro l watched all your movies
Jurassic 1 Jurassic 2 Jurassic 3.

225
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,539
Please. Bro there is nothing
you'd like here.

226
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,893
Get off nothing for you in here..

227
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,499
But if you keep screaming like that
all the predators will come around.

228
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,533
Sounds like a war cry.

229
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,815
Please stop...

230
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,972
Wait there..well jungle has its
specific rules you know?

231
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,537
There is a specific food chain of course
This will eat that that will eat this..

232
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:55,213
You grew up in the jungle with no love
so you have right to do whatever...

233
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,653
...of course you don't know me
but...

234
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,579
Look don't make me
put you in trouble huh.

235
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,488
They make Dino-gods
through computers nowadays...

236
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,656
...don't make me separate you
pixel by pixel..my name is Arif.

237
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,900
Mr. Arif the stone that you threw
hit the dinosaur's testicles.

238
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,172
This means the end of the
dinosaur generation l am sorry.

239
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,848
Doctor
l can't carry this responsibility..

240
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,450
-Dad Daddy
-My son my child..

241
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,978
l understand you very well Jurasic
l have a child as well.

242
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,492
Therefore l forgive you.
This jungle is big enough for us both.

243
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,773
Wow you say butter and honey huh?
Super.

244
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,293
Looks like you are not
that primitive after all.

245
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,933
How lucky there is not even
a single bee around here.

246
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,734
l didn't take it Jurasic gave me.

247
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,216
Since you stung me
you will die yourself right now.

248
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,249
...what was good for bee stings?
Ammonia..

249
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,169
What the hell are you looking at?
Looks like a bee play to you?

250
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,568
Oh my God you are humans.

251
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,930
Last time l left you you were monkeys.

252
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,700
God knows
how long l was passed out for.

253
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,575
lt is so hard to bump into
a human in this Age.

254
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,899
Calm down...
Obviously he doesn't speak our language.

255
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,889
-We can't keep him here he is a stranger.
-This man is not conscious.

256
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,216
He won't get stuck
in our hands if we help him.

257
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,815
Whoever breaks loose
you take them into our village.

258
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,252
-Plus he scared our children.
-Nah that's not true.

259
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,657
What should we do? Rip his head off
feed him to the savage birds?

260
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,455
No bro you misunderstood...

261
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,932
The last thing you said didn't appear.
Sure he didn't say something wrong?

262
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,933
Look teeny if donkey eats weed that
he doesn't know he'll have a headache.

263
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,334
-Write it down l like that phrase. Come
-Ok but...

264
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,850
l don't know where you came from
But we don't want trouble.

265
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,335
l came from a different time
segment trust me.

266
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,258
l have been wandering around
for months in here..

267
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,054
8 minutes passed in the parallel
universe. lf we can get united...

268
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,139
-What unity? Are you a man of Arogans?
-l have nothing to do with them.

269
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,900
Arif carpet rug travel. Damn l wish
l had my bussiness card with me..

270
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,614
-Look l have gum...
-Put this away put it.

271
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,493
He is obviously from Arogan.
Trying to spy on us.

272
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,851
The lady rocks by the way
must be because of the Age. Stone Age.

273
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,417
-Shut up man she is my daughter.
-Wonderful moral principles are present.

274
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,418
-lt's called jealousy. Very beautiful.
-Jerk.

275
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,136
-How's technology is fire discovered?
-Get out of here go.

276
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,296
How could l go?
Give me lightspeed and l will go.

277
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,650
You are looking for trouble
can tell from your guise. Go away.

278
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,090
Arogans are coming.

279
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,579
What's going on?

280
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,613
Look stranger take this
shut up and don't talk.

281
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,333
What kind of fur is that? Just to taste.
Don't you have better ones?

282
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,135
Uncle if fire is not discovered yet

283
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,131
What's this dude's problem?

284
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,259
Are the goods ready?

285
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,695
Give me the tools as well.

286
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,260
Nothing else was done
with those tools was it?

287
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,371
No Crow.

288
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,048
l heard that you are drawing pictures
all over the caves is that so?

289
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,410
No such a thing Crow.

290
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,137
Heard that you invent
house tools spears and stuff

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:25,256
-We are just gathering fruits.
-Don't gather eat the ones on the floor

...not to chitchat too much.
Her tongue gets longer and longer.

295
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,170
No tools gadgets. l will destroy every
inventor. Open your eyes and serve.

296
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,258
We are not slaves. We are humans
as much as Arogans are too..

297
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,576
Just because you put
a feather on your head...

298
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,213
...you think you became a man?
Bird brained.

...and you.

307
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,577
Me? l am not a man
of this era bro.

308
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,334
-Pardon me?
-l came from a different time period.

309
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,373
Don't take me take this one.

310
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,051
What have l been telling all this time?
Didn't l say ''no tools and gadgets''?

311
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,570
You did for about half an hour.

312
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,849
What is that what?

313
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,130
Fake Rolex but exactly the same
can't tell the difference..

314
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,570
Not from this village Crow
We don't know him either.

315
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,170
What happens if l was from this village?
So what? What's gonna happen?

316
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,213
Don't do it in front of the people.

317
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,775
No lf l was from this village
what's gonna happen bro?

318
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,254
Bidi..

319

This arrow is poisonous.
Don't throw this anymore.

320
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,654
See... My arm is gone
right now look.

321
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,138
One day we were sitting at our spot
with Yilmaz and Namik...

322
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,489
Tie it well so that
we won't fall my dear.

323
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,091
Be smart l'd burn down your village
with the tiniest civilisation sign.

324
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,970
Hedgehog head..

325
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,739
Come again my bro.
-Move.

326
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,771
Saplings shall turn into trees
in my homeland.

327
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,413
When did you tie me up?

328
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,533
What kind of fate is this?
Whoever ties me up takes me away.

329
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,493
Hey bro..

330
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,374
Won't we stop somewhere?
What is this?

331
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,616
No break no break look ahead..

332
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,020
Ah my arm..ahh.

333
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,936
-Stony be carefull little bit.
-His arm is broken..

334
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,976
Pity. The skies gave you
the skies took you away.

335
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,136
Start the burial immediately.

336
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,217
Bidi bring couple pieces
of rock from there..

337
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,333
How did you know Stony
the son of the Rock?

338
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,496
We knew him well.

339
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,971
What are they doing?
Burying him?

340
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,410
Rest in peace.

341
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,815
Bro what are you doing?

342
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,171
Look at me weren't your hands tied up?

343
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,298
Tied up now bro.
How can you bury someone like that?

344
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,855
Move it for god's sake move.

345
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,016
-What can we do his arm is broken.
-What the hell? Stop.

346
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,609
l have his medicine.
Lad give me that.

347
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,378
lt hurts a lot.

348
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,572
No it won't. Straight up. Move it.
Just dislocated.

349
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,692
lf it was broken he would
not be able to move it like that

350
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,413
lf there were an egg l would rub it.

351
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,411
-Here quail.
-Nice. Give me a stick.

352
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,288
-lt hurts a lot.
-No it won't hurt. Stop.

353
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,412
Now it's fine.
Hold it like this.

354
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,455
Nice.lf we tie it like that
it will be better than before.

355
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,458
You are a strong man.
Don't leave us. Stay alive.

356
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,936
-So won't he die now?
-No bro what are you talking about?

357
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,610
-lt is stronger than before super.
-Go back to your spot you witch.

358
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,772
-l am from another time period.
-Shut up!

359
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,331
Our hands and arms are tied up
and we can't even say a word.

360
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,011
Take the stoneployees
to the torture cave. l am coming.

361
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,618
-Mate how is your hand?
-Good thanks. Move.

362
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,055
Don't forget it because
we have now a connection through that.

363
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,215
-Move move.
-Ok.

364
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:57,260
-Where will you go with this wheel?
-lt's a millstone.

365
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,610
-Lie.
-My lord l am from South Emencik.

366
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,296
-We are grinding wheat with that.
-You are lying.

367
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,889
Didn't we say agriculture is forbidden?

368
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,656
He will climb up to the tower tomorrow.

369
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,853
-Please forgive us lord.
-Liar. Welcome Uncle.

370
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,937
-Thanks Niece.
-What's that in your mouth?

371
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,258
-Whose mouth?
-Don't smoke that indoors.

372
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,576
-Sure.
-What's that?

373
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,417
-Fake Rolex.
-Can't tell the difference.

374
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,650
-How is the situation down there?
-Dimi prepared the pipes.

375
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,771
-Good.
-Dad.

376
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,456
Stony my son did you nicely
destroy the things down there?

377
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,059
-l did father.
-Good.

378
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,057
What happened to your arm?

379
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,330
He injured it
while beating some Arogs.

380
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,293
lt is not broken though
Otherwise l wouldn't be able to move it.

381
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,775
Look what l found
at the entrance of your cave.

382
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,930
The masks it's a freestyle work
made of tree barks.

383
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,529
Don't work!
You are an Arogan be a warrior.

384
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,935
You are drawing pictures
all over the walls.

385
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,971
Don't waste your time
with those things.

386
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,889
Father l love drawing sculptures
music and dance. l love them.

387
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,170
Don't they bring life
to this tribe anyway?

388
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,218
Lie!
You are lying.

389
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,289
They won't understand and desolate you
You'll become a vagabond.

390
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,855
You'll die of hunger.

391
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,532
Don't be an artist be a warrior
Don't get mashed smash them.

392
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,448
Father my opus is a light
for the future generations.

393
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,458
-Where are the slaves?
-Downstairs.

394
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,369
Go torture the slaves.
Come on son.

395
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,140
Uncle my drug.

396
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,978
Crow watch over this kid.

397
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,819
l want him to be a worthy Arogan
to our ancestors.

398
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,059
My father Sandy should be proud of us.

399
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,410
Don't you worry my Niece.

400
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,690
When tower gets completed
and we find him...

401
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,209
...it will be the beginning
of a new era for all of us.

402
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,618
Father the skies took you away
l will take you back dad.

403
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,456
My Brother Sandy was
a very friendly man.

404
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,618
Didn't he always lose
because of his good intentions?

405
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,293
lt was years years ago.
First years of Stone Age.

406
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,339
We were poor but happy.

407
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,134
Where there is mulberry grove now
there was nothing back then.

408
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,571
-That day an iron circle
descended from the sky.

409
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,371
-lron?
-Probably.

410
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,259
Two creatures
similar to us came down.

411
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,533
They were smiling.

412
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,850
They gave us a gift.

413
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,494
My father Sandy couldn't find
an appropriate gift back for them...

414
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,975
..because of the famine shortage
we were having maybe.

415
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,133
Whatever we he had in their his hands
he gave them they got mad.

416
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,297
They gave us the hand move
then got on to that vessel and ascended

417
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,618
When big Sandy was saluting them
something terrible happened.

418
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,376
My dad was not there anymore.
We vented out spleen on that gift.

419
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,454
We hit it again and again.

420
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,930
Since that day l've been close minded
to novelty against innovation.

421
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,857
l hope
it's not like Mel Gibson's movie...

422
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,450
...with the whole headcutting and stuff.
The gods want a sacrifice and so on.

423
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,696
l dislike those the most.

424
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,172
Stoneployees you will climb
up to the tower in a while.

425
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,410
Whoever sees and brings Sandy down
his life will be saved.

426
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,414
New opportunities and neo stones
will be given to him.

427
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,613
At least we will jump one level higher.
Neolithic Age. Super. To me..

428
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,293
Let the stoneployee dance begin.

429
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,769
Bro l hate two things,
modern dance and the primitive dance...

430
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,572
...things that irritate me the most.

431
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,899
No no... Don't...

432
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:14,413
Cut it out cut it.
Move move away.

433
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,853
Bro his heart could take only that much.
You can't make anything out of that guy.

434
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,654
Wait a minute give me that
rub that mud on so that...

435
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,897
-...l can go and bring this Hadji back.
-Wait a minute before the dance.

436
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,534
lt is like a school prom
Let's take down that dude.

437
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,890
Then you can dance till the morning
no worries. Load on buddy.

438
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,538
-Load it. You exaggerated so much.
-Who the heck is he?

439
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,455
His hair is very different.

440
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,336
l carried many refrigerators like this.

441
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,052
Crow head when l come back
we will switch to Neolithic Age.

442
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,651
The architecture of this place
is wrong. Construction is wrong.

443
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,809
l just let one fart out
they probably won't smell that.

444
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,969
There he is.

445
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,131
-Hello Uncle.
-Don't come closer to me.

446
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,572
Are you Sandy?

447
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,578
Life and everything is
meaningless to me.

448
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,010
l was going to take you down.

449
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,973
l want to die.
-Don't be ridiculous.

450
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,929
Here take this cigarette.
Nonsense.

451
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,495
How do you want to die man?
Come on now.

452
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,134
Life can't be that meaningless.
Don't be ridiculous.

453
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,218
Shield it with your hand shield it.

454
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,173
Shield it with both hands.

455
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,853
Dude passed over
because of the cigarette.

456
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,293
Who cares? They told me to
put the rock down. l did it.

457
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,252
-Someone is coming.
-There's a returning man!

458
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,328
A returning man.

459
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,008
ls it my father?

460
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,259
l couldn't see that well my friend
will you look?

461
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,775
Thank you very much.
Thanks beautiful girl.

462
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,211
Cut it! Did you see him?
Did you see Sandy?

463
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,891
Yes l did now it's like this up there
l guess by running away from the society.

464
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,853
He became introverted
built this crust over him.

465
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,370
Now since l don't know psychology
in order to approach him with caution...

466
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,333
...l tried to talk to him
but those addictions and things.

467
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,657
How can l say he was going through
something like solitude at the top.

468
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,058
Talk to me man where is Sandy?

469
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,579
-Daddy.
-There he came.

470
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,488
This is not Sandy.
He is from Arog.

471
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,975
How can l know?
Did l check his lD?

472
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,058
Take away that necklace from his neck.

473
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,410
As if l was dying for it.

474
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,578
How do you climb up to the top
and not find my father?

475
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,578
How many more stones
we need to put up to reach the skies

476
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,534
You're talking from the balcony.
The sky has 7 layers.

477
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,208
Am l going to furnish stones up
till the stratosphere Mr. contractor?

478
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,888
Lie you are lying.

479
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,892
Tower building will continue tomorrow.
Rock is upset.

480
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,098
Ceremony is dismissed spread out.

481
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,973
Crowhead what happened? l would switch
to the Neolithic Age you promised.

482
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,377
Shut up. You are the first man
to come down from the tower alive.

483
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,299
You can drink and eat
as much as you want in Arogan.

484
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,297
Based on our traditions
your life has been saved.

485
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,060
What a nice tradition is that.
Generally men die from the traditions.

486
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,133
Then let's build a ladder or something.

487
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,252
8 minutes passed in parallel universe
right now. Help me once bro.

488
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,169
-What kind of a society you are.
-Come l need to draw your picture.

489
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,575
Wait a minute dude
l have enough trouble.

490
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,817
You are the first man to come down
from the tower. l have to picture this.

491
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,329
-But secretly.
-Pictures are secrets too? Look at that.

492
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,532
lt is.
Let's go to my spot.

493
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,935
Bro my name is Arif.
l am a pragmatic man.

494
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,052
l can't take that pressured hammer
feudal system that's my character.

495
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,535
Stop moving stay like that
for a little bit.

496
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,049
Let me see that. What the heck?

497
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,935
-ls my nose like that?
-Just like that.

498
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,858
Look at those lines.
Do you draw those as well?

499
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,336
-My style is like that.
-Nice.

500
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,816
Put your signature on them. They are
published as anonymous in encyclopedias.

501
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,329
Don't be a fool.
Let me write my name over there.

502
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,098
-Bro what are you doing?
-You gotta write your name down son.

503
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,088
Those are nice.
How much do you sell the masks for?

504
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,331
There is no selling bro.
l make them to myself.

505
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,531
But it is a secret
Don't let my father hear that.

506
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,049
Art is for the people.
Why should it be a secret?

507
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,091
They wouldn't understand.

508
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,053
-Make this one smiley and that weepy.
-This one is smiling.

509
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,457
He can only smile this much
in such a pressured society anyway.

510
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,220
This one would make
a good coat huh.

511
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,853
Bro don't.
Leave it alone.

512
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,458
This is not really your style
lsn't she the girl from down there?

513
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,935
-Yes Mimi.
-Flirting games huh?

514
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,414
l am in love bro.

515
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,538
You were showing her
some muscle in the village.

516
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,699
Society pressure.
That picture is nothing check this out.

517
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,973
-Wow. Who did this?
-Myself.

518
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,809
Yourself?

519
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,019
You are in love my friend.
Listen to this then.

520
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,891
lf you see your crying child

521
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,093
forgive his mistake

522
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,094
wrap your arms around his neck

523
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,173
As we lived together...

524
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,292
...they tricked us.

525
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,893
Strangers don't know value my mother

526
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:44,738
no one loves like you do...

527
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,817
...mother

528
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,570
-You are crying.
-lt is an impossible love bro.

529
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,169
There's no ''impossible love''.
l loved a woman from another galaxy.

530
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,414
lt is not like loving
the girl next door.

531
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,418
When there is 20 years of age difference
between lovers it creates problems.

532
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,930
There is 1 million year difference
between me and my love.

533
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,413
if your eyes meet your crying child

534
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,332
forgive his mistake

535
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,054
wrap your arms around his neck

536
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,333
As we lived together...

537
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,538
You are crying bro.

538
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,732
Look bro l need to go back
to the ones l love.

539
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,408
Situation down at the village is obvious
They are yet in Paleolithic Age.

540
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,850
You dad promised to give me
the Neolithic Age. But he didn't.

541
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,733
l need tools and devices
l need to go back to my loved ones.

542
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,216
Help me out
l need tools and devices.

543
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,336
There is no way bro my dad is
collecting all the inventions...

544
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,929
...he won't let anyone use them either.
-ls this man insane?

545
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,290
l need tools and devices help me.

546
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,616
-They are all locked up in the cave.
-Locked cave?

547
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,132
Take me over there. l will help you.
l will set you up with the girl

548
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,929
-Would you do that bro?
-Surel would even arrange your wedding.

549
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,255
White goods are from me.

550
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,939
What are white goods ?

551
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,893
You will learn all these
as long as we skip one or two levels.

552
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,297
-My bro.
-This is Kibariye not a bull.

553
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,698
You should have grilled it on fire.

554
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,058
Mr. Arif.

555
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,132
Thank you very much
have a good night.

556
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,209
l couldn't come there.

557
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,778
l don't know what you need but
there are all kinds of tools in the cave.

558
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,618
l am down for anything bro.

559
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,731
lf l can find it there is
a gift that came from the skies.

560
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,012
Gift from the skies?
A gun? Fire? A machine?

561
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,688
l don't know but l am certain
that it is not from this world.

562
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,576
Maybe it is a machine of a man
who came before me or something.

563
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,132
Here it is. Hold.

564
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,059
-Are we opening it?
-Yes push

565
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,693
Push hard.

566
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,217
Ok go.

567
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,737
So what do you think bro?
lt is good isn't it?

568
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,296
Wow it is like a museum son.

569
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,772
-There is a bicycle.
-That's a wheelbarrow.

570
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,369
-Ladder.
-Nice it's a step.

571
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,094
Furs. We have spears.

572
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,018
Pass that.

573
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,656
And then there is this thing
3 people can ride it at once.

574
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,252
The thing that came from the skies.
Show me that one.

575
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,576
That one is in
somewhere deeper.wait.

576
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,375
Bro too primitive.

577
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,770
This one was given as a gift
to my grand grand father VHS.

578
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,971
-VHS?
-Are you ready?

579
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,535
Open it bro.

580
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,375
Damn man. This is a betamax video.
You can't even find its cassette now.

581
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,413
Why do you show off telling me that
it came from the sky and get me excited.

582
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,012
-Does this work?
-Stony don't drive me crazy.

583
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,893
-What's happening here?
-Nothing.

584
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,094
Stony. Your father wants to
talk to you right now. Let's go.

585
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,259
-lt was told not to enter that cave or?
-lt was dad.

586
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,372
lt happened like this.
my friend said ''you have'' he said...

587
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,572
...''tools or gadgets with you or not''.
and l said that l have my phone.

588
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,977
My father gets mad at inventions
he hides them in the cave he said.

589
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,740
Then l said
why don't we put it in the cave?

590
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,295
l said why don't you open
so that we can put that in there.

591
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,569
Give me that.

592
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,814
Put a man in front of the cave
so that not every peasant can enter.

593
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,812
Stony my son now it is time
for you to build a family.

594
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,730
We talked with your uncle.
We decided to partner you with Ayu.

595
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,373
Ayu?

596
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,657
Very beautiful girl
fit for winter... Ayu.

597
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,139
Father l love someone else.

598
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,900
Lie you are lying.

599
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,811
This is not possible.
You will marry Ayu.

600
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,815
Dad l have my opinions too.

601
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,978
You ban me from drawing

602
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,978
You even put this hedgehog on my head.

603
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,774
-That's enough.
-Take it slow slow.

604
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,175
-Stay out of this Arif.
-Son how could l?

605
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,291
You are about to jump
on top of each other as father-son.

606
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,855
The society will be left undeveloped
because of a dynasty fight.

607
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,290
Don't make such a big deal
let the kid marry whomever he wants to.

608
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,094
And then free the innovations so that
the society won't be left primitve.

609
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,052
-ln the parallel universe approximately...
-Shut up.

610
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,738
Stony l will refuse you as a son.

611
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,570
You will have to collect
horse chestnuts in wilderness.

612
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,896
l will kick you out.

613
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,739
l am leaving
before you kick me anyway.

614
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:11,769
Get out. You will be given
neither meat nor water on this soil.

615
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,459
He is a young boy
talked with passion fire...

616
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,777
...you should sit and talk
like two modern human beings.

617
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,972
You won't be given anything either.
Get off our land.

618
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,091
What did l do?

619
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,770
Uncle my drug.

620
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,649
This son will kill me.

621
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,528
ldiot. The man is the owner of the land
and you revolt against him.

622
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,300
What a perfect time
to go against your dad.

623
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,651
Tough luck. Go away bro.
l will build my own civilization.

624
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,449
Two hands make noise
One hand doesn't make noise.

625
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,776
Don't sell me the poverb
that you can't even get right yet

626
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,733
lf your hair wasn't there to cover it.
l would rip your ear off. Go.

627
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,097
Let's go to the Arogs.

628
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,413
Let's go to your woman right?
You fox. Don't come with me.

629
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,860
Arif why don't we go to the Arogs?

630
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,212
More humble l am more arrogant they get
l am 1 million years advanced from you.

631
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,457
lnstead of trying to use me...
Then there will be brain migration.

632
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,174
The brain will migrate of course
what else can it do?

633
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,571
Don't come son.
Stop coming with me.

634
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,298
What are you looking at?

635
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,650
l am not looking.
l am washing my face.

636
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,055
Leave my water alone.
-You own the water?

637
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,820
This is my civilization
Go wherever you will and build yours.

638
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,171
l am an artist my friend
l build civilization wherever l want.

639
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,336
Here civilization.

640
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,577
When it comes to looks you are
Braveheart when tough just an artist?

641
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:03,729
Look at the way he looks at the water.
Narcissist. God's retard.

642
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,976
Why do you watch to girl?
ls this the civilization you will build?

643
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,614
l was looking
at the water to see if its deep enough.

644
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,617
Liar you were looking at her
l told you l was in love.

645
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,731
You will go and build
the civilization with her right?

646
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,692
What are you talking about?
l am married you idiot.

647
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,214
l will kill you!

648
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,617
Listen for a minute. Go and
build the civilization with her.

649
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,936
...and l will be the brain
behind that civilization.

650
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,613
-Oh really?
-What the heck?

651
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,698
Do you know
how to approach a woman?

652
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,131
l have your medicine.
Come here.

653
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,130
Women like sensitivity
Take this.

654
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,088
Look at me though
l will ask you something very clear.

655
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,813
Did you come from the monkey?

656
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,136
No we came from
the village together right?

657
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,650
You came from an ox then.
l see.

658
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:34,250
-l have a different idea.
-What's that?

659
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,655
l should slowly get out from the water.
-And?

660
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,771
Like this by showing off my body...

661
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,130
...the way water droplets
glide on your body the vision you get.

662
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,128
.. when sunshine licks the muscles
and gotta contract the hip muscles.

663
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,697
Why don't you break nuts with your hips?
Are we shooting a pirelli calender?

664
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,175
Be a bit graceful.

665
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,931
Take this arrangement
and offer it as a bouquet like this.

666
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:05,490
When she gets out of the water offer
it to her without looking at her body.

667
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,772
-What happpened yo?
-Nuts are broken

668
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,930
Use your tattoo's charm
The tattoo.

669
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,170
l guess you are
coming from hammam.

670
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,019
Did you remember me l am Arif?
-l remember are you still alive?

671
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,780
l am alive.
Thanks to my Arogan friend Stony.

672
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,858
Maybe you couldn't recognize him
he used to wear a hedgehog on his head.

673
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,250
l recognized leave us alone.

674
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,656
But did he ever mention about
his love to you? The tattoo.

675
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,893
Look what he had done
because of his love to you.

676
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,093
He pictured you
on his body.

677
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,497
lt's done by using a needle
has 250 strokes per cm.

678
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,692
An elaborate work.Maybe his love
maybe by reflecting it on his body...

679
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,973
...a reference to you... like living you
through his body. Crazy boy.

680
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,456
First of all my nose is not like that.
-Then please allow us to carry the furs.

681
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,935
Can't let the ladies to carry them all.
Which century do we live in?

682
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,256
Oh please don't tire yourself.
-For God's sake leave it to us.

683
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,816
An Arogan is coming

684
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:41,854
You will have tattoo as well.
l thought of it on two cheeks.

685
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:45,211
Please go ahead please.

686
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,334
This our song first of all
where do you know it from.

687
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,213
l had heard you
once in the jungle.

688
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,819
An Arogan is coming
Mimi likes him not.

689
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:01,812
He is nuts. He is nutty
He's driving us crazy

690
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:08,654
He's getting on our nerves.

691
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:15,852
He is nuts. He is nutty
He's driving us crazy

692
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,851
Pull it hard
Pull. Ok

693
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,209
Hide this one
so that they won't take it away from us.

694
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,093
Where should l put those?
-Lay them right here.

695
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:40,493
-Get well soon.
-What are you doing here?

696
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,453
lt's me Arif from the parallel
universe. Remember?

697
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,450
Aren't you the Rock's son?
-No.

698
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,855
He is currently free
his dad set him free.

699
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,652
Let him kiss your hand.

700
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,896
Those skills will get better with time.
-Lips don't get worn out by handkisses.

701
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,739
Write that down.
lt's a good one.

702
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,579
lf you allow me
l would like to stay with you here.

703
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,850
Our water and food are limited...

704
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:07,698
...and you can't adapt around here.

705
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,778
This kid is not coming from a holiday
village. No problem at all.

706
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,290
Plus hard times are over. We will
build a new civilization together.

707
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,092
-How about prohibitions?
-Prohibitions?

708
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,416
There are thousands of tools
in the Rock's cave.

709
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,895
lf we can take that over
the rest will come naturally.

710
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,015
What are you
looking at Out-cast?

711
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,850
Oh yes. All inventions of the last 40
years are there.ln the cave l know it.

712
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:34,740
Humankind searched for a miracle
in his own soul for centuries.

713
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,779
Humankind searched for a miracle
in his own soul for centuries.

714
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,299
We have been here
only since fifty years.

715
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,173
Yo bro don't interrupt
the preacher's speech.

716
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:47,654
My friends the Age that we live in
has its obstacles...

717
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,216
l admit that.but if we can bring out
the treasure we have in us...

718
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,492
...in one week we can reach middle Age
and in 15 days the New Age.

719
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,614
... and we can stretch it out as far as
the French revolution in just a month.

720
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,697
-So can we make a fire?
-Of course.

721
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,575
Can we draw pictures on the walls?
-We have the master of that in here

722
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,499
Wheel?
-l will bring you the best of it.

723
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,693
The caves are too low can't sleep in there.
-What?

724
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,290
l was teaching the kids secretly
ls that's also free now?

725
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,853
Free public education.

726
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,176
lf we do those will we improve?

727
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,611
l received public education myself.
-Oh yeah

728
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,050
Come on kids. Who would like to
draw pictures on the walls?

729
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,012
Me... Me... Me.

730
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,098
Arif she is going to draw pictures
should l go as well?

731
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,973
Ok come on go draw
After all you are a young man.

732
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:39,651
Long live! Will those all happen Arif?
-Of course they will.

733
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,734
A bright future is waiting for us
with the help of this razor.

734
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,057
Whoever is in for the civilization
project please step forward.

735
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,649
Since your hair is very thin...

736
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,011
l cut it in layers took the volume away
lt's more convenient for daily use.

737
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,331
-Arif...
-Yep?

738
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,298
Bro won't you shave?
-No l am fine like this.

739
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,370
Continue just like that.
But don't try fantasy models

740
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,777
You should have a face to
appear in public.

741
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,849
When will we bring down
the goodies from the cave?

742
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,053
There's a a guard in front of the cave.
We must sneak in

743
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,615
-Stony
-l'm here.

744
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,570
When this dude
goes to the other side...

745
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,055
...we will go
around the entrance ok?

746
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,536
Hey you two!

747
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,893
No way.We can't even see ourselves.
How did you see us?

748
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,772
Stony.
-Frodo

749
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,653
Arif he recognized me.

750
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,852
Wait a sec. l'll blow his mind away.
Psst Harry Potter come here.

751
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,132
Go get me four ten sized nails
from the hardware store.

752
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,568
Move.
-Ok bro.

753
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,850
l bet he won't come back
until the lron Age.

754
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,296
Very nice.
-Are we taking everything?

755
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,014
Don't get into taking spears and stuff
just take the useful ones.

756
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,211
There it is.
My phone.

757
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,453
Hey look at me.

758
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,810
lf there is one more wheel in here
we can make a carriage.

759
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,692
There are so many wheels inside.

760
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,130
Give me that chalk. l will
write a message to your daddy.

761
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,217
Say ''hi'' from me.

762
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,651
Come help us.

763
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,696
Leave it leave it...
l got it let go.

764
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,617
Did you come comfortably?

765
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:42,617
Arif slept the whole way
l drove.

766
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,812
Wow l had made this one.
-What's this bro?

767
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,133
We never used it
freestyle work piece.

768
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,456
What are those?
-Wheat. We will make bread with them.

769
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,173
You can't make an hungry bear dance.

770
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,372
We are detaching the wheels.
l will use them as a millstone.

771
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,093
And we need soil with clay. Lots of it.
-Why are we building a statue?

772
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,575
What statue? We have long way to statues
That's for the pottery.

773
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,451
Long live!
-Bring them down bro.

774
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:18,451
Run run harder. Be useful a bit
Run with a purpose.

775
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,810
Load the flour cominge from here ok?
You take care of it.

776
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,499
Long live.

777
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:32,333
Don't fill it with wheat only
mix it with bran. .

778
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,258
Gentlemen don't waste time.
Young and old everyone will work

779
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,890
How old are you oldie?
-17.

780
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,092
lt's all because of faulty nutrition
Take this.

781
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,690
l found a name for you, Teoman.
Sharpen the tips.

782
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,613
First, there is no eating fruits and
vegetables without washing them.

783
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,493
There are some practical dishes
that working women can cook...

784
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,691
...when they get back to the caves.
For example:...

785
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,460
...you can create surprises by adding
small sauces to vegetables such as...

786
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,697
...carrots and zucchini. Don't get
stuck with the cook book. Be creative.

787
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,209
l make raw zucchini
it's more delicious like that.

788
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,695
Really? Don't you add
small sauces and surprises?

789
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,175
l don't find it necessary.
-Ee... nice.

790
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,769
My dear put those down
a fire will be made there.

791
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,892
Those are ready Arif.

792
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,933
Teoman go take care of the fire.

793
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:26,255
My friends we are here
with our hunter character right now.

794
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:30,055
The most important type of animal
nutrition is the swimming ones.

795
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,177
We receive Omega 3
through the fish

796
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:35,292
Lobster and shrimps are a luxury...

797
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,490
...for us right now.
Watch

798
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,849
That's it.
Go

799
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:47,249
That's not even a fish. But this one.
Yours look very dry to me.

800
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,968
How is it going?.
Take these.

801
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,772
l will cook those on tile kiln.

802
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,016
Move away.
That's a man's job.

803
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,780
What's up bro? Your boys are
very weak at catching fish.

804
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,208
Long live.
-Did the dough stick?

805
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,058
lt did.
Come on. Look. Just like this.

806
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,896
Where is the oven?
-There is no oven.

807
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,410
What? Build an oven immediately.
Bake them gold brown for 17 minutes.

808
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,575
Allright.

809
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,573
Put it next to the big rock over there.
A hole needs to be drilled in that.

810
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:30,978
...in the middle of the water canal.
Make it a T-Pipe. Bring the flowers.

811
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,217
Decorate them around four sides
with a tulip shape

812
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,888
lt's supposed to be like a tulip.
Can't you make that one?

813
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,214
Where is that artist?

814
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,853
Uncle Arif how does it look?

815
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,891
Super. You even made the tassel.

816
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,897
You can do anything you want.
Don't worry.

817
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,774
...but it became so slippery and sludgy.
-You... move... dissappear.

818
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,096
Keep it wet.
-Should l hold it like this.

819
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,576
Hold it...Let it go...Hold it.
Very nice.

820
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,248
But l can't hold on to this.
-l am helping you out.

821
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,418
Leave yourself to me.
-But it's slippery

822
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,851
Because it is turning.
You're good.

823
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,210
Ah. You scared me.

824
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:10,254
l came along like a ghost didn't l?
What are you doing Patrick Swayze?

825
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,813
We are working.

826
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,454
Ok but handle it carefully
so that nothing breaks.

827
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:18,090
No. Her hands got used to it
Look. No hands at all.

828
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:21,811
But it is slipping away.
-You will learn with time.

829
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:29,128
Most important rule of hunting is that
the animal should not notice your trap.

830
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,819
That's the principle.

831
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,218
See it didn't notice
Run!

832
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:41,257
This is the oil well prototype
l built for you.

833
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,974
Oil can be extracted by this. Should l?
-Do it.

834
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,899
So that you can start a war right?

835
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,330
lt was a test for you.
Listen to my examples carefully

836
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,452
Move.
Asking for oil and stuff.

837
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,334
You need to take this plow seriously.
lt is primitive yet very effective.

838
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,054
Ok set to go.
-Let's put it down.

839
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,094
We don't collect the fruits from trees.
You need to implant and harvest them.

840
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,291
Long live.

841
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,014
Now we need two oxes.

842
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,256
This dude brought a big movement
to the village bro.

843
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,213
He is good yo.
He eats a lot but he works.

844
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,378
You two come here.

845
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,539
Pull pull come on.

846
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,856
Pull it harder.

847
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,809
Dear friends leave your work
for two minutes please.

848
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,695
l am waiting for you at the square
for our opening ceremony.

849
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,131
Young ladies
hold this from two ends.

850
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,775
Congratulations.
May it be good for our village.

851
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:06,178
Mr. Teoman cut this off
with your teeth.

852
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,210
Give the water from there.

853
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,854
We are clapping just like this.

854
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,771
Let's not waste the water
like this Arif.

855
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:28,290
This is a symbol of civilization
Every village has one. lt's a symbol.

856
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,413
l see you ate all the crust.
Get the corners. lt is delicious.

857
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,413
Long live.

858
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:39,418
Even though it is an official holiday.
Let's not give a break to the education

859
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,134
Ok Arif.
Let it be a half day holiday.

860
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,853
Good afternoon my friends.

861
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,494
Children when l enter
you will all rise up at the same time.

862
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,214
You may sit down. What's up?
-Good you?

863
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,931
Stony let's erase the board.
Move over there.

864
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,729
Enough bro enough.
What was you last session Mimi?

865
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,135
Sharp stones and some thorny plants.

866
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,616
Nice. ln local administration
things evolve based on orders...

867
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,334
...that come from the headquarters
and regional population's wishes...

868
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,612
How about something simpler?
-We don't have that much time.

869
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,971
You tell me the duties of mukhtar.
-What?.Arif.

870
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,899
Bro that's how we were educated.

871
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,331
How dare you come to school with such
hair? Stony l want a ruler immediately.

872
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,973
T-Form?
-No. Beat-Form.

873
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,853
Have some passion to learn.

874
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,779
So far we only advanced for 51 years
But we don't have that much time.

875
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,096
l have 1 million years to cover.
-Bro calm down.

876
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,212
Wait a minute dude.
These kids are our past.

877
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:58,809
if there is a stupidity at this point
it affects the future as well.

878
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:03,013
Wait a minute. How is the Flora
and fauna here. Tell me now.

879
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,814
Are the mountains parallel to the seas?
-Calm down

880
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,931
We can't have ignorance in here.

881
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,098
Stony please.
Don't judge my education system.

882
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,976
Help me out a bit
ln my own Age... please...

883
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,017
All right kids
let's continue from where we were.

884
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:23,257
But you are not improving.
-Calm down.

885
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,769
The mukhtar has upset you.

886
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,735
Ceku! 10 minutes passed in the parallel
universe by now. My mind's always there.

887
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,216
l won't be able to go back l won't.
-Arif sit down over here.

888
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:37,332
l will harm you as well.
-Arif!

889
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,337
l will mess up history.
-Come to yourself!

890
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,768
l will distort history.
-Cool off man.

891
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,052
Here you go young man.
-What's that?

892
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,013
Never mind. Drink it up.

893
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,534
-This is raki man.
-We have melon too.

894
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,215
He is an inventor for real.

895
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,050
Calm down.

896
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:12,377
l make it by using grapes
l am distilling them over here.

897
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,416
l make as much as l need.

898
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:25,058
lf it wasn't for his bullying father
l would improve it even more.

899
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,373
But you are drinking this dry
it goes like this as well.

900
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,613
Oh god.
-Cheers yo!

901
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:45,577
Take the cooked ones.

902
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,419
Here we are.

903
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:59,250
Such a great idea Arif
The grilled meat is really delicious.

904
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,099
lt's different when cooked.
-Thanks. Here Cuhara.

905
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,530
Don't loosen up though.
We will switch to Bronze Age tomorrow.

906
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,300
Long live.
-Thanks. Mimi get it from here.

907
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,734
l don't meat eat at all.
-Really?

908
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:14,649
Our 218. lt was our robot
lt never ate meat either

909
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,773
218 cheers mate.
-Cheers Arif.

910
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,376
Camp fire huh?

911
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:36,493
Mediterranean nights.

912
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:42,819
...so unique.

913
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,655
...and especially...

914
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:53,210
...l wish a guitar would not show up
as soon as there is a camp fire.

915
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:57,370
Does anyone want salad?
-No.

916
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,258
lt was a handmade.
-l think it was beautiful.

917
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,856
What's up ladies?

918
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,971
You burnt my heart with that guitar
l decided that you are a bad egg.

919
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:54,058
l saved your life over there
So distasteful so repulsive.

920
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,251
Which age do you live in?
-Stone.

921
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,493
Look at that. You stink.
-l drank Raki.

922
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:03,136
Raki odor pushes ladies away.
Should l save you life one more time?

923
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:07,174
Put this mint gum in your mouth.

924
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:12,937
Remember raki repulses
mint attracts.

925
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,735
What's that Arif?
-Mint gum. l'll give you one too.

926
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,972
What do l do with it?
-You put it in your mouth like this.

927
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,370
What's wrong?
-Nothing.

928
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,736
Do you want to set up a swing?
-Let's do it.

929
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,056
Come on.
Mint attracts.

930
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,576
The missile is launched.

931
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,256
Hell no.
No way.

932
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,697
What do l see?
A lion. 1 1 meters long

933
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,336
Staring at me
with teeth this big!

934
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,009
Stone Age bro.
The lion can be 15 or even 20 meters

935
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:00,137
You can name the lion
by looking at where he lives.

936
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,373
Write that down
lt's a good one.

937
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,815
Arif you lost your joy.
-No l am fine.

938
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:15,010
Here eat some pumpkin
as desert.

939
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:19,936
We have soft melon.
Don't hold them like that l beg you.

940
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,288
Mr. Arif the food was very delicious.

941
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,855
Sister move out of the way.
Don't risk yourself.

942
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,938
Arif what's up?
-Good.

943
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:45,852
Arif you should swing Mimi
and l will picture this moment.

944
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,530
No. Let's not do things like that.

945
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:56,376
Arif are you OK?
-l am fine. l'll go to bed. Good night.

946
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:04,171
Arif calm down.

947
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,497
You represent a modern human being here
Calm down.

948
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,896
Chita.

949
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:53,017
Arif.

950
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,218
Call my mother you own
Call my father your own

951
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:06,770
come to us as a bride.
Where have you been my elegant bride.

952
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:12,169
Give me that. Why do you play music
and stir everyone up?

953
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,257
Arif.
-Yep

954
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,219
Quick. Go away.

955
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,172
Arif.
-l am coming.

956
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:27,695
What happened last night?
-lt was a moment of weakness...

957
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,858
Let's not make it a big deal out of it.
-A shooting star and then Mimi kissed me

958
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:35,858
Nice. Those things
will happen.

959
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,729
We have many stuff to do.
Move on.

960
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,858
l am not talking about a nuclear one
but hydraulic thermic or wind power...

961
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:48,655
..then we can get to the
Time Machine's level eventually.

962
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,579
So the plan is very simple and clean.

963
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,248
Let's not make the mistakes
that the future generations have made .

964
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,690
l mean let's protect the nature...
...keep it green.

965
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,018
And please fix this pooping-all-
over-the-place problem

966
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,415
Arif l will show you something.

967
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,451
What's up bro?
-Come

968
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:09,174
Shame on you.
Take this and continue.

969
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,658
That pooper will come up here.
Who was that? - l

970
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:25,338
See if you'll like it.
-Bro you make me blush.

971
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,532
Time machine.
Now watch me.

972
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,937
And?
-Wait.

973
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:44,018
See l came here from a second ago.
-Yes

974
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,298
lf you extend the waiting time
you can even go further in time.

975
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,218
l see.
-How is it?

976
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,615
Bro that's well-intentioned work
but not good enough.

977
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,139
Really?
-Yeah

978
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:55,969
Well then can it be a closet
or something like that?

979
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,932
That's possible.
-Long Live

980
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,335
Arogans are coming.
-They are coming.

981
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,617
Nobody panic. Do your work.
Close this barrier.

982
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,097
Leave it
let the kids play.

983
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:39,818
The barrier needs to be extended
from the sides a little bit.

984
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,976
OK.

985
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,976
What did l tell you last time?

986
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,535
Yo tubby does that thing on your head
keep growing all the time?

987
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,696
l don't really know
l wear whatever they give me.

988
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,094
Cut it.

989
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,494
What's that
in the middle of the village?

990
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:03,896
Fountain. lt hurt didn't it?
-l am not asking you. l ask Dimi.

991
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,614
Dimi left. lf you'd like
l can take a message.

992
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,459
Write down Meto,
l am curious about the fountain

993
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,372
Bidi.

994
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,698
Crow if you will hit someone hit me.
-Who are you l don't know you.

995
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,255
Hit me then.
-Wait my dear.

996
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,496
Dimi no hit me.

997
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:23,971
Gentlemen wait a min
we are trying to talk here.

998
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,819
Arif.
-Here take this.

999
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,859
Don't move
l will suck the poison out.

1000
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,096
Are you ok?
-Good. Very good.

1001
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,692
Stoneployeess step forward.

1002
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,209
Get lost
we are not lending staff anymore.

1003
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:46,139
l'll destroy this village.
-You gonna build a highway or what?

1004
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,136
Cut it Crow.
Things have changed here.

1005
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:55,056
l will come again.

1006
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:05,413
But next time
l will come more crowded.

1007
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:09,772
When you come bring a dictionary
We will be fluent in French by then

1008
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,216
Move it
Move Jerk.

1009
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,337
Arif what happened?

1010
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,696
He got his lesson
and learned it by heart.

1011
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,212
Anyway let's not lose our motivation.
Keep working.

1012
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,853
Long Live

1013
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:50,216
l don't live with your prayers
and won't die of your curse either.

1014
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:55,699
They put flowers everywhere.
They are laughing and playing.

1015
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:59,171
and in the middle of the village...
- ls a fountain.

1016
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:03,214
Lie!
-He drew a picture on the wall.

1017
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,058
What should we do?
-Finish them.

1018
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:13,657
Everyone is so happy in the village
and all children are smiling.

1019
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:17,489
lf children are smiling in a society
it means things are working well.

1020
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,772
Get the news from the kids.
-Do you have any children?

1021
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:23,938
No l don't... not born yet.
Mine is a letter to an unborn kid.

1022
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:28,338
You do everything for him right?
-For all the children of the world.

1023
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,859
lf l can fix things in this time period
my child will live in a better world.

1024
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,051
We didn't build the fountain
for no reason. -True.

1025
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,216
Maybe you and Stony
will have children someday too.

1026
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,729
l don't know.
Bringing a child to a world like this.

1027
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:42,738
Come on. Don't start talking like this
from this Age already.

1028
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,335
You should make kids so that
they will influence our looks later.

1029
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,656
lf my ancestors were like you
l would have been Jude Law now.

1030
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:51,091
Do you think l am beautiful?
-l mean you have your charm.

1031
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,214
You are the only one who wears
high heels in the tribe you tricky.

1032
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,456
But ask that question to Stony
l am neutral towards you.

1033
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,457
Neut?
- Neutral.

1034
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:02,494
lt's like saying ''fable''.
Hard to say it hard to do it as well.

1035
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,377
Get lost before a new love is born.
Your look is not a normal one.

1036
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,775
Yaa. Arif.

1037
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:14,088
Arif we preapared a play
for you with the kids.

1038
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,370
ls it a stage play or an opera?
-lt's beautiful

1039
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,616
l just need your music box.

1040
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:21,015
Music box?
Oh my phone.

1041
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,650
Our play is called
''War and peace''.

1042
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,738
Son that's a classic.
Won't it be too heavy for the kids?

1043
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:32,813
Didn't we say
everything is forbidden?

1044
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:37,819
Get out of our village.
-l came from a different Age.

1045
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:42,013
Lie you are lying.
-That's what you get leave us alone.

1046
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:44,370
He really acts just like me.

1047
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:52,371
Mimi l baked you a bread.
-Hello Mimi l love you very much

1048
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,411
See that's for you.

1049
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:59,218
Come on monkey friend
let's get some fresh air with you.

1050
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,573
Call my mother your mom.

1051
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,657
Hey hey! Not that part.
Cut ... cut !

1052
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:08,097
Cut it.
Not that part.

1053
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,932
Come on everyone. To the village
before it gets dark.

1054
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:15,574
Let's not stay in the jungle.
Come on kids.

1055
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,814
Take the monkey part out.
-What's wrong?

1056
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,454
Take the monkey part out
Please.

1057
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,809
Come on.

1058
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:29,855
Bro Stony.
Please take out the monkey part.

1059
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,449
The rest was very funny.
-You didn't even watch it till the end.

1060
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,332
Bro...

1061
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:36,300
Stony... Rock

1062
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:36,777
Stony... Rock

1063
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:39,858
Does the play reflect me?
lt does not reflect me bro.

1064
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,211
lt should be about me arriving
and improving the village.

1065
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:46,537
lt has nothing to do with monkeys.

1066
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,579
Father.

1067
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:54,259
Stony.

1068
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:01,419
No... No oh my god.

1069
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:07,613
How did they do this to you?

1070
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:11,529
They didn't do anything to us.
But they burned down the village.

1071
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15,409
Look at that
They broke the fountain too.

1072
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:20,170
Enemies of civilization.
What did you want from the fountain?

1073
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,416
Cuhara.

1074
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:28,254
How could they kill you
without pity.

1075
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:34,015
l was burying myself in order to hide
But l got caught.

1076
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:37,735
-Why didn't you resist?
-They were armed.

1077
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,688
This coup caused us
to fall ten years back.

1078
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,494
Why don't we destroy the Arogans?
-Destroy them with what your whistle?

1079
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:48,215
Let's make arms. Let's fight back.
-Fight! Fight.

1080
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,251
No. A war would make us
fall 4 years back.

1081
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,815
Let's make spears sticks.
Arrows or something.

1082
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,978
Let's dive in them with gyro knives.
-Gyro knife?

1083
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,652
Gyro knife.

1084
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:03,170
How ls that possible?
-Can you add some more chickpeas?

1085
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:05,814
There he is.

1086
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,293
Arif.

1087
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:16,768
Got it. We will fight back.
-We will fight back.

1088
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,892
Uncle Arif didn't you say
that a war was terrible.

1089
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:24,497
You are right my dear.
War is bad.

1090
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,578
We will have war
but on a different field.

1091
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:30,456
Come with me.

1092
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:43,855
l get rid of daily stress
in this rockuzzi.

1093
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,851
What happened?
You didn't like the new village?

1094
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,652
You want another lesson?

1095
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:54,011
Look Rock you are in good shape here.
But you are oppressing the people.

1096
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,780
lf l had not sworn
l would make you look like an ape

1097
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:00,655
Let's handle this with kindness.
-Send 4 people to the tower tomorrow.

1098
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,691
Shut up get out.

1099
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,130
Let's do this.
Let's play a game with you.

1100
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,979
lf we win you will let
the inventions free.

1101
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,933
No more slavery to Arogs.
lf you win...

1102
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:13,893
...l'll finish the tower all by myself
until the moon. Are you in?

1103
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,135
Bravo Arif.

1104
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:18,093
-You are lying. What game is that?

1105
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:22,699
We will play ball.
-Ball? Can't do the ball Arif.

1106
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,414
lf he sees a ball he'll take it
to the police like it were a bomb.

1107
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:28,453
What kind of a ball game?
-Football. Team of six.

1108
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:29,058
Arif... Bro...

1109
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,979
l explain you the rules, lt is
played by feet there are goal posts.

1110
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:34,296
At 5th score half-time
at 10 it ends. Are you in?

1111
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,934
Bro why did you get into
the ball bussiness?

1112
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:45,608
The ball huh?
Like this?

1113
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:49,450
Yes ball. You have guts to play?
-Yes we do.

1114
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:52,254
Ball has been played here for years.

1115
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:56,089
To the honor of my father Sandy.

1116
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,256
lt is an old tradition.

1117
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,410
And we are a bit good at it.

1118
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:06,339
Did my stupid son
give you that advice?

1119
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,054
You guys play ball ?
-Bro did you ask me?

1120
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,650
Devil Platin Ziko
Vele Zobizaretta.

1121
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,977
...bring Carlos in.

1122
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,932
He hasn't seen a ball for 8 months
he's gone crazy.

1123
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,656
ls this a joke?

1124
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,928
Be at the field
when the fullmoon is up.

1125
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:02,177
l will take your panties off your ass.

1126
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:06,778
lt will be played as fairplay ok?

1127
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:11,092
Why are you looking at me bro?
-Where am l supposed to look at?

1128
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,055
ls there anyone among us who can play?
-There is only one person

1129
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:29,535
..and he'd never play.
l know a little bit too.

1130
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,970
l know a little bit too.

1131
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,011
My voice is not that thin.

1132
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:36,290
lf l tell you to draw a picture of it
you would though.

1133
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,298
Can you picture a football Picasso?
Yes bro l can...

1134
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,173
What ball? lt is an Arogan game.
What do we know about it?

1135
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,940
At first l offered ping-pong
but this shabby said let's play ball.

1136
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,451
Has noone touched the ball before?
Just a team of six man.

1137
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,730
lf we win we will be free l said.

1138
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:58,454
Only Cuhara knows
the Arogan ball in here.

1139
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:01,379
Cuhara we will play ball with Arogans
would you come?

1140
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:05,175
l quit that stuff.
Pass me.

1141
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,610
Yet you gather around the square
like a parade .

1142
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:14,371
Are we making a musical here?
They abuse us... They oppress us.

1143
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:17,458
-Show some effort.
-Their voices are not that thin.

1144
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:19,810
Wait a sec.
Why doesn't he play?

1145
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:26,333
He was Arogan's goal keeper. A panther.
As he had eight goals he became sulk.

1146
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:29,179
8 goals? l am not surprised that
he invented the raki.

1147
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,130
Let me play.

1148
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,217
No Mimi you can't play.
Those guys are too tough.

1149
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:34,172
So won't we do anything?

1150
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,848
Not to discriminate
but you can sew up uniforms.

1151
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:37,890
OK.

1152
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,250
Let me be the goal keeper then
Because l can't run too much.

1153
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:42,496
Nice.
l and Stony will play forward.

1154
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,895
Aren't there three more brave
young men to play huh?

1155
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,740
Uncle Teoman stay out of this.
You!

1156
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:50,859
You Meto and you.

1157
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,456
Are we set?
-Yes.

1158
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:56,220
Stony come with me.
We'll go for a walk.

1159
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:00,049
Players come here.

1160
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:04,288
Will you be able to play son?
-Yes we'll play.

1161
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,973
Long live.

1162
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:11,089
The field is favorable
but we fell into the death match!

1163
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,768
Look at Carlos
Three guys are holding him.

1164
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:17,378
What's that?
-Will you look?

1165
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,330
Zoom in.

1166
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:29,015
We will practice then.
What else can we do?

1167
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:41,333
This a ball. Like every modern society
we have take balls seriously...

1168
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,896
...and we will. This is our future.
Our opponent is very strong.

1169
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,570
...but we have our special tactics.
Here is a prototype l prepared for you.

1170
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:51,294
it is a terrific weapon that
wraps the foot 100 % ...

1171
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,855
...and increases
ball control by 47% .

1172
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,452
Later on write your shoe size down
We will all wear these during the match.

1173
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,218
Now let's see your skills.

1174
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,089
Let's see you shoot tiger...

1175
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,498
Let's go for a lap around this rock
so that they can breathe openly.

1176
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,780
Run. Come on.
Faster.

1177
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:16,456
Arif is this OK?
-The uniforms. Beautiful.

1178
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:19,572
But the pompon is too much
Take that out. -OK

1179
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:23,568
lt will be more masculine.
Come on guys.

1180
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,213
Arif.
-Be dynamic!

1181
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,173
lt's been 3 laps.
-Running

1182
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:32,612
Like this...

1183
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,531
Pick up a stone from the ground
Dynamic. Bend your knees.

1184
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:41,857
Don't stand like a poll

1185
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:47,214
Dimi go to the goal post.
Go to the corner.

1186
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:52,488
Play your game
instead of showing off like an artist.

1187
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:55,134
Goal post is very important guys.

1188
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:07,377
l expect a lot from the defense
because our goal keeper is weak.

1189
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,256
Weak. Like this.

1190
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:17,449
But it can't go on like this.

1191
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,298
Meto send me the ball
everytime you get it

1192
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,129
Let me see how you pass him.
That's it. Nice

1193
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,457
You'll cover this psycho in the middle.
That guy is crazy

1194
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:30,412
.. if only that guy was in my team.

1195
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:33,134
My father wouldn't give him away
he has two more years.

1196
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:35,808
Shoot.
lt's yours.

1197
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:39,219
Tapu l like your center pass

1198
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:42,737
He put it in?
-Goal !

1199
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:53,455
Here you go.
This is yours.

1200
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:59,098
Here you go Meto.

1201
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,814
Dimi size 42.
-Long Live

1202
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:06,295
Stony.
-Will we win Arif?

1203
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:10,853
They might be better than us
but they ignore something: The Audience

1204
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:18,815
One two three!
Firm like a rock solid like a rock...

1205
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:22,808
.. erect and rigid
We're about to smash Arogan now

1206
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:27,616
He's coming... coming
The Rock's husband is coming.

1207
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:32,093
Whoever doesn't cheer
you'd better leave.

1208
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,657
Arif !
-This is not a movie theatre....

1209
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,092
The team... Come here!

1210
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:44,330
14 minute passed
in the parallel universe.

1211
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,293
Win or Die we will win
We got this game.

1212
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:55,492
Win this game.

1213
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:04,378
Well then
-Arog Arog Arog hey!

1214
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:36,810
You are either mine or dead Ceku.

1215
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:46,416
We will win this game Ceku
There is no other way.

1216
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,939
May it be a good match.

1217
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,255
Come on guys.

1218
01:40:57,020 --> 01:41:00,808
Come on Stony.

1219
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:17,819
Look! They are trying to give us
the finger to demoralize us

1220
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:20,295
That's the score board.
Zero zero.

1221
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:34,855
Coyote you think
you can just do that?

1222
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:39,980
Wet or dry?
-Dry

1223
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:54,453
Dry. Ball or goal?
-Goal.

1224
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,940
Enigma.

1225
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:16,534
These tricks won't work on us.

1226
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,576
The goal just shrunk.

1227
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:19,616
Don't get upset.
Come on. Start.

1228
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:30,419
Don't you have a whistle?
ls that a soother in your mouth?

1229
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:33,373
Where is your whistle?
-Play !

1230
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:47,658
Darn the ball you'll play...

1231
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:18,538
You are a rascal
A rascal!

1232
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:21,208
You really are a rascal.
-Come here.

1233
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:40,451
Step on it
step on his foot.

1234
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,058
lnside...

1235
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:32,976
Don't let yourself down.
Don't get spoiled. Come on.

1236
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:20,218
This is all because of me l know.
Take someone else if you want to.

1237
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:24,129
lt has nothing to do with it.
They are not human. Look at them

1238
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:30,371
Actually l have incredible powers
but because l took an oath...

1239
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:32,810
Ask if there is any bread
in the tribune.

1240
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,658
lf you break a bread above my head

1241
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,499
l can use the special powers
that Garavel gave me.

1242
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,900
Break this apart
above my head.

1243
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:57,539
We called you a crowd.
Where are our fans?

1244
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:04,735
Firm like a rock solid like a rock
erect and rigid...

1245
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:07,738
...we'll smash Arogan right now.

1246
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:12,691
Yo 300 Spartan check if you still
have the ball under your foot.

1247
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:15,130
l am here.

1248
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:23,536
Play the game!

1249
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,450
Goal dude!

1250
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:43,259
Firm like a rock solid like a rock
erect and rigid...

1251
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:45,815
...we'll smash Arogan right now

1252
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,297
Goal !

1253
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:21,738
That's a goal too.
-How's that a goal man?

1254
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:24,898
lt's just a replay.

1255
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,136
Ok then.
Count this one as well.

1256
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:47,890
Look at the pass.

1257
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:41,213
Guys if we score we win.
Come on.

1258
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:05,169
My pass was so good.

1259
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:09,616
What you laughing at?

1260
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:19,529
-Penalty.
-How's that a penalty?

1261
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:21,731
Reversed one.

1262
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:53,334
He rescued it.

1263
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:06,978
-Your hands...
-l can go on.

1264
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:10,418
His hands are gone.

1265
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:13,088
Daddy.
-What happened? He's out?

1266
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,939
Shut up.
-What will happen with the goal post?

1267
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,495
-Come bro come.
-l want to continue.

1268
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,539
Daddy your hands.

1269
01:51:21,740 --> 01:51:25,528
l saved it daughter.
-Mimi take care of your father.

1270
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:28,494
Come on.
-He won't feel it yet...

1271
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:31,533
Who will be the goal keeper?

1272
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:47,778
Kova.
-My name is Cuhara.

1273
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,291
Long Live.

1274
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:56,253
Come on.

1275
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:15,736
Lie ! That's not you but someone else.
-So what? lt 's a stuntman.

1276
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:18,773
Why would he throw himself
on the ground like that?

1277
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:28,291
Shall we score Stony?
-Let's do it Arif.

1278
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:03,250
l am scoring this goal in the name
of all oppressed civilizations.

1279
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:05,018
lt will be a goal.

1280
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:45,779
Arog. Arog !

1281
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,660
Arif.
-You played a good game. lt's yours.

1282
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:10,778
Arif.
-You played a good game. lt's yours.

1283
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:15,378
Thanks but l don't have any bussiness
with time anymore.

1284
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:19,093
We won the match Arif.
We are free now.

1285
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:21,256
l am happy
for my Arog brothers and sisters.

1286
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:23,610
But for me,
it is the end of the road Stony.

1287
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:25,333
What are you talking about?

1288
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:28,418
l didn't come here with
my own will. l was sent.

1289
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:30,975
My purpose was to find the time machine
as soon as possible...

1290
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:33,489
...and get back to my wife and my child.
But didn't happen.

1291
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:36,379
But everything is free now Arif.
We can improve.

1292
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,856
We can not.
We know how to use fork and knife.

1293
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,493
That's something too
but not enough.

1294
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:44,009
Plus half an hour passed
in the parallel universe right now.

1295
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,450
l am sure Logar has already
taken my wife to Gora.

1296
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:49,174
What are you gonna do then?
-l don't know

1297
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:52,656
l'd rather dissappear in desserts
rather than mess up with the history

1298
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:57,129
lt's all good. l got to know you guys
whom l'd only seen in encylopedias.

1299
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:00,459
No one had a name in those books
although you do have names.

1300

Mimi Stony Cuhara Crow Dimi
-Yes Arif.

and hazy in the books.

you should build my statue but...

1306
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,857
...at least you can draw my picture
on a cave's wall.

1307
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:28,016
...l am at least as worthy as an ox

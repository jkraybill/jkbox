00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:33,034
DA ZUI XIA

2
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:54,097
Yang Chi-Ching, Chen Hung-Lieh,
Han Ying-Chieh, Shum Lo, Lin Chien-Chuan,
Ku Feng, Lee Wan-Chung

3
00:00:54,848 --> 00:01:04,847
Wong Chung, Kwan Ying-Chi, Wong Shing, Lan Wei-Lieh,
Fung Ngai, Simon Yuen Siu-Tin, Hao Li-Jen

4
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,120
Out of the way! Out of the way!

5
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:01,372
What do you want?

6
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,625
Here's a letter for Master Zhang.

7
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,418
A letter? You wait here!

8
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,060
Sir!

9
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:24,270
What's the matter?

10
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:26,022
Someone ahead is blocking our way.

11
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,774
He has a petition, sir.

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,953
To Master Zhang. We the 5 deadly
tigers, top in the martial arts world.

13
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,372
Return our leader and you will live.
- Jade-face Tiger.

14
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,057
Our Master would like to talk to you.

15
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,510
Move aside! Go!

16
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,680
Master Zhang,
out of the sedan chair, please.

17
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,228
TEMPLE LIBRARY

18
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:35,003
Speak! Where's our boss?

19
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,016
What will the authorities do to our boss?

20
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,392
Speak!

21
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,771
Executed by the law.

22
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,231
Stop beating him.

23
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,917
Please write an appeal to the Governor.

24
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,170
If he's willing to release our boss,

25
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,047
then we'll let you go.

26
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,841
This way, no one loses.

27
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:27,847
No, I'm here to enforce
the laws of the country.

28
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:30,099
As for the Governor,

29
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,393
he is the supreme commander of these lands.

30
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:35,229
How could he be intimidated by bandits?

31
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,523
You can do anything you want with me!

32
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:42,820
Zhang Buqing, the Governor is your father.

33
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,824
He don't believe one second,
to safeguard his position,

34
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,118
he'll sacrifice his own son.

35
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,830
My father will uphold the law at any cost.

36
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,917
He will never exchange hostages
with bandits like you.

37
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,671
I beg that you to have a
change of heart and let me go immediately.

38
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:06,010
I won't take any offense
for what has happened.

39
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,396
About to be dead yet he still talks boldly.

40
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,817
No. 3, write a letter to his father.

41
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:24,445
Tell him to send someone
to exchange for his son.

42
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,866
If there's no reply after 5 days,

43
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,285
we'll kill his son

44
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:34,205
then burn down his quarters.

45
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:38,126
If he sends soldiers coming,
then that'll be bad news.

46
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,962
With his son in our hands here...

47
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,048
he wouldn't even dare!

48
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:48,052
Sending soldiers won't scare us. But it's
that Golden Swallow that we're afraid of.

49
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,724
Who is this Golden Swallow?

50
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:58,855
Last time we were captured,
he killed a few of our men.

51
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,983
Good, I'd like to meet him.

52
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,303
Waiter!

53
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,932
What will you have?

54
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,977
Tiger-bone wine.

55
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,528
Tiger-bone wine?

56
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:30,446
Do you have any?

57
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:31,697
Sorry, we don't.

58
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:36,118
Then some white wine and two dishes.

59
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,203
Yes, sir.

60
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,310
Good work.

61
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,979
We've tailed him all the way.

62
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,397
He's alone.

63
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,260
What's your problem?
That's my order!

64
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,888
Let me go!
- What are you looking at?!

65
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,781
What now?

66
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,583
Waiter, where's my wine?

67
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,668
Coming!

68
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,236
Thank you.

69
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:37,657
You're welcome.
Brother, where do you make your riches?

70
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,492
I work as an official for the Governor.

71
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,370
Oh, an official?
My apologies for not knowing.

72
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,331
What official business brings you here?

73
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,666
To speak with you.

74
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,418
You... know me?

75
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,671
You are Smiling Tiger Zu Gan.

76
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,506
How observant!

77
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:58,678
You wrote this letter?

78
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,221
You can say I wrote it.

79
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,557
But as for the details,
better to discuss it with you.

80
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,267
I'm all ears.

81
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,479
We have news of Master Zhang.

82
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,439
That's why I'm here.

83
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,732
That's great then!

84
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,944
Our boss is locked in
the Governor's prison.

85
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,655
Please tell the Governor
to look pass the laws

86
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,615
and clear him of his death sentence.

87
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:21,909
Then we'll let Master Zhang go immediately.

88
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,661
Otherwise what?

89
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,206
Otherwise, we'll be saying goodbye
to two lives then.

90
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,626
Then your boss's crime
will become more serious.

91
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:34,088
Never mind that.
Will you release our boss or not?

92
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,759
He committed crimes and must face justice!

93
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,345
Don't you forget.

94
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,306
Zhang Buqing is the Governor's son.

95
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,727
And he's my own brother.

96
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:57,319
In this case, we'll end our little chat.
You think it over, alright?

97
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:06,454
How did it go?

98
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,627
Dammit! Get rid of him?

99
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,681
White Face Wolf, get me a jug of wine.
- Alright!

100
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:34,940
Catch!

101
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,989
What bad luck. You got drunk without wine.

102
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,532
Your turn to treat me.

103
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,618
Alright, drinks are on me.

104
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:57,588
Catch!

105
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,307
Don't just stand there.
I'll get you a bench, alright?

106
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,738
Watch me.

107
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,455
If you guys won't treat,
then I'll treat then.

108
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,624
I'll chip in also.

109
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,366
Little brother, you should return my money.

110
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:12,955
Take it!

111
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:19,378
Golden Swallow!

112
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,088
Golden Swallow is the name.

113
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,507
A toast to you.

114
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,886
You flatter me.
I knew you're a sensible man.

115
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,805
No more playing games.
Let's talk business then.

116
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,015
We'll listen to you.

117
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,518
I'm here to free Master Zhang
and take you with me.

118
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,730
I'll ask the Governor
to lighten the sentence.

119
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:38,731
Did you hear that?

120
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,317
That's fine! If you can take us then.

121
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,568
Then you won't cooperate?!

122
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:43,652
Yes, we will,

123
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,487
but first you must meet our No. 2.

124
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,781
I will when I'm good and ready to.

125
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,658
You must go right now!

126
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,819
My hand! My hand!

127
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,906
Open the door! Look down! Look down!

128
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,370
Open the door!

129
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,330
My goodness!

130
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,581
What do you want?!

131
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,043
Get some wine.

132
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,836
Later, later. Come back later.

133
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,047
My losing my senses. Can't wait.

134
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,548
Alright, alright. Go then.
- Yes, yes.

135
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,301
Stay out of our way. Don't move around.

136
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,261
Waiter, my bill.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,682
Innkeeper, what's going on?

138
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,767
Never mind about it.
Just hurry and go.

139
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,019
It's so rainy! How can I go?

140
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,284
I'll pay this man's bill.

141
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,499
He won't be leaving today.

142
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,318
Excuse me, sir. May...

143
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,527
Out of my way!

144
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:33,822
Quite a narrow escape just now.

145
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,407
Out of my way!

146
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,674
Zhang whatever you are,
you've gone too far!

147
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:01,809
That's right! Third Master...

148
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,060
Out of my way!

149
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:39,763
Innkeeper.

150
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,934
Give me a clean room.
I won't be leaving.

151
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,147
Sir, no need for this much money.

152
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,524
Buy me two horses with the rest.

153
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,318
I came here alone but won't leave alone.

154
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,570
Find me a guide.

155
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,795
Fine! Today I lose to you.

156
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,630
But we'll wait and see about later!

157
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,677
Smiling Tiger, go back and reconsider.

158
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,555
In five days, I want to hear your answer.

159
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,935
I'm telling you one more time.

160
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,354
If you don't handover
our boss in five days,

161
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,064
I will take Zhang Buqing's life!

162
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,483
That's right, Third Master!
Show him no mercy!

163
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:34,985
Shut up!

164
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,803
It sounds like this kid thinks he's smart.

165
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,931
Wait till he comes here.

166
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,815
He'll learn the hard way.

167
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,612
Eat, eat, eat.

168
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,543
Gentlemen.

169
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,171
If you keep Mr. Zhang tide up in here

170
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:39,675
and should something happen,
I'll be in trouble.

171
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,301
Hey! You shut your mouth!

172
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,678
Yes, yes.

173
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,182
But I am in charge of this temple.

174
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,558
All of you staying here like this...

175
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,102
It's not like we broke in!

176
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,312
I know, I know.

177
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:56,024
However Abbot Liao Kong isn't here.

178
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,444
When will he return?

179
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:03,198
He said he went to search for someone
and will be back in 3 to 5 days.

180
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,491
I beg of you, sirs,

181
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,828
before he returns,
please don't create any trouble.

182
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,288
If the Governor...

183
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,840
Stop!

184
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,719
Hold on! It's only a junior monk.

185
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:37,482
Are you all right?

186
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,278
Sir, help stop the bleeding, quick please!

187
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,865
It's no use.
The dart is poisoned.

188
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,454
Sir, forgive me. Give me the antidote.
- Alright.

189
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,081
You go and end his misery.

190
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:11,975
You all... you all are too cruel!

191
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,560
How many times have I told you?

192
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:15,937
Don't let your disciples near here!

193
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,649
Next time if it happens again,
it'll be your turn!

194
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,155
No. 5.

195
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,913
A lot can happen in one night.

196
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,083
Take two men to the inn

197
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,125
and bring that kid back.

198
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,335
Yes, sir.

199
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,033
Who's there?

200
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,245
It's me.

201
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:57,747
What do you want?

202
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,000
I couldn't sleep.

203
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:01,710
Let's have a drink together, alright?

204
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:02,669
You're drunk!

205
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,337
No. I'm not.
- Get out!

206
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,840
The roof is leaking where I'm sleeping.

207
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,592
If you don't mind then I'll...

208
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:12,304
You!
- I'll go! I'll go!

209
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,893
I'll go! But I saw you fighting today!

210
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,562
Don't you do anything to me.

211
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:24,524
If you do, I'll die here!

212
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,109
You get out!

213
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,406
Alright, alright, I'll go, I'll go.

214
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:32,782
Get out!

215
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,118
I get nothing for being nice.

216
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,881
Return my things to me.

217
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,851
Coming!

218
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,037
Rats! It's empty!

219
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,333
Retreat!

220
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,074
This green bamboo staff.

221
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,952
Long and slender.

222
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:32,165
With it, traveling all over,
from north to south.

223
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,757
The wind blows, rain pours,
the sun shining up high.

224
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:50,266
I live begging door-to-door, living on end.

225
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,853
Living on end. On the end.

226
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:01,986
The way of the world is full of sin.

227
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:07,283
High post and salary, all I dream not for.

228
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:14,958
Fame and wealth, they will pass.

229
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:21,589
Nothing brings me pleasure

230
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,634
like wine.

231
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,846
Oh wonderful wine, wonderful wine.

232
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,059
May it be gin or may it be sherry.

233
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,728
A cup in hand, it's all too merry.

234
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:39,399
The world is full of sorrowful things.

235
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:48,950
Yet in my beloved wine gourd,

236
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,288
good memories, it carries.

237
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:57,542
Good memories, the wine gourd carries.

238
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,463
Sorry for not singing well, sirs.
Please forgive us.

239
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:25,528
All that singing
yet not enough money for a drink.

240
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:26,863
I'm not drinking today.

241
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,282
Are there any meat buns today to eat today?

242
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:30,283
You and your eating!

243
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,410
I want some meat buns too.

244
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:38,625
Alright, we'll definitely have meat buns.
Waiter!

245
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,463
What would you like eat, drunkard?

246
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,549
Give us some meat and 10 buns.

247
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,427
Uncle, don't pay any attention to him.

248
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,805
We'll just have some
corn bread and pickles.

249
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,099
And some white wine.

250
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:56,559
Forget the wine.

251
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,311
It's alright, I'll keep a tab.

252
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,774
Uncle, we haven't paid our debt.
Just forget it.

253
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,070
Such a pitiful boy.

254
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:11,950
Sir.

255
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:17,497
My deepest appreciation for your
generous help. I must say thank you.

256
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,831
Thank me for what?

257
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,501
It's enough. It'll be enough.

258
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,253
Last night if you hadn't led me out,

259
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,006
I fear those bandits would've
succeeded in their plot.

260
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,800
I was drunk last night.

261
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,302
Let's have some noodles, alright?
- Alright!

262
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,722
Sir, may I have the honor
to know your name?

263
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,227
I'm called Drunken Cat.

264
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,232
Yeah, let's have noodles!

265
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,385
Do you have any money?

266
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,013
Money? Yes, I do.

267
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,057
Buy me a drink, alright?
- Certainly.

268
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:21,102
No no! I won't just
take your money for nothing.

269
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:22,395
I'll sing for you in return.

270
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,147
If my singing's good,
you give me more.

271
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,274
If my singing's bad,
you give me less, alright?

272
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,001
Sit down, please.

273
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,762
Bandits come, on high mountains from.

274
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,639
The Inspector-General, kidnapped and done.

275
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,559
Rob at day, night they stay.

276
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:07,273
This message is worth a heavy sum.
- This message is worth a heavy sum.

277
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,026
Gold or green, for that, I do not dream.

278
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,945
The fight against the bandits must be won.

279
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:16,282
The Governor's office is panic-stricken
and on the run.

280
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:24,916
A lone swallow flies... over the hill.

281
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:29,003
A lone swallow flies over the hill.

282
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,756
We're so hungry!
- Sir.

283
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,674
Be quiet!

284
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:35,676
Sir!

285
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,595
Thank the young master.

286
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,639
Thank you, young master!

287
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,558
You guys go over there.

288
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,480
You wait! I'll order then!

289
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,816
Sir, since you are aware of my matters,

290
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:51,400
I'd like to seek your advice.

291
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,070
What are you talking about?
- I'm asking.. Sir!

292
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,572
Innkeeper, this should pay off my bill.

293
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,241
Put the rest on the account.

294
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:01,828
You've really met a benefactor today.

295
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,204
I sure have!

296
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:13,506
Sir, Master Zhang is nowhere to be found.

297
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,341
And this has made me worried.

298
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:19,262
Sir, you must know,
where they've hidden Master Zhang.

299
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:26,352
You surely talk a lot for someone so young!

300
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,485
I'm only asking you to
show me the way, sir.

301
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,489
My way is the bad way.

302
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:13,941
A dot and a stroke long.

303
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,325
A stroke to south of Nanyang.

304
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:31,000
A slant and two crosses.

305
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:42,876
The moon and the sun.

306
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:38,276
A dot and a stroke long.

307
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:44,115
A stroke to south of Nanyang.

308
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,661
A slant and two crosses.

309
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:57,295
The moon and the sun.

310
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,298
Temple

311
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:21,902
Thank you.

312
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:26,365
Miss, best be careful inside the temple.

313
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:27,658
Oh? Why?

314
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,828
Nothing, nothing.

315
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,765
Miss, why pray to a
clay Goddess of Mercy Pusa

316
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,767
when you can pray to a living god like me

317
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,520
and make all your wishes come true.

318
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,692
Miss, don't need to be in such a hurry.

319
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:30,114
A little later, I have made
dining preparations, just you and I alone.

320
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:32,908
We don't know each other.
Please show some respect!

321
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,039
Golden Swallow, do you know me?

322
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,214
Good! You're the ones
I've been looking for!

323
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:51,302
Stupid girl! You were lucky last time
and lost to you.

324
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,721
We'll see if you can escape today!

325
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,303
Good. Everyone's here!

326
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:51,005
Stop! These are sacred Buddhist grounds.

327
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:55,009
How would Miss dare to spill blood here?

328
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,512
I have a mission
to capture criminals on the run.

329
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,975
Miss, better to make friends
than make enemies.

330
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:05,227
Better that we go back, share a drink

331
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,104
and have a nice chat?

332
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,440
You stay out of it!

333
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,775
Or you'll suffer the same fate as them.

334
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:16,030
Then what about your brother's life?

335
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:18,073
Who are you?!

336
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,367
Pity with such beautiful eyes as yours,

337
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:22,870
can't even recognize me.

338
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:25,122
You're Jade-face Tiger?!

339
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:29,710
How about having that chat?

340
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:33,505
I've long known that
you're a devil in disguise!

341
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:37,926
However, if you're willing to repent
and return with me,

342
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:42,097
I can plead with the Governor
to give you a lighter sentence.

343
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,933
She truly overrates her charm!

344
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:47,978
To simply grant us a lighter sentence
when we see the Governor.

345
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:53,692
To receive Miss's kindness,
I'm truly grateful.

346
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:57,655
Don't you forget -
your brother is in my hands.

347
00:44:57,863 --> 00:45:00,574
Sooner or later,
you'll be in my hands as well.

348
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:03,118
Your mouth is full of bullshit!

349
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,454
On the verge of death has left you mad.

350
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:06,789
Come on!

351
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,424
You really want to fight.

352
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,260
Then let's have a fight then.

353
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:42,861
Out of the way!

354
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:17,062
Alright. I'll undress and fight with you.

355
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:41,957
After her!

356
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,213
She can't run too far.

357
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,925
Search the woods and bring her back.

358
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,474
That way!

359
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:44,014
What are you doing out of bed?
Should lay down.

360
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:50,687
You...

361
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,160
Hey! What's the matter?

362
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:09,164
You... why did you try to trap me?

363
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:11,249
What evil intentions do you habor?

364
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,710
What happened to calling me "sir"?

365
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:18,965
Perhaps I deserve it. So we're square now.

366
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:21,843
You're reckless. Why should I respect you?

367
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:25,096
You... you're a hopeless drunk!

368
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:30,393
But this drunk was right, wasn't he?

369
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:33,438
I told you to observe more
and fight less

370
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:34,981
but you didn't listen!

371
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:39,486
You went ahead and used
mediocre kung-fu in a fight with them?

372
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:40,612
Learned your lesson now?

373
00:54:44,783 --> 00:54:46,743
You know what's wrong with you?

374
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:50,872
Unreasonable and get mad too easily.

375
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:52,958
Let me examine your wound.

376
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,876
Didn't ask you to care!

377
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,313
That poisonous dart

378
00:55:56,563 --> 00:55:59,107
should have made her collapse
in half an hour's time.

379
00:55:59,316 --> 00:56:02,485
We've searched the woods
and nearby villages many times.

380
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:03,862
USELESS IDIOTS!

381
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,242
How can an entire group of men
get beaten to a pulp by a little girl?!

382
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:12,412
When word gets out,
YOU'LL BE LAUGHING STOCKS!

383
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,123
If I get hold of that stupid girl, I'll...

384
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,167
You shut your trap!

385
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,127
No. 5.

386
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:22,672
Bring some men to find her.

387
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,633
If you don't find her,
DON'T COME BACK!!

388
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:31,348
It's bad.

389
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,226
Miss Zhang, there's no other way.

390
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:38,563
I must suck the poison out with my mouth.

391
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:10,303
It's all right now.

392
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:10,697
Drunken Cat, aren't you the lucky one!

393
00:58:17,871 --> 00:58:19,664
Gentlemen, please have a seat inside.

394
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:21,207
Thank you!

395
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,295
Trying to take advantage me?
And you call yourselves men!

396
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:27,714
Now wait a minute!

397
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,258
We only came to see
about your condition in goodwill.

398
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:32,051
How can you think so poorly of us?

399
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:33,970
Sorry for the trouble men

400
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,014
and carry the miss on over.

401
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,558
What are you up to?!
- Don't talk so much!

402
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:42,353
No. 5, she hasn't recovered yet.
Please let her go.

403
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:44,439
You think you have a say here?
Get out of the way!

404
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,359
Dammit!

405
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,804
Still here?!

406
00:59:21,017 --> 00:59:22,685
Take a rest inside.

407
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:43,790
You guys must be tired of living.

408
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,355
What do you want to see me for?

409
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:51,482
I brought some corpses for you.

410
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:54,360
Corpses?

411
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,613
You take a look.

412
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:11,210
Who ordered you to bring them here?

413
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,087
How about a drink?
- Speak up!

414
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,381
What's the matter? It's a hot day

415
01:01:15,632 --> 01:01:16,674
and I pushed them for miles.

416
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,343
The hell with you!

417
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:23,765
Where did you find these bodies?

418
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:25,933
In the woods.

419
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:28,061
How did you know to bring them here?

420
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:30,063
I knew your No. 5.

421
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,522
What else did you see in the woods?

422
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:35,902
I saw a young girl fighting with No. 5.

423
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:37,236
A young girl?

424
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,617
What else did you see?

425
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:48,039
Talk!

426
01:01:48,665 --> 01:01:51,459
I was passing through the woods

427
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,754
when I saw her fighting these men.

428
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:58,174
The young girl
really let them have it like this

429
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,843
and sent these men to heaven.

430
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:03,596
At that moment,
scared the living daylights out of me!

431
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:08,726
She did it herself?

432
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:14,982
The girl asked me
to deliver the bodies to you.

433
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:18,403
Said you'd reward me
at least five taels of silver.

434
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:20,863
I never thought...

435
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:23,116
Wait.

436
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,451
I'll give you the five taels of silver.

437
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:28,162
What else did she say?

438
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,873
Thanks. She said...

439
01:02:31,082 --> 01:02:34,210
She said something about,
the dart's poison wasn't strong.

440
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:36,003
It's fine so don't you worry.

441
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,714
What else did she say?

442
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:42,844
She said... she said...
her name's something Swallow.

443
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:47,140
Oh, that's right! That's right!
She also spoke of a business deal.

444
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,684
Told me to bring back any message
you have for her.

445
01:02:49,976 --> 01:02:51,185
Let's go, let's go.

446
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:52,520
You can remove the corpses yourself.

447
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:55,064
Drunken Cat, take me to see her.

448
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,733
She said she wouldn't meet me
till tomorrow morning.

449
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:57,650
In what place?

450
01:02:57,859 --> 01:03:00,945
We didn't set a place.
She said she'd find me.

451
01:03:10,455 --> 01:03:13,207
No. 3, keep an eye on him.

452
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:15,960
And clear those beggars out.

453
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,839
I still haven't eaten yet!
- Shut your mouth!

454
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,174
Get him some food.

455
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:24,844
Fetch the monk
to prepare a funeral for No. 5.

456
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,894
Hey, Third Master.

457
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:38,191
The girl mentioned a business deal.
What's it all about?

458
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,569
Stick to drinking
and mind your own business.

459
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:42,987
Sure, sure.

460
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:51,829
Third Master, Abbot Liao Kong is here.

461
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,414
Second Master wants you to greet him.

462
01:03:58,836 --> 01:03:59,921
Keep an eye on him.

463
01:04:00,129 --> 01:04:01,964
He sleeps after eating
and don't let him run off.

464
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:02,924
I understand.

465
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:13,184
Don't move!

466
01:04:15,812 --> 01:04:18,773
It's hot. Can I borrow a fan?

467
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,737
I said don't move, don't move!

468
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,616
I won't. I won't.

469
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,502
Just now, Third Master
went to see an Abbott Liao Kong.

470
01:04:39,752 --> 01:04:40,837
Who is he?

471
01:04:41,087 --> 01:04:43,047
Nobody you know. Don't ask.

472
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:45,716
Yes, sir.

473
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,211
Where was No. 5 wounded?

474
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:24,213
In the heart.

475
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:26,674
Doesn't look like a dagger wound though.

476
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,522
Open the coffin and examine the corpses.

477
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,746
That little girl couldn't have done this.

478
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:00,207
Then the Abbot means to say that...

479
01:06:01,626 --> 01:06:04,837
Did the beggar carry a bamboo pole
with a gourd fixed to its top?

480
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:05,880
Yes, sir.

481
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:14,513
It's truly when one
will search high and low

482
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:16,766
and only to find it when
one least expects to.

483
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,018
Then you know him?

484
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,228
I went out to find him.

485
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:25,650
Why would an Abbot look for a beggar?

486
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:31,948
He's my brother.

487
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,161
Had I known,
I wouldn't have been so rude.

488
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,248
He doesn't look like someone
with kung-fu skills.

489
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:46,212
His kung-fu has already
reached the highest limits.

490
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:52,343
However... compared to me,

491
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,888
he still has a way to go.

492
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,433
Then what's his name?

493
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,519
He's called Fan Dabei.

494
01:07:01,978 --> 01:07:05,606
From morning to night,
he likes to drink and pretend to be stupid.

495
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:08,567
Some boring people call him
the "Drunken Hero".

496
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:17,702
These five were killed by him.

497
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,287
So he's one of us
and it's all a misunderstanding?

498
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:21,914
Misunderstanding?

499
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:26,002
When our master was on his deathbed,

500
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,422
he stole his treasured heirloom,
the bamboo pole

501
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:30,965
and established a new sect.

502
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:33,843
The elders have ordered me

503
01:07:34,093 --> 01:07:36,679
to kill this treacherous infidel

504
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:39,056
and recover the pole.

505
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:41,058
Where is he?

506
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,309
In the rear hall.

507
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:46,063
Seize him.

508
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:22,683
What happened?

509
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:29,648
Where's the beggar?

510
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:34,862
He escaped!

511
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,117
He won't get far!

512
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,474
Sir, you should have something to eat.

513
01:09:51,147 --> 01:09:54,441
You've been uneasy
since you returned from the temple.

514
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:57,486
I know there's something
certainly bothering you.

515
01:09:58,362 --> 01:10:01,949
You've helped me so much
and I've also troubled you.

516
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,827
My matters from now on,
I'll figure it out myself.

517
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:08,873
You will fail.

518
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,180
Come here.

519
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:39,069
Lift up that stone.

520
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:44,450
No, the big one.

521
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:56,337
Take that stone and throw it at my head.

522
01:10:58,464 --> 01:11:00,591
Come on, hit me in the end.

523
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,117
Do it again.

524
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,343
Fling it higher this time.

525
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:07,866
Are you all right?

526
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:24,091
My days are numbered.

527
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:28,178
What did you tell Jade-face Tiger
at the temple?

528
01:12:29,138 --> 01:12:33,058
My Brother is Abbot
Liao Kong of the temple.

529
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:35,728
Then you can entreat
him to save my brother.

530
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:43,694
Even though we had the same master,
we are enemies.

531
01:12:44,236 --> 01:12:47,448
He wanted to inherit this bamboo pole
and become the sect's successor

532
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,950
so he secretly killed our master.

533
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:54,663
The next time we meet,
only one of us will live.

534
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:57,750
Then how come he's with Jade-face Tiger?

535
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:01,712
He hid his evil ways from master.

536
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,464
The Abbot and Jade-Face Tiger
are birds of a feather.

537
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:06,925
In this case, why don't we arrest him,

538
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:08,886
and rid of them for the people?

539
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:16,477
His kung-fu skills are unsurpassed.

540
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,730
I'm afraid I'm not his match.

541
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:31,158
He once did me an act of kindness.

542
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:39,708
Ten years ago,
I was a homeless orphan on the streets.

543
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:44,922
It was he who brought me
to master and learn the arts.

544
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:49,927
Because of this kindness,

545
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:52,971
I've always avoided him.

546
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,807
I see.

547
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:58,852
No need to be concerned about my problems.

548
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:03,273
I'll find a way then.

549
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,656
Miss Zhang.

550
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:12,908
Wait.

551
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:25,087
The only way now is
to bring the Governor's prisoner back

552
01:14:25,337 --> 01:14:26,797
and exchange for your brother.

553
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:30,509
I can't underhand secret
dealings with them.

554
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:31,927
My father would never agree.

555
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:34,304
Fortunately, he's still unaware of
what's going on here.

556
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:36,056
Just bring the prisoner back...
- But...

557
01:14:36,682 --> 01:14:38,934
I'll think of a way for him
to get arrested again.

558
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,900
If I deliver your leader,

559
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:50,904
you'll give Master Zhang to me.
What do you think?

560
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:54,032
Sir, since you're willing to help us,

561
01:14:54,283 --> 01:14:55,909
then we'll do as you say.

562
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:56,869
Good!

563
01:14:57,453 --> 01:14:59,788
Where shall we make the exchange?

564
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:01,206
At the southern slope.

565
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,918
What time would be suitable?

566
01:15:06,128 --> 01:15:07,629
How about noon tomorrow?

567
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:12,384
Alright, it's a deal. Please.

568
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:17,931
This green bamboo staff,
long and slender.

569
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:20,851
With it, traveling all over,
from north to south.

570
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:29,943
The wind blows, rain pours,
the sun shining up high.

571
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:42,915
Brother.

572
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,837
Brother, you still recognize me?

573
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:52,424
We are fated to be together.
Can't run away from each other.

574
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:56,220
Haven't seen you in years.
You're still begging?

575
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,181
Better to be an honest beggar

576
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:02,059
than a devil in a monk's clothing.

577
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:05,187
I've worked hard for years
to wear this robe.

578
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:08,899
But dyed red with our master's blood.

579
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:16,198
Where's Master's bamboo pole?

580
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:18,951
Master's bamboo pole is sacred to our sect.

581
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:20,118
You have no right to ask for it!

582
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:24,998
I'm the eldest disciple in our sect.

583
01:16:25,374 --> 01:16:26,750
Why cannot I ask for it?

584
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:32,464
I swore to uphold master's dying words
even though I'm not worthy of the sect.

585
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:37,678
36 branches fall under
the bamboo pole in our sect.

586
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:41,598
Should anyone in our sect
commit crime or evil

587
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:46,186
no matter what his rank is,
he will be punished.

588
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:49,773
And does that include me?

589
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:53,277
Master said,
the day you see the bamboo pole

590
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,320
would be the day you die.

591
01:16:57,072 --> 01:16:59,741
So you mean to take my life?

592
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:03,078
To take your life is
to pay for master's life!

593
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:05,414
If master so ordered it on his life,

594
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:07,457
then what are you still waiting for?

595
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:17,509
I can't forget you once saved me.

596
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:24,558
You truly know how to break one's heart!

597
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:28,145
Enough of your idle chatter.
Give me the bamboo pole,

598
01:17:28,437 --> 01:17:30,188
and I'll let you live.

599
01:17:30,564 --> 01:17:34,026
Otherwise, we'll fight to the finish!

600
01:17:34,443 --> 01:17:37,863
I can save your life
and I can take your life.

601
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:49,499
May brother grant me three days' grace.

602
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:50,751
So you can run away?!

603
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:54,254
Because I promised
to escort Master Zhang home.

604
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,882
You're on the verge of death
yet still meddle in others affairs.

605
01:17:57,132 --> 01:17:58,967
May brother do me a favor.

606
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:01,762
So please back away from this matter.

607
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,722
Your affairs are of no concern to me!

608
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,183
Then after three days,

609
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,393
we will settle our score.

610
01:18:08,644 --> 01:18:10,979
You couldn't escape even if you tried.

611
01:18:11,313 --> 01:18:12,689
I'll wait three days.

612
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:13,899
Just go!

613
01:19:30,392 --> 01:19:31,393
Brother!

614
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:07,471
Sir Fan, what's the meaning of this?

615
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:21,401
Sir Dan, you have the reputation of
a man of integrity.

616
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,028
How can you break your word?

617
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:25,781
I made a promise. There was no alternative.

618
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,783
Please try to understand.

619
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:29,993
Fan whatever you, I know what you're up to!

620
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:35,916
Sir Fan, we won't say anything this time.

621
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,543
But if our paths cross again,

622
01:20:38,794 --> 01:20:40,003
you better stay out of our way.

623
01:20:40,212 --> 01:20:42,589
Alright, I won't forget your benevolence.

624
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:45,091
I'll never interfere in your affairs again.

625
01:20:45,342 --> 01:20:46,718
Good.
- But!

626
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:49,012
Till we meet again.

627
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,347
Let's go.

628
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:54,476
Thank you.

629
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,565
Protect the sedan chair.

630
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:25,650
Are you all right, brother?

631
01:22:26,234 --> 01:22:27,444
Yes, I'm fine.

632
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:46,922
Tell them if they don't stop,
I'll kill you!

633
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:49,049
No. 2!
- Hold it!

634
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:57,265
Take some men and go on ahead.

635
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:58,308
I'll have a look up there.

636
01:22:58,558 --> 01:22:59,351
Good!

637
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,394
Let's trap them all.

638
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,356
Go up the other side.

639
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,399
Be careful, don't hurt the boss.

640
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,371
We searched east and west
but can't find them! What to do?

641
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:21,665
Wait here. I'll find them.

642
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:22,749
Yes.

643
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,471
Attack!

644
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:20,390
Stop the prisoner's wagon!

645
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:39,701
Let's go!

646
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:41,536
After them!

647
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:42,954
Pursue them!

648
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:59,846
Where's the prisoner's wagon?
- It's headed for the hills.

649
01:25:07,562 --> 01:25:08,605
Out of the way!

650
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,459
Abbot, grab her!
- Why are you still here?!

651
01:26:53,918 --> 01:26:55,503
Right!
- Get out of the way!

652
01:26:56,546 --> 01:27:00,049
You're so young.
Why must you be so murderous?

653
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:01,426
Who are you?

654
01:27:01,676 --> 01:27:03,845
You don't need to know!
Where's that beggar?

655
01:27:04,304 --> 01:27:06,764
You... you're Abbot Liao Kong?

656
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:12,812
Abbot, please keep out of this.

657
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:47,055
Better that I send you to heaven!

658
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:49,724
Sir!

659
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:50,892
Take the men out of here!

660
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:55,521
Brother, have you thought
about what I said?

661
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,941
Yes, brother, I have.

662
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:01,361
From this day forth,
you are expelled from the sect and exiled.

663
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:03,613
I will not seek revenge
for your past doings.

664
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:06,074
Fan Dabei, your death is your own doing!

665
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:08,076
Get out of here!
- Sir!

666
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:54,122
Fan Daibei, my life is in your hands.

667
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,791
Do as you please!

668
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,252
Don't try any of your tricks!

669
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:01,212
I am not beholden to you!

670
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:03,715
From now on, no one will never again
feel obligated to anyone!

671
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:05,675
Listen to me clearly!

672
01:29:06,009 --> 01:29:07,885
Best that you go and hide
far in the mountains.

673
01:29:08,261 --> 01:29:11,139
Change your name, mend your mistakes
and start afresh.

674
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:16,394
Otherwise,
the next time should we meet again,

675
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,438
my sword will not be so sympathetic!

676
01:29:18,688 --> 01:29:19,647
What say you?!

677
01:30:42,313 --> 01:30:44,315
Brother, I must take my leave.

678
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:45,817
That's what you think!

679
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,309
Thank you, master.

00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,408
THE JOURNEY OF THE HYENA

2
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,949
Oh, shit.

3
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,872
Don't forget your change.

4
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,374
- Remember me to your mother.
- Yes.

5
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,418
- Peace be with you.
- And you.

6
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,420
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

7
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,588
Good.

8
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,840
My tomatoes are all over the place.

9
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,842
Help yourself, neighbor.

10
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,927
The postman's hiding something.

11
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,098
No letters from France.
My son doesn't write to me.

12
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,018
If you'd listened to me,
you'd never have let him go.

13
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,103
Nothing good comes of France.

14
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,731
You'll have to go to a marabout
to make him come back.

15
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,941
Kids like him
never come back from France,

16
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,027
or they bring back white women
with their diseases.

17
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,945
My son wouldn't do that.

18
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,699
I'll pay you
when my husband comes back.

19
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,120
Like hell! You'll pay now.

20
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:44,375
When will you pay us?
We're sick and tired of this.

21
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,090
- Let her go.
- Wait. I'll pay now.

22
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,801
- You're a disrespectful girl.
- You have to pay!

23
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,678
Your mom and I are good friends.
This never happened before.

24
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,931
Tell Mory to meet me at the university.

25
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,810
- Is he riding a motorcycle or an ox today?
- Get out of here!

26
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,978
- Beat it, you and your worn-out shoes!
- Beat it!

27
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,315
You say you're a student,
but you don't study!

28
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,651
You'll never make it in those weird pants.

29
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,153
You want me to tell Mory!

30
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,030
I don't like him.

31
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:18,409
He's got no class, no shame,
no job, nothing.

32
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:22,497
You ride around on that motorbike
with a cow's skull on it.

33
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,750
Go on, go to your university.

34
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,711
That place is like a freak show.

35
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,994
If you want water,
you'd better listen up.

36
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,425
Everyone, wait your turn.

37
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,303
Help her.

38
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,352
Okay, here we go.

39
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:15,026
Kids, if you've got nothing to do,
get out of here.

40
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,383
Stop it!

41
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,244
Hey, comrade, will the revolution
wait much longer for you?

42
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,373
So much for the sacred revolution.

43
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,712
All these chicks think about
is screwing.

44
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,381
- They're wasting their time.
- She's impure.

45
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,270
- Look at this fool.
- You think this is a circus?

46
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,274
Please, I just came to pick up Anta.

47
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,818
I get it.

48
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,862
It's your fault that she's always late
for our meetings.

49
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,155
Just wait.

50
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,751
I get it. He dressed up as a cowboy
so he could spy on us.

51
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,716
Kill him.

52
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,888
Pull. Come on.

53
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,175
- Hey, cutie.
- Leave me alone.

54
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,137
Leave those flat-assed
student chicks alone.

55
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,685
Where's Mory, Aunt Oumy?

56
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:10,107
Probably throwing up the rice
he still hasn't paid me for.

57
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,321
- That's your problem.
- Haven't you heard?

58
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,240
Mory threw himself over the cliff.

59
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,291
Now kill the goat!

60
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,629
There's a boat leaving tomorrow.

61
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,299
- Let's take it.
- Got the dough?

62
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:13,595
You can't even pay off all your debts.

63
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,059
That's no big deal.
We'll split and go to Europe illegally.

64
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,103
Then what?

65
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:25,816
No hassle. We'll get lucky.

66
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:35,242
We just need some ready cash.
Then we can tip the right guys.

67
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,078
We've got to dress up,

68
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,372
act like we're loaded.

69
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,500
We'll hand out francs
to all the kids we meet.

70
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,294
No one will catch on.

71
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,340
When we come back,
I'll be a big shot around here.

72
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,844
They'll have to call me Mr. Mory.

73
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:59,433
You can join the Red Cross.
You've heard of them, right?

74
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,562
They're a bunch of crooks,
absolutely loaded.

75
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,106
Seduce one,
they'll make you their president.

76
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,865
I've never seen anything like it!
You owe me!

77
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,034
Want to kill me?

78
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,871
If you want to stay out of jail,
pay your debt!

79
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,333
Whoreson! Son of a bitch! Bastard!

80
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,460
You've no dignity or shame!

81
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,880
I hope you die and go straight to hell!

82
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,346
<i>Paris, Paris, Paris</i>

83
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,811
<i>Paris, Paris, Paris</i>

84
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,273
<i>A little piece of heaven on earth</i>

85
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,579
<i>A little piece of heaven on earth</i>

86
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,666
- Look there.
- What?

87
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,047
Some Gris-Gris.

88
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,299
You mustn't touch them.

89
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,053
- Says who?
- My grandma.

90
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,266
Who told her?

91
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,191
Look.

92
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,238
There's all sorts here.

93
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,120
One for broken hearts.

94
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,499
One for syphilis.

95
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,255
And here's another one,
a good luck charm.

96
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,618
This card wins. This one loses.

97
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,458
Can I see?

98
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,460
This one loses.

99
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,049
- You think you can pick the winner?
- Just checking.

100
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,675
Okay, let's go.

101
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,013
You really think he can do it?

102
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,724
Black wins. Red loses!

103
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,228
Try your luck.
This one wins. This one loses.

104
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,147
Turn it over.

105
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,608
Turn it over.

106
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,611
Black. You win.

107
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,863
You haven't played yet. Turn it over.

108
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,658
The ace wins.

109
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,538
The queen loses.

110
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,416
- I'm in for ten.
- Ten.

111
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,418
You have to chose the ace.

112
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,296
- What?
- The ace.

113
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,965
I'm putting in 100.

114
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,426
Come on. Let's play for 100 francs.

115
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,846
If you don't want to make money,
don't play.

116
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,890
The ace wins.

117
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,393
The queen loses.

118
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,603
I shuffle, and that's it.

119
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,942
Want to play? Come on. The ace wins.

120
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,238
Just like I said, the queen loses.

121
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,701
I shuffle, and that's it. Pick one.

122
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
1,000 francs. 1,000.

123
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,873
Small bets only.

124
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,709
- 1,000.
- What? You found a wallet?

125
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,754
Have a seat.

126
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,007
Let's see what I earned yesterday.

127
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,344
Here you go. 1,000.

128
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,433
Pick this one, you win.

129
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,145
Pick this one, you lose.

130
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,689
I shuffle, and that's it.

131
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,274
Pick one.

132
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,450
You lost, pal.

133
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,827
You lost.

134
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,745
Where's your 1,000?

135
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,289
Stop him!

136
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,083
Thief!

137
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,904
Give me a cigarette, kid.

138
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:50,380
Those assholes think
I ripped off 1,000 francs.

139
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,802
They haven't seen anything yet.

140
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,972
Just wait and see.

141
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:05,186
Have you realized
we're sitting on a gold mine?

142
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,354
What?

143
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,983
This wrestling arena makes
loads of money on Sundays.

144
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,113
- Get it?
- Yes.

145
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,912
I wonder where they keep the cash.

146
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,374
<i>This is a great day for Senegal.</i>

147
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:13,129
<i>Long-standing ties
bind France and Senegal.</i>

148

<i>The Lebou tribe organized today's
event at the Iba Mar Diop stadium</i>

150
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,764
<i>to the construction

151
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,766
<i>It's a great event.</i>

152
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,562
<i>Elders, women, men and children

153
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,732
<i>Ousmane Ngom faces
Robert Diouf in today's match.</i>

154
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,739
Isn't that the same cop as before?

155
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,118
Yeah, it's him.

156
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:35,874
He won't bother anyone today.
He's got a full pack of cigarettes.

157
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,586
There's just one problem.

158
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:45,091
Which trunk do you think
the money is in?

159
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:49,470
- The green one on top.
- The green one?

160
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,099
No, the blue one.
That's why the other's on top.

161
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,852
- I bet it's in the green one.
- Don't contradict me.

162
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,897
I'm the boss man here.

163
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,317
It's in the blue one.
Let's grab it and go.

164
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:10,950
<i>The Lebou tribe organized today's

168
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:23,630
<i>They should build more of them.</i>

169
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:28,718
<i>Boeing, Concorde or Caravelle -
Paris, here I come.</i>

170
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,095
<i>Anyone who treads on my toes

174
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,751
<i>You can only be black or white here.
I'm sick of it.</i>

175
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,850
What a surprise, brother.

176
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,810
You're a cop?

177
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,646
The other night, right after you left,

178
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,274
the place was raided by the police.

179
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:52,445
I only got away because
I'd gone to get cigarettes.

180
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,240
Beat it. We've never met.
Don't mess up my career.

181
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,619
Smart-ass.

182
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,907
Miss, much as I enjoy your company,

183
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,952
which one of these fine houses
is yours?

184
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,750
Drive on. I'm going to my second home,
my <i>Maison de campagne.</i>

185
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,805
This doesn't look so good,
all those cats.

186
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,308
Is this the right place? I'm scared.

187
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:08,229
How can you stand it here, miss?
All these windblown trees.

188
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,775
I'll drop you off and be on my way.

189
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,777
It gives me the creeps here.

190
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,097
Have you got a husband?

191
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,185
You must be brave to live here.

192
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,438
God help us.

193
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,107
God save us from places like this.

194
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:06,264
This is a bad place.

195
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,309
It's really scary.

196
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,106
You must not be Wolof.

197
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,400
Only white people could live out here.

198
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,619
What's that boat doing there?

199
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:43,212
If I had the tools, I'd fix it up
and we'd split for Paris.

200
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,091
Stop dreaming.
Even an angel couldn't move it.

201
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,885
Think of something else.

202
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,168
I got it!

203
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,045
See all the way down there?

204
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:29,758
Turn right, and you get
to that fat guy's place.

205
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:32,928
He's got a nice house.
I met him at Mapenda's.

206
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:36,891
It's really nice.
Let's go pay him a visit.

207
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,394
But before we go,

208
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,354
I've got to take a dump.

209
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,191
Go ahead.

210
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,718
It's Mory.

211
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,137
Scram.

212
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,143
Have a seat, Mory.

213
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,858
You go join the women. Go on.

214
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:40,996
<i>The joy of love</i>

215
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:47,044
<i>Is only fleeting</i>

216
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:52,049
<i>But heartbreak</i>

217
00:50:52,132 --> 00:51:01,016
<i>Lasts a lifetime</i>

218
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:23,038
<i>I left everything</i>

219
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:30,004
<i>For that ungrateful Sylvie</i>

220
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:36,051
<i>But she left me</i>

221
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:43,392
<i>For someone else</i>

222
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,418
Make yourself at home, Mory.

223
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,922
Relax, this is a house of joy
and pleasant company.

224
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:18,260
This is my place.
You can have whatever you want.

225
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:22,473
I'm going to take a shower.
I'm covered in salt.

226
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,268
I'm salty enough
without adding any extra.

227
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:40,449
Mory, who's that short-haired chick?

228
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,535
Listen to me.

229
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,705
I'm not jealous,

230
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:49,667
but there's a big difference
between hens and goats.

231
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,337
Strip. I'll rub your back.

232
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,216
The water's just right.

233
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:02,596
Mory, I'm Charlie.
Charlie, the mother hen.

234
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,474
I make everyone happy.

235
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,227
That boy you just saw,

236
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,897
he's my number-four boy.

237
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,818
When he arrived,

238
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,238
he was as skinny as a rat.

239
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,576
Now he looks great.

240
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,286
I took care of him.

241
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,913
I massaged him,

242
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,083
cooked for him, made him happy.

243
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,600
So you want to go to France?

244
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,189
Honey, France isn't what it used to be.

245
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,652
When I lived there,
France was really great.

246
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:02,614
The Champs-Élysėes,
Pigalle, Montparnasse.

247
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,327
Mory, come on. The water's great.

248
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:14,334
Mory, I'll scrub your back for you.

249
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,921
Let me wash you.

250
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,300
I'll show you what I can do.

251
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,060
The water's just right.

252
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:13,268
Come on, let me show you what I can do.

253
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,231
The water's perfect.

254
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,614
Come on.

255
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,534
The master says you're to take us.

256
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,161
Hurry up.

257
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,034
I thank the griot, the percussionist.

258
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:20,497
Today we'll see if you can play
and I can dance.

259
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,877
Love me, I'm a wrestler anyway.
Hate me, I'm a wrestler anyway.

260
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,463
Allah decides who is a wrestler.

261
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,342
Allah has decided
no one can oppose him.

262
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,680
See my ass?

263
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,308
Birane Thione attacked me,
and I shoved him with it.

264
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,395
I sent Sa Niambour flying
with a shoulder shove.

265
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,024
I did the same thing
to Doudou Backa too.

266
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,569
I thank the griot, the percussionist.

267
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,114
I laid out Diop Dione.

268
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,701
I gave Ibou Faye his big break.

269
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,834
Griot, your drum is pure gold.

270
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,964
Your drumstick is pure silver.

271
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,509
A boy as tall as me should be king,
but I'm not.

272
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,845
So when I fight, I have to win.

273
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:20,432
My father's strength is in me.

274
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,352
My father's rage is in me.

275
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:27,397
My father's moves are in me.

276
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:30,692
My father's talent is in me.

277
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:36,531
I want kids who'll play for me.
At least they'll wake me up.

278
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,403
Let's go.

279
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,311
<i>Here's Mory The prodigal son is back</i>

280
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,189
<i>Mory, the good, the egghead
The well-educated</i>

281
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,613
<i>Mory, the great</i>

282
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,249
Stop.

283
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,215
<i>You will never bring shame</i>

284
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,510
<i>Vultures and hyenas
Will never get the better of you</i>

285
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:31,766
<i>A feast for the prodigal son</i>

286
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,686
<i>I am here before you
I will be with you till the end</i>

287
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,438
<i>Let the drums beat</i>

288
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:56,124
<i>Mory, you are our chosen one
Our favorite friend</i>

289
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:03,214
<i>Mory, you are our chosen one
Our favorite friend</i>

290
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:06,945
<i>Mory, you are in our hearts</i>

291
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:10,448
<i>Mory, answer me</i>

292
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,290
<i>Talk to me, Mory</i>

293
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:22,544
<i>Say yes to me, Mory</i>

294
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,674
<i>The prince said yes to me</i>

295
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:32,637
<i>The sky is clear now
Mory said yes to me</i>

296
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,108
Hello?

297
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,527
Central Police Headquarters?

298
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:35,283
Is Sergeant Blanchet there?

299
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,785
He isn't?

300
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:40,955
What about Mr. Thioye?

301
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:47,378
He's out too?
Is there anyone available?

302
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,882
Give me the division commander
Djibril Diop, please.

303
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,550
Ah, he's there.

304
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,719
Tell him it's Charlie, please.

305
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,266
Is that you, Mambety?

306
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,227
Hello.

307
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,895
How are you?

308
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:08,900
Inspector Mambety, you're an ingrate.

309
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:13,613
You promised to come to my house,
but then you vanished.

310
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,158
We'll discuss it at home.

311
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:21,538
Anyway, I'm not calling about that.
It's business.

312
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:26,709
I'm calling
because somebody ripped me off.

313
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,589
He wanted to go to Europe.
He needed cash and came to me.

314
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:37,178
I wanted to help him.
You know what I'm like, a real Pygmalion.

315
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:39,472
You know, I always help the kids.

316
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,600
He came in. I was taking a shower.

317
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,562
He stole all my clothes.

318
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,814
Then he ran off.

319
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,692
Anyway, he's easy to recognize.

320
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:55,530
He's tall with messy hair,
looks like a hippy.

321
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:59,993
He's with a girl
who's got a dreadful hairdo.

322
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,412
They stole one of my cars,

323
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:07,250
the all-American classic
with stars and stripes.

324
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,128
I don't remember the license number.

325
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,130
No.

326
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:16,342
But they're hungry.

327
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:20,722
You'll find them at a restaurant
or a travel agency.

328
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,141
They love money.

329
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,476
Don't look - Yes.

330
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,687
They want to leave the country.

331
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,814
I'm counting on you.

332
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,941
Okay, I'll make a statement.

333
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:35,486
Why don't you come over
and take it down, honey?

334
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,532
I've got some first-class whiskey.

335
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,035
You will? Fine.

336
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,412
See you tonight.

337
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:17,487
VACATION AND LEISURE

338
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,131
Here you are, miss.

339
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:39,133
Have a nice trip.

340
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:46,724
Miss, haven't I seen you somewhere?

341
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,935
Must have been New York.

342
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:16,170
PORT OF DAKAR
NO ENTRY WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION

343
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,606
<i>This city's rough.</i>

344
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,944
<i>No entry on the right.</i>

345
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:42,905
<i>No entry on the left.</i>

346
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:46,033
<i>Men with clubs everywhere.</i>

347
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,245
<i>All because there are too many debts.</i>

348
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:56,169
<i>But we've got to keep going.
Debts never killed anyone.</i>

349
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,381
<i>Right, debts don't kill. Let's go.</i>

350
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,243
Take me to the port, please.

351
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,163
That guy's been waiting for me all day
because I owe him.

352
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,958
Look, it's Margot.
You're always running some scam.

353
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,627
Driver, let's go.

354
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:55,306
<i>The joy of love</i>

355
01:13:55,389 --> 01:14:01,854
<i>Is only fleeting</i>

356
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:06,108
<i>But heartbreak</i>

357
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:14,867
<i>Lasts a lifetime</i>

358
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:35,429
<i>The</i> Ancerville <i>will set sail
from Dakar at 4..00 p.m.</i>

359
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:54,573
Mao Tse-tung is a wimp.
What China needs is -

360
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,785
I told my pupils on the first day,

361
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:03,457
"Your job is to kick out
the neocolonialists whom I represent."

362
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,751
We've taught in Dakar for seven years now.

363
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:11,590
The Italian Communist Party
is too extreme.

364
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:15,845
We never left Dakar.
There's nothing to see in Senegal.

365
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:19,348
Barren intellectually as well.

366
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:24,228
Our salary is three times
that of the Senegalese teachers,

367
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,981
but they don't eat like we do.

368
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,275
They're not as refined.

369
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:33,154
And what would we buy here? Masks?

370
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,952
African art is a joke made up
by journalists in need of copy.

371
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:43,414
We set half our annual salary aside.

372
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,374
Not that we stint ourselves.

373
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:49,587
America needs austerity
to improve its economy.

374
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:54,091
I invested two million francs

375
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,094
in a bona fide business in Nice.

376
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:03,267
When we left this morning,
our houseboy threatened to quit

377
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:08,314
unless he got a 1,500-franc raise.

378
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,940
After all we've done for him.

379
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,443
They're just big kids.

380
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,736
Heartless.

381
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:05,329
<i>I left everything</i>

382
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:12,920
<i>For that ungrateful Sylvie</i>

383
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:18,467
<i>And she left me</i>

384
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:22,263
<i>For someone else</i>

385
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:36,944
<i>Mr. Diop is requested
to see the captain at once.</i>

386
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:47,121
<i>I repeat, the</i> Ancerville <i>will set sail
from Dakar at 4..00 p.m.</i>

387
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,117
PORT OF DAKAR
PIER 1 ENTRY

388
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:59,683
<i>I repeat, the</i> Ancerville <i>will set sail
from Dakar at 4..00 p.m.</i>

389
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,689
Is he still alive?

390
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:36,738
- He's losing blood.
- It looks really bad.

391
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,658
The ambulance is here.

392
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,998
Recognize it?

393
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,709
It was a handsome beast.

394
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:57,551
I'm trying to catch a glimpse
of the ambulance.

395
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:02,514
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

396
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,603
THE END

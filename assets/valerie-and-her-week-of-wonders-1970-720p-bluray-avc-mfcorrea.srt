Polecat!

16
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,282
Valerie. . .

17
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,115
forgive me.

18
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,874
Where are her earrings ?

19
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,589
Speak!
- Host them, Constable.

20
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,342
You’re lying, Eag/et.
You won ’t escape punishment.

21
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,678
I’ll put you to the water torture!

22
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,767
Eaglet!

23
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,018
Bend over
so /can jump on your back.

24
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,109
Hurry up...

25
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,107
you brat.

26
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,634
Grandma, the actors have arrived.

27
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,895
You should be more interested
in the missionaries arriving.

28
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,560
When?

29
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,609
Today or tomorrow.

30
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,233
One of them will stay with us.

31
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,155
Are you playing
with your earring, child?

32
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,780
I’m not a child anymore.

33
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,786
In fact, just last night...

34
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,963
At the age of 13...

35
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,678
just like your mother.

36
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,055
I’m warning you.

37
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,854
Get rid of those earrings.

38
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,356
Your mother put them away
the day she entered the convent.

39
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,570
Your father was the bishop.

40
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,782
As you know,
they’re both in heaven now.

41
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,902
Is there some secret
in these earrings?

42
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,781
Oh, no.

43
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,704
I got them at the auction
of this house

44
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,702
from a certain Constable.

45
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,625
You knew him?

46
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,225
Grandma, it’s the actors!

47
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,020
No, that’s a wedding.

48
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,739
Hedvika’s getting married.

49
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,074
K yrie e/eison.

50
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,294
Lord, have mercy on her.

51
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,583
Deliver her from thy wrath...

52
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,882
Poor Hedvika.

53
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,628
Why?

54
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,259
She’ll be
a rich landowner’s wife now.

55
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,158
Grandma!

56
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,159
A monster!

57
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,052
It can't be him.

58
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,721
He's dead, after all.

59
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,516
Who are you talking about,
Grandma?

60
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,692
Go practice your scales.

61
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,228
Yes, Grandma.

62
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,658
“Beautiful maiden...

63
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,454
it was / who stole
your earrings

64
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,965
and then returned them
into your hands.

65
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,629
My uncle, the Constable,
longs to seize them.

66
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,132
He lulled
my father and mother,

67
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,392
and now/ fear for your fate.

68
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,637

00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,476

71
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,991
that / m/ght disguise myself
and speak to you in church.

72
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,785
Your poor Eaglet. ”

73
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,617
Valerie!

74
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,496
Where are you, child?

75
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,178
It's time to dress for church.

76
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,517
Grandma, may I bring
a sprig of rosemary?

77
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,798
l, a servant of the Lord...

78
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,133
and a missionary...

79
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,135
have come among you today,
dear maidens...

80
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,135
for your instruction
and edification.

81
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,303
O virginal maiden...

82
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,938
do you know what you are?

83
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,605
You're an alabaster hand
proffered in greeting.

84
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:51,822
You're a pomegranate
yet to be split open.

85
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,944
You're a boat-shaped leaf,

86
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,696
an opening rosebud.

87
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,075
The callous hand

88
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,202
that would touch your breast

89
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,249
would leave
an indelible imprint.

90
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,841
In place
of your guardian angel,

91
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,888
| bend down to you...

92
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,519
and with
the most exquisite ointment

93
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,563
| bless your lips,
your breasts...

94
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,403
your loins.

95
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,712
Eaglet.

96
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,043
Eaglet.

97
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,948
Valerie...

98
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,945
is it really you?

99
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,625
That monster tortured me.

100
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,709
Valerie, I want to give
you some advice.

101
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,625
- We’re in the town square.
- Forgive me.

102
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,676
Hide your eyes.

103
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,845
Now?

104
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,681
Now!

105
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,516
Here I am.

106
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,143
First of all...

107
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,463
Where is the parish poorhouse,
dear child?

108
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,546
Over there, Father.

109
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,340
You're performing
an act of mercy.

110
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,764
Or perhaps you mind
taking me there?

111
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,520
Not at all, Father.

112
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,569
In God’s name, I beg of you!

113
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,243
You go in first.

114
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,953
Go on. Don’t be afraid.

115
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,590
Welcome.

116
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:29,008
This is my kingdom.

117
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,119
Valerie...

118
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,132
come closer.

119
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,127
Closer.

120
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,179
Come and you will see.

121
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,934
Look.

122
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,311
No!

123
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:27,450
I know that you love me
no longer, my Gracian.

124
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:32,576
Just five years ago,
when you were last here...

125
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,159
but now!

126
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,290
Away with you!

127
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,835
I’ll whip myself!

128
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,921
Grandma!

129
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,549
Keep watching.

130
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,401
This is only a dream.

131
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,993
l’m asleep...

132
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,200
and all this is a dream.

133
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,635
Did he hurt you?

134
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,383
No.

135
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,639
He wants you to love him.

136
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,310
How can I love him
when I’m afraid of him?

137
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,401
That’s exactly why.

138
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,825
Eaglet!

139
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,280
I’m waiting for you,
Constable.

140
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,782
Damned medd/er/

141
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,540
Hands up or I'll shoot, thief!

142
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,750
Elsa...

143
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,457
it’s me.

144
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,127
Do you not recognize me?

145
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,761
Richard!

146
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,808
It's been so long
since anyone called me

147
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,931
by that name.

148
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,442
Why have you come, Richard?

149
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,029
I missed you.

150
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,911
Since the day you seduced
and abandoned me...

151
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,378
I’ve never loved another man.

152
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,377
How sad.

153
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,218
How old you are now, Elsa!

154
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,347
You were 17 back then.

155
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,141
What I’d give to become
young again like you!

156
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,771
Richard...

157
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,979
tell me your secret.

158
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,277
I’ll give you
anything you want!

159
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,530
Give me back this house.

160
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,789
That would be robbing Valerie.

161
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:30,337
You’re ready
to commit far worse acts.

162
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,181
I’ll do anything you say.

163
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,967
Good.

164
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,270
Let’s draw up a little contract.

165
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,855
You will be young
and beautiful again.

166
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,778
It will happen tonight,

167
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,023
at that miserly
landowner’s wedding.

168
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,654
You're the devil!

169
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,951
This pearl will save you.

170
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,370
Eaglet, where’s Valerie?

171
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,002
- I carried her off.
- To where?

172
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,667
The church tower.

173
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,712
Come here, you fool!

174
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,836
You will take me there too!

175
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,861
Let us pray.

176
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,793
Hear that?

177
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:47,227
Three times now the bells have
begun ringing and then gone silent.

178
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,942
This is excellent.

179
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,155
Hardship always leaves one
with an appetite,

180
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,278
and I experienced
a good many things

181
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,947
on my mission
among the cannibals.

182
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,994
We saved
a young black woman.

183
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,086
She was very beautiful.

184
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,627
What became of her, Father?

185
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,002
We took her to our tent

186
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,806
and converted her to our faith.

187
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,219
She showed great talent.

188
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,729
Did she become a nun?

189
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,557
No, unfortunately.

190
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,186
We lost her in a French port.

191
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,355
Marta, where’s the wine?

192
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,695
One day I’ll tell you
what became of her.

193
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,867
She fell into immoral ways

194
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,324
and sinned against
the sixth commandment.

195
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,374
I’ll give you a talk
on the subject, dear child.

196
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,371
Thank you, Father.

197
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,215
Your father, the bishop,
was a refined and sensitive man.

198
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,889
He’d faint when the prostitutes
came to confession,

199
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,434
and all the beautiful women
adored him.

200
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,228
I’ll tell you more
some other time.

201
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,731
How many children
did he have?

202
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,893
He had you...

203
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,028
and a boy named Eaglet.

204
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,026
Eaglet?

205
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,983
What is it?

206
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,659
I have a headache.
May I go lie down?

207
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,875
- Dinner’s not over yet.
- Forgive me.

208
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,577
Will you toast with us?

209
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,211
I’ve never had wine.

210
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,926
Today will be an exception.

211
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,556
In memory of the late bishop.

212
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,062
Eaglet!

213
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,740
I've come to speak with you,
dear child.

214
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,828
Now, Father?

215
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,950
There is no better time
for contemplation.

216
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,126
What beautiful breasts
you have!

217
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,164
Please go away, Father!

218
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,258
What I desire from you
is sweet.

219
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,978
You're so lovely.

220
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,896
You're magnificent.
- Go away!

221
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,820
You're ravishing!

222
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,614
I’II fight you off, you coward!

223
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,235
My death will be
on your conscience.

224
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,708
What have you done?

225
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,230
The fowl plague!

226
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,696
The fowl plague is here!

227
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,522
It is done.

228
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,455
My house is yours again.

229
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,128
And now we will wait
until midnight...

230
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,300
by the conjugal bed.

231
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,755
Come.

232
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,010
It is time.

233
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,646
All my dreams
have come to nothing.

234
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,240
Come. It is time.

235
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,206
lam old.

236
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,168
I shall grow old too.

237
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,668
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

238
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,615
Not a drop of blood.

239
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,694
Don’t cry.

240
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,740
You look old when you cry.

241
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,154
Eaglet!

242
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,050
Here.

243
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,018
- Don’t look at me like that.
- Like what?

244
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
Kneel down.

245
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,899
Kneel down!

246
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,407
- Is it too cold?
- No.

247
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,330
I’m like a blind man.

248
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,716
There’s an empty guest room
at our house.

249
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,919
You can rest there.

250
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,635
That bastard threw me down
from the tower.

251
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,883
The clapper of the bell
saved me.

252
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,892
I heard it toll very oddly.

253
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,308
I prayed for you.

254
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,947
The plague
is our best friend.

255
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,823
Without enough fresh blood,
my uncle the Constable

256
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,542
will die like an animal.
- You’re so cruel!

257
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,333
He's been ripe for death
for a hundred years,

258
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,126
the monster.

259
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,681
It’s nothing. Just a man
hanging from the window.

260
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,023
Where are we?

261
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,276
Still right under your house.

262
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,944
I’m afraid.

263
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,954
Be brave.

264
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,783
Who’s inside these coffins?

265
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:39,045
Victims of the Polecat,
their veins sucked dry. Look.

266
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,424
Grandma!

267
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,373
Forgive me.
I wasn’t suitably dressed.

268
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,135
This is your room.

269
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,019
I thought
this room was empty.

270
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,105
I arrived on the night coach.

271
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,811
Don’t you recognize me?
I'm a distant cousin.

272
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,737
Call me Elsa.

273
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,365
Valerie.

274
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,661
And this is... my brother.

275
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,197
Eaglet.

276
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,326
I’ve taken your room...

277
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,079
it would seem.

278
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,207
You're welcome to it.

279
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,094
No, Icouldn’t.
You’ll find me another, won’t you?

280
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,804
I’ll ask Grandma.

281
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,550
Your grandma has gone away,
dear child.

282
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,890
Without saying good-bye?

283
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:21,932
Old people have
their odd whims.

284
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,197
But I’m sure you’ll allow me
to stay in her quarters.

285
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,861
With pleasure.

286
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,535
This room is yours, then.

287
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,913
Here you are.

288
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,634
I’d love to go for a horse ride.

289
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,761
I’II lend you my horse.

290
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,020
I’m very tired.
I’m going to lie down.

291
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,111
You really don’t recognize me?

292
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,780
No.

293
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,285
You're not afraid of me,
are you?

294
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,751
But these are
silly questions, my dear...

295
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,800
since we only just met.

296
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,287
My earrings!

297
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,198
Your sister
still hasn’t returned?

298
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,867
Where’s Valerie?
You must know.

299
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,331
You’re adorable
when you’re angry.

300
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,294
Where’s Valerie?

301
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,133
I’ll tell you on one condition.

302
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,305
You must make love to me.

303
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,973
Never!

304
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,771
Leave this room.

305
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,440
No.

306
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,314
I’m not your guest here.
You leave!

307
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,362
You'll regret this.

308
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,501
You will die
a glorious death!

309
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,878
Die, Valerie!

310
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,717
Die!

311
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,053
Eaglet!

312
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:57,396
Good night, my dark-haired girl

313
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:02,064
Good night and sweet dreams

314
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,612
When you wake

315
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,736
My love

316
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:12,241
Do not re veal your secret

317
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,165
Valerie, you’re saved.

318
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,245
I heard everything.

319
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,790
My cousin’s in love with you.

320
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,418
- Your cousin?
- I know.

321
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,419
She is Grandma.

322
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,256
She stole my earrings.

323
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,550
But they were empty.

324
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,727
Here lies their secret.

325
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,975
They’ll protect you
from mortal danger.

326
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,067
Beware of the Polecat.

327
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,650
Where is he?

328
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,315
- He’s dying.
- Poorthing.

329
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,282
He's bewitched you.

330
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,956
Valerie...

331
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,121
I love you.

332
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,542
No, you mustn’t!
We’re brother and sister!

333
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,008
The bishop was our father.
- That’s not true!

334
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,797
Come back!

335
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,259
Valerie!
The Polecat is my father!

336
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,394
lwill, I will not...

337
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,100
lwill!

338
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,568
I’m dying!

339
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,688
I’m dying!

340
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,321
Now you know
what it’s like to be old

341
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,155
You're wasting your breath.

342
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,740
Valerie’s dying.

343
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,086
I sacrificed her for my youth.

344
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,384
You're doomed just like me.

345
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,802
You’ll suffer
the same convulsions.

346
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:20,471
Only your granddaughter
could have saved us both,

347
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,105
because she has my blood.

348
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,268
How could that be?
Her father was the bishop.

349
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,230
I was the bishop!

350
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,278
I’m Valerie’s father!

351
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,281
You're lying.

352
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,200
Something to drink!

353
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,327
No!

354
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,542
First tell me
how to prolong my youth.

355
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,627
Save Valerie.

356
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,964
In her blood lies our salvation.

357
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,803
Valerie.

358
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,140
Cursed Valerie!

359
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,690
It’s me...

360
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,977
Father.

361
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,272
My child.

362
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,281
Here.

363
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,495
No, it's too disgusting!

364
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,502
I’m just a man again,

365
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,920
and I must die.

366
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,636
No, you won’t die.

367
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,629
You saved me.

368
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,419
Father!

369
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,556
- Let me go!
- I’m a monster again!

370
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,312
Let me go!

371
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,565
Leave me alone!

372
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,068
No!

373
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,297
Gracianl

374
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,342
My Gracia’nl

375
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,985
Your lover
is sleeping like a log.

376
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,730
Gracian.

377
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,116
Poor Gracian.

378
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,122
l have a plan, Elsa.

379
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,336
I need Eaglet’s heart.

380
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,800
You mean to kill Eaglet?

381
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,671
His heart will revive my daughter
and give her eternal youth.

382
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,512
Richard, transplant Eaglet's heart
into my breast.

383
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,852
You're betraying Valerie.

384
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,940
Richard, you'll do as I say.

385
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,861
With a bleeding heart.

386
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,541
Eaglet...

387
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,952
why did I abandon you?

388
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,559
Help!

389
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,854
Why do you haunt me, Valerie?

390
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,860
Don’t be afraid.

391
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,404
I’m not dead,
and neither are you.

392
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,199
Come.
I’ll lead you out of here.

393
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,916
The rectory
is across the way, Father.

394
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,296
You tempted me to sin,
wicked girl!

395
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,589
You will get your due.

396
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,808
“Valerie. . .

397
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,100
this is good-bye.

398
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,065
You abandoned me,

399
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,688
and that monster
def/led your llps.

400
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:08,154
We could have been
so happy together.

401
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,485
Trust me, Valerie...

402
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,077
the Polecat is neither
your father nor mine.

403
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,043
You We prolonged his life.

404
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,715
/ wanted to be your protector, friend,
and husband, but it’s too late.

405
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,632
Farewell, Valerie.

406
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,589
Your Eaglet. ”

407
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,136
Valerie, what's wrong?
Come.

408
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,300
Hedvika!

409
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,236
Hedvika.

410
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,735
What’s wrong?

411
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,957
I’ve been wasting away
since my wedding day.

412
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,293
- You must eat hearty soups.
- No.

413
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,749
I’m in a vampire’s power.

414
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,686
Valerie...

415
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,772
look at my shoulder.

416
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,446
Does it hurt?

417
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,239
No.

418
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,535
- You notice anything about my lips?
- No. Why?

419
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,573
Aren't they stained?

420
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,877
You’ve been eating berries.

421
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,592
When you‘re with me,
I’m not afraid of anything.

422
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,765
I’m so happy.

423
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,681
I’ve never had a close girlfriend.

424
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,460
Valerie, I’m saved!

425
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,923
Look. The marks are gone.

426
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,105
Your kisses
have restored my health.

427
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,270
You're so beautiful.

428
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,106
There’s a witch living among you.

429
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,825
She tormented me
with her sinful words.

430
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:59,663
She pressed
her fawning hips against me.

431
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:04,372
When she saw that I could
bravely resist her temptations,

432
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,120
she threw a noose
around my neck.

433
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,466
I thank God that l escaped
safe and sound.

434
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,342
But that witch

435
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,841
is now hiding among you!

436
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:23,646
Hand her over!
She must burn at the stake!

437
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,436
That’s a lie!
Don’t believe him!

438
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,727
There’s the witch now!

439
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,696
Don’t believe him!
I swear he’s lying!

440
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,940
Begone, Satan!

441
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:38,368
Seize her!
To the stake with her!

442
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,263
Confess that you’re a witch!

443
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,603
Liar! Pyromaniac!

444
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,639
Repent!

445
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,230
Hairy-faced clown!

446
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,934
Eaglet, why hast thou
forsaken me?

447
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,654
Here she is! She’s lo ve/yl

448
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,177
Our masters,
back from their tra ve/s,

449
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:51,053
will give us
their hands and feet.

450
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,475
They will rest their heads,

451
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,690
and we will kiss them.

452
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,992
Come here, you trollops!

453
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:13,371
You ever had
a good thrashing?

454
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,766
Beast!

455
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,290
Drink deeply, Richard.

456
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,540
He's gone!

457
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,756
The Polecat!

458
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,735
May the power
of these spells be broken.

459
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:24,400
Good night, my dark-haired girl

460
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:31,983
Good night and sweet dreams

461
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:40,412
When you wake, my lo ve

462
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:47,832
Do not re veal your secret

463
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,364
Grandma!

464
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,290
Where were you?

465
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,124
Where do you think, child?
I was at church.

466
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,930
Have the missionaries gone?

467
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,063
What missionaries?

468
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,524
What’s the matter, my child?

469
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,648
Nothing, Grandma.

470
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,045
Grandma?

471
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,389
There’s a strange man outside.

472
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:26,437
That’s just one of the actors
wandering around the town.

473
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,627
My dearest...

474
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,717
do not go to the theater

475
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,128
instead . .

476
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:05,514
have the horses
hitched up at once

477
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,726
and drive to the Blue Lake.

478
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,441
Don’t shoot, for God’s sake!

479
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,244
No!

480
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,915
Miss/

481
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,589
Your grandma is dying!

482
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,303
Grandma!

483
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,926
Dearest Grandma, what is it?

484
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,558
Grandma.

485
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,948
The mirror.

486
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:24,514
A coach with no coachman
has left the courtyard.

487
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,477
That’s a good sign.

488
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:34,349
I’ve never had the courage
to tell you the truth.

489
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:45,614
Your mother loved
a certain young gamekeeper.

490
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,159
She gave him two children,

491
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,212
a boy and a girl.

492
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:04,464
But Richard, my lover,
told me the children were his,

493
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,011
and out ofjealousy

494
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,471
I drove your mother
from this house.

495
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,644
I kept the little girl.

496
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,352
You are that girl.

497
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,609
Richard took Eaglet away
to some unknown place.

498
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:22,109
I drove your mother out
with the words...

499
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,528
“I’ll take you back

500
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,402
when the horses
bring you back on their own.”

501
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,904
Then my mother’s still alive?

502
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,167
Grandma!

503
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,903
Mother!

504
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,745
My child.

505
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,462
This is your father, my dear.

506
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,516
I’ve seen your face
somewhere before, Father.

507
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,229
An early childhood memory,
no doubt.

508
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,699
Is all this but a dream?

509
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,497
If only your grandmother
would forgive me.

510
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:58,012
Good night my wizard

511
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:04,602
Hear your fairy, how she cries

512
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:11,025
Hear her cry so hopeless/y

513
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:17,618
The night weaves
a cloak of grief for her

514
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,087
Good night, my dark-haired girl

515
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,089
Good night

516
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:30,506
And sweet dreams

517
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:38,226
When you wake, my lo ve

518
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:43,724
Do not re veal your secret

519
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:50,144
THE END

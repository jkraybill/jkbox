16
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,027
I've done nothing

17
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:17,528
Waiter

00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,403
Let me go!

20
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,763
Hey, why are you treating a child so badly

21
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,773
l'm treating him badly’? He was stealing my rice

22
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,070
Ok, let me compensate for it

23
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,171
Let's go

24
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,457
Sorry, I'm sorry

25
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,494
Take out the money, quickly

26
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,431
You listening?

27
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,365
You'd better release me! Stop harassing me!

28
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,329
And what if I don't release you?

29
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,629
l'll beat you down

30
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,368
You trying to hit me or what?

31
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,678
Give it back to him, Hsiao Wen

32
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,684
What now?

33
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,955
Come on

34
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,003
Line up!

35
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,769
Boss, I only brought back a little bit

36
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,335
That's useless to me, no treats for you

37
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,103
But...

38
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,074
Next!

39
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,920
I've never seen this kind of paper money before

40
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,159
What's this?

41
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,956
l have done as you said

42
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,464
I stole it from that old man from America

43
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:09,424
Oh, then it's us. Dollars, great! You can have anything
you want.

44
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,805
Thanks boss

45
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,294
Next!

46
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,967
We made use of what you taught us and stole this

47
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,212
I stole it from a countryman

48
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,940
Now we can loosen our belts and eat till we're full.

49
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,450
Are you blind?

50
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:34,827
There are many traders and businessmen about, yet you
chose a countryman, It smells.

51
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,926
It's no surprise you've become so fat

52
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,637
you make the children steal, while you sit down all day

53
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,174
Then you reap all the benefits

54
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,664
What are you here for?

55
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,367
Give me back my money

56
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,179
What money?

57
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,376
You've got it in your hand

58
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,512
Do you have any proof?

59
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,177
Give it back, or I'll force you to

60
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,054
Out of the way now, let me deal with him

61
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,999
Let me show you some Kung fu today

62
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,366
Whoever learns, may have a chance to be my successor

63
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,963
I don't think you can compare with me

64
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,507
What do you mean by that?

65
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,235
l'll teach him a lesson, then you'll know for sure

66
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,050
You mean to insult me now?

67
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,682
Yes, I do

68
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,676
Your Kung Fu is not bad

69
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,313
Afraid now? Then give me the money

70
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,791
Me afraid? I've never known the feeling

71
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,487
Now watch!

72
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,899
What do you call that, boss?

73
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,935
It's called the Growling Tiger

74
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,693
Hey, careful of any damages

75
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,129
l'll smash everything up

76
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,943
You're pretty powerful

77
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,946
Well of course I am

78
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,426
No, you've missed me

79
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,695
You're pretty good, all you need now is a good teacher

80
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,729
Alright, I'll be the teacher

81
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,577
Look, Master is so great

82
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,687
So you like my Kung fu?

83
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,189
Look behind you Master!

84
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,191
What?

85
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,689
Boss has won again

86
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,455
How about that... powerful right?

87
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,355
Get up...

88
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,426
You won't accept my kindness?

89
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,368
Ok you don't need to give me my money

90
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,070
Don't smash up my placejust because you've lost?

91
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,414
You really mean it...

92
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,115
No no...

93
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,381
You...

94
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,823
That one is of precious value to my family, please don't
break it

95
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:02,657
You know what to do

96
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,889
l'll hand the money over

97
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,321
Pass it then

98
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,929
lt's shameful to do it in front of the children

99
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,301
What about the rest?

100
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,042
Oh, sorry I forgot

101
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,606
Is that all?

102
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,805
What more do you want?

103
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,445
How about the interest?

104
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,778
You want interest from me?

105
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:31,615
Alright, 2.5 °/o interest, is that enough

106
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,928
Master, you made an agreement with him?

107
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,264
He was afraid of me

108
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,228
Wh at!?

109
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,427
I said... you and..

110
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,403
Oh, it's all right never mind

111
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,601
This way...

112
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,934
Come back and visit when you want

113
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,444
You you payed him off

114
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,304
What?

115
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,815
You're saying I payed him? You must bejoking

116
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:04,212
You gave back the money that we got

117
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,724
Hey, you think I'm stupid

118
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,553
Look I have it here

119
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:32,278
Business hasn't been as quiet as today in years

120
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,515
What's going on, don't people cook?

121
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,354

Tell me, what's going on?

147
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,037
They're offering lottery tickets

148
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,937
This is ruining our business

149
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,270
This can't happen to me. What is it that they're offering?

150
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:08,575
The tickets are for ginseng, bars of gold, barbecue pork..

151
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,509
They're putting us out of business

152
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,966
I know what to do!

153
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,807
We'll mix their rice with sand

154
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,945
We could never do that

155
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,211
What is this?

156
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,015
Why is there so little?

157
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,388
What do you think, boss?

158
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,484
Stop there, I'll weigh it for you

159
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,690
Calm down

160
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:38,437
This is the wrong weight, they've cheated you

161
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,701
Go and get your money back

162
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,672
We want our money back...

163
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,884
Boss... My reward..

164
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,647
Oh, sorry, come in, welcome

165
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,358
Hi sir, come inside

166
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,367
Come on...

167
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,199
Come on then...

168
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,241
Take a seat, I'll bring you a girl

169
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,779
Quickly, you can'tjust stand around

170
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,344
You're supposed to be working

171
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,014
Get inside!

172
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,366
And where did they find you?

173
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,230
Are you going to just stand still?

174
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,662
Can I come closer?

175
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,335
Fist let me know if you have money

176
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,414
I wouldn't be here if I didn't have any

177
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,475
Let's see it then

178
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,280
There's no need to be looking down at me

179
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,184
Look at this!

180
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,466
I'm quite rich

181
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:53,469
In time, I'll be co-owner of the Wen Li Rice shop

182
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,534
Is that so? How could you be the co-owner?

183
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:05,475
That new Hang Chang rice shop will go out of business
since I played some tricks on them

184
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:09,812
So you'd better treat me well, and I'll treat you well

185
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:15,053
If not, I'll use my tricks on this place and put you out of
business too

186
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,218
You couldn't

187
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,129
What's going on?

188
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,794
You bastard, you tricked us

189
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,203
How dare you try to ruin our business

190
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,689
Stop that, you'll kill me

191
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,798
Sir

192
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,031
Yes, wait your tu rn

193
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,009
Excuse me, where's Ah Chu?

194
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,638
Don't even ask, I have no idea

195
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,808
If he has any money, he's probably at the brothel

196
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,682
He'll pick up a disease if he isn't careful

197
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:16,744
There you go

198
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,021
Sorryjust a minute

199
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,229
Sorry sir, but who is Ah Chu to you?

200
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,333
He's my broth er-inlaw

201
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,891
Oh, good that you came

202
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,760
You can help me out

203
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,799
Boss! Boss! You've got to help!

204
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,875
Sister!

205
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,477
Broth er!

206
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,811
Broth er!

207
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:43,783
What's happening?

208
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,616
Ah Chu is being bullied, you have to help him

209
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,448
Help me, help me

210
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,250
Someone get me down

211
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:55,282
Help me! Get me down...

212
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,728
Ah Chu, are you alright?

213
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,135
Get that man! Stop him fast!

214
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,699
Get out of here!

215
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,037
Go!

216
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,878
Brother, are you alright?

217
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:46,867
Wh ere's Ah Chu ?

218
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,878
He's sleeping in the room

219
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,415
Well we have to wake him up

220
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,450
Brother, what's the matter?

221
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,145
l have to question him

222
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,018
What is he doing fooling around when he has a nice wife
like you?

223
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:02,752
Don't say that brother, he's not like that

224
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,359
You should ask what he was doing yesterday?

225
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,297
He comes back late due to work at the shop

226
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:12,460
He has lots of work to do, but he's always at the brothel

227
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,730
What's th e matter?

228
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,106
Isn't it normal for a man to go to the brothel sometimes?

229
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,905
Don't be stupid

230
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,338
You're supposed to make sure he remains a good man

231
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,912
No need, I won't do it again

232
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,355
Brother, Ah Chu has admitted it

233
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:30,481
Will you forgive him?

234
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,451
Tell him you're sorry

235
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,059
Broth er, I apologise

236
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,165
You won't do it again...

237
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,227
Get up, brother has forgiven you

238
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,177
Brother, aren't you teaching Kung Fu in town?

239
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,236
How did you find the time to come and see us?

240
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,376
I haven't been teaching for months now

241
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,779
I had to close down

242
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,751
If you'd like, you can stay here with us

243
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,988
Thanks a lot, though I'll have to find ajob

244
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,520
For a strong young guy like you, you'd get ajob easily

245
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,427
You can find a job anywhere

246
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,893
Very good, th anks

247
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,308
Get them!

248
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,252
You'll push me out of business

249
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,719
What are you trying to do?

250
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,490
Stop there, we can discuss this

251
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,855
We'll get him too

252
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,299
What now?

253
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,425
Don't worry, I'm here

254
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,999
Come, let's go

255
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,468
Let them run away

256
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:47,890
I'm asking to tell me... Is there anyone who is eloquent,
active and can never lose a fight?

257
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,654
Yes

258
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,328
Who?

259
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,386
Thejudge is very Eloquent

260
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,731
The fists of Jackie Chan

261
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,755
The Legs of Bruce Lee

262
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,027
That's enough, where are they now?

263
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,665
Some have died, some have gone away

264
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:05,733
Nonsense, I'm asking you who we can use to beat the guy

265
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,641
Go and ask Uncle Hsien, his Kung fu is Marvelous

266
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,839
Where can we find him?

267
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,851
We can find him at the brothel

268
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:29,468
Please sit down, who do you want, sir?

269
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,163
Do you have someone you know?

270
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:38,198
Uncle Hsien? He's inside

271
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,141
Be quick

272
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,176
I'm coming

273
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,474
What are you looking at?

274
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,251
Go and get him

275
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:51,653
No way, I can't disturb him, he'll kill me

276
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,829
You shouldn't go in

277
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,456
Why?

278
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,565
There's a lady inside

279
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:07,194
Don't be impatient, just sit down and wait

280
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,943
Let's go in

281
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:20,114
You mustn't go in... Just wait a minute, there's one more
lady

282
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,751
Still another? He'll be weak, how can hefight?

283
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,322
He's coming out

284
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,767
You're uncle Hsien?

285
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,268
Yes, what's the matter?

286
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,701
I've come to ask for your help

287
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:45,833
Alright, fighting down others is a trade of mine

288
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:50,005
That's good, how much do you want?

289
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:57,215
You've come to visit me, we'll be friends from now on. I'll
take as much as you give me

290
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:02,449
That's good, I won't disappoint you

291
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,295
Wait!

292
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,568
Are you Uncle Hsien, sir?

293
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,303
Yes, I am

294
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,069
Nice to meet you

295
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,903
Hey, why did you hit me?

296
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,680
Who cares? I just did

297
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,773
You dare offend me? I'm Uncle Hsien

298
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,713
You're called Uncle Hsien too?

299
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:01,343
I'm called Hsien Ha, though I'm known as Uncle Hsien

300
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,014
Now who are you?

301
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:04,748
Tell me!

302
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:09,883
I'm called Hsien Ten, l'm known as Uncle Hsien too

303
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,789
What do you do?

304
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,595
What do you do then?

305
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,629
Just get out of here! Leave!

306
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,645
I've found you at last

307
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,907
I need your help

308
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,481
Shut up, I've heard the whole case

309
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:35,354
For cutting off a limb, Three Thousand

310
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,256
Six thousand for destroying his martial ability

311
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:39,019
Ten Thousand for his life

312
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,995
Alright, make him meet his end then

313
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:55,436
Brother, the Hang Chang restaurant has invited you to
come to dinner

314
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,108
They invited me to dinner?

315
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,007
Brother, you'd better be careful

316
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,344
Where is it?

317
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,470
In the Tai Pai Restaurant

318
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,793
Be careful, they may have made a plan

319
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,264
I think he's too scared to come anyway

320
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,962
Sorry, it has been reserved, come tomorrow

321
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,550
Sorry, you are...

322
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,280
Hang Chang invited me here

323
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,156
Here comes the guest

324
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,160
You're on time

325
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,194
I came as invited, so of course I'm on time

326
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,733
You're bold, please sit

327
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,403
We don't know each other

328
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,912
Why have you invited me?

329
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,848
I'm just here for money

330
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,546
Since you're here already, let's have a drink

331
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,589
Please

332
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,057
Please

333
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,898
Cheers!

334
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,869
You think highly of me?

335
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,507
You're the guest and I'm the host, I have to make the toast

336
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,736
Th en thank you

337
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,993
Too bad, it's too bad

338
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,159
You don't think the wine is good enough?

339
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,591
It's too bad we have wine and no meal

340
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,564
What would you like to eat then?

341
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,365
It depends on the Host's preferences

342
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,831
Ok, we'll have snake first

343
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,486
How do you like the taste of this snake fist?

344
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:45,292
Not bad, but it should be left to cook for longer

345
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,012
Not bad, but it should be left to cook for longer

346
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,122
Thank you for your snake fist

347
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,705
You let him go so easily

348
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,313
How about my money, give it back to me

349
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,871
Damnit, who'd give it back to you?

350
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:10,277
You guys, why are you still standing here?

351
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,778
What's that?

352
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,979
Give it back to me

353
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,654
I've told you many times, I don't mind if you couldn't catch
anything

354
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,485
But don't steal from me

355
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,851
Why won't you listen?

356
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,049
Boss, I didn't disobey you

357
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,956
lt's roasted pigeon

358
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,758
Roasted Pigeon?

359
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,636
It's fine

360
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,439
Delicious

361
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:53,256
Kid, you're young, but pretty fast

362
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,539
My bird!

363
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,944
You dirty brats!

364
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:33,226
That bird meant a lot to me but now you've killed it

365
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,198
l'll teach you!

366
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,298
Come here boy!

367
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,032
Master, I've got something for you so please don't punish
me as well

368
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,072
I didn't mean you...

369
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,188
Where did you get this?

370
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,052
A fat goat

371
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,659
That's no fat goat, the guy is a tiger

372
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,235
lt's ready, go ahead

373
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:32,320
Take it out

374
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,583
I haven't got it

375
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,318
Do you want to die?

376
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,622
Don't hurt him

377
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,924
Uncle 33

378
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,558
Feng I may, he's your kid?

379
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:49,705
How come my kid is... with you?

380
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,298
He stole my snuff bottle

381
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,036
You lost your snuff?

382
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,039
No one would dare to steal my things except you

383
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,953
You should have evidence before you accuse others

384
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,415
You work together, one plans and the other steals

385
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,925
You mean that l have your snuff?

386
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:13,396
I'm a man of experience, you can't deceive me

387
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:17,025
l've travelled around to a lot of places, and I've never let
anyone uncover a theft

388
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,692
That'd be shameful

389
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,270
There's an exception, right?

390
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:27,333
Let's make it clear, if you can't uncover it you must give
me face and let my kid go

391
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,971
How about if I find out?

392
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:34,517
If you find it, I'd submit totally and give this up forever

393
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,154
If I can't, we'll forget this ever happened

394
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,615
You said it yourself

395
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,488
I mean it, we're men

396
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,825
Come on

397
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,540
You'll lose face now

398
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,577
Too bad, it's not there

399
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,790
You're amazing, Fen I May

400
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,950
You've lost your thing, and now you've retrieved it

401
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:21,259
We made an agreement, you must give me face

402
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,432
Wait a minute

403
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,547
That was risky

404
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,980
Not so salty, it's delicious

405
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,749
That was a big risk since you were nearly caught

406
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,050
Why?

407
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,557
Don't you know? He's Uncle 33, since he killed 33 people

408
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:56,401
Although he's given up his trade, his character surely
hasn't changed

409
00:38:56,401 --> 00:39:01,361
If it was uncovered, you'd have become the 34th ghost

410
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:19,819
Master

411
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,958
No need to say, I know it all already

412
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,791
Why did you make trouble again?

413
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:36,307
l was paid to get rid of someone

414
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,901
But he defeated me

415
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,310
Do you know the consequence of your dealings?

416
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:47,543
If you cause trouble outside, you'll disrupt my plans

417
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,477
I fear that he'll interfere with us again

418
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,818
So I think you should deal with him your self

419
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,025
Wh o's there?

420
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,324
Who do you want?

421
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,961
Who do you want?

422
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,161
What are you doing?

423
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,594
Release me!

424
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,539
What are you doing?

425
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,548
Where's Wang Cheng?

426
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,052
I don't know

427
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:25,857
Tell me

428
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,188
I don't know

429
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,224
If you don't want to tell me, I'll make you tell me

430
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:49,369
Oh, my hand! My hand!

431
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,281
I'll tell you, I'll tell you

432
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,006
lt's you

433
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,239
l have to go to the toilet, excuse me

434
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,247
You haven't died yet, that's good

435
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,917
What are you doing?

436
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,315
Lesve now

437
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:09,117
But I have to use the bathroom first

438
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:13,730
Hey, do I have to beat you up for you to leave?

439
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:14,923
What are you saying?

440
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,468
You've already caused enough trouble beating up the last
QUV

441
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,038
Be smart and leave town, otherwise you'll die

442
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,403
It'd be difficult to settle down elsewhere

443
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,204
Why do I have to leave?

444
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,709
I'm just telling you the truth

445
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:28,903
Don't say I didn't warn you

446
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,881
You stay if you want, now let me use the toilet

447
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:32,845
Wait

448
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,924
You dogs!

449
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:51,462
Bastards, let go of me

450
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,569
Ah Chuan

451
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:06,907
Ah Chuan, Ah Chuan, why be so foolish?

452
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:18,191
Chuan, Ah Chuan! Ah Chuan...

453
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,668
Hey you, come out if you dare

454
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,807
It's this guy

455
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,349
You dare come here

456
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:50,327
Nobody dares to offend me in this town

457
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,656
But you've offended me, I'm Uncle 33

458
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,561
How did I offend you?

459
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,224
You've brought trouble to me

460
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,634
Let's see whether you caused it or I did

461
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,511
You're pretty bold to fight with me

462
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,508
Can you even beat me?

463
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,592
Don't get excited, it'sjust my clothes

464
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,439
Watch out, or I'll take your life

465
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,341
You're just scratching my itchy spots

466
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,546
I can kill you easily

467
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,034
Hey, we'll see how long you can stand

468
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:39,222
Watch my deadly Vital Eagle's Claw

469
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,234
Pretty cosy

470
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:57,314
Don't interfere this time, or I'll regard you as an enemy

471
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:03,514
When a monk eats dog meat, it doesn't make a difference
if it's once or twice

472
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,484
Stop thinking you're so skillful

473
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,354
We're both higly experienced

474
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,097
Fen, I know you're very capable

475
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,597
Though I have power on many levels

476
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:20,398
Either one or the other will lose in a battle, stop the talking

477
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,196
Give him one more chance and I'll never interfere again

478
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:27,845
Ok, but I have a condition

479
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,244
What kind of condition?

480
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,474
He has to leave immediately and he can never come back

481
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:34,982
Why do I have to leave?

482
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,550
Because of my Eagle's Claw

483
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:41,489
I won't leave, even if I can't beat you

484
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,758
You'll die if you fight

485
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:49,299
Why notjust leave?

486
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,833
I promise I'll tackle this problem

487
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:58,534
Fen, I'll give you face once more

488
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,569
If I see him next time, I won't let him escape

489
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:04,204
Go!

490
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:11,014
Stop that! You may be tough, but your Kung Fu isn't very
good at all

491
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,587
I don't think he's invincible

492
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,054
I won't leave just because he said

493
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,016
It's better avoid problems

494
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,354
Be patient, it'll save you trouble

495
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,293
Did you really think I came to go to the toilet?

496
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,263
I came to test your Kung Fu

497
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:26,499
If I didn't come, you would have died

498
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:34,776
Listen to me, just jeave quickly and don't try to be a hero

499
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,245
l have no relatives, where can I go?

500
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,986
Take this letter to Fen Yu Teng

501
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:45,945
In the Ching Ching Mountain, call for Monk Chio Wu, he'll
look after you

502
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,152
Let me say goodbye to my sister

503
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,496
No, you'll bump into Uncle 33 again

504
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,986
Go, go, leave quickly

505
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,565
l have to say goodbye face to face

506
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,463
Don't worry, l'll inform her of everything

507
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:53,223
What do you want? Say it quickly

508
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,954
l'm Wang Cheng, I've come to see Monk Chio

509
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,525
Are you the master?

510
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,358
I'm just a minor monk

511
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:04,958
But today I'm the outdoor supervisor

512
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:06,331
Supervisor?

513
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,536
I mean the guard

514
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,162
Understand ?

515
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,766
Do you have a diploma?

516
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:12,740
Diploma?

517
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:18,270
If you haven't, then sorry, you can't go in

518
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,007
l have to go in, I don't need permission

519
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,378
Stop th ere!

520
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,518
I warn you, you need my permission to get in

521
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:30,291
Even if you're the King, you can't get in no matter what

522
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,892
l have a letter

523
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:35,163
Supervisor, please take me to see the Abbot

524
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,128
Are you deaf?

525
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,934
Don't you hear the chanting?

526
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:40,436
The Abbot is busy now, come later

527
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,231
I won't leave until I've seen the abbot

528
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,504
Come on, he's busy right now

529
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:02,059
A good deed a day will take you to heaven

530
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,653
Ok, let me take you there

531
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,296
Stand here, wait till I come back

532
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:10,866
Stay back

533
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:15,797
They know I haven't permitted you

534
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,033
If you run in and the guards catch you, you'll be sorry

535
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,409
Master

536
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,215
Master, Master...

537
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,625
This is the temple, you can't yell here

538
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,165
I came to visit and he said he'll take me around

539
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:17,893
But hejust came here to eat instead

540
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:20,993
Hsuan Chi

541
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,035
Brother

542
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,071
Is it true what he said?

543
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,472
Dinner was laid out already

544
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,275
l was going to do it after I finished

545
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,851
The Abbot said that since you're alone

546
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:40,083
And you have no place to stay, we must be kind

547
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,682
You can stay here if you want

548
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:47,624
Don't get too excited, pay attention

549
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:51,535
Buddhist monks are never violent

550
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:55,130
So if you break the rules and fight, you must leave

551
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,330
Merciful Buddha

552
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:02,635
l'm responsible for all your actions from now on, so you'd
better obey me

553
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,212
Listen!

554
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:07,743
It's time for you to show your abilities

555
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,652
This should be the easy part

556
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,949
Hurry up

557
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,121
I'll put you to the test now

558
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,857
But we won't be doing Kung Fu for now

559
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,732
Drop this here

560
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:29,268
You're going to have to distribute the seeds

561
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:34,868
If the birds make a mess, you'll have to clean it all up

562
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,674
What about you?

563
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,576
It depends on how you cope

564
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:39,238
What?

565
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,645
You dare to argue with me?

566
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,017
You w on't obey?

567
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,180
Want to rule me?

568
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,380
Get moving!

569
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,859
Why?

570
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:52,961
There's a cloud... Nothing to see!

571
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,927
Get moving!

572
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,169
Stan d th ere

573
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,600
Is that comfortable?

574
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,466
Ok

575
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:17,845
The cloud is here, come over

576
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,931
Wait, the wind is blowing, move this way

577
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:03,758
You can never move me no matter how hard you try

578
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,715
Wait till there's no wind

579
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,454
Dry it in the sun

580
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,006
Look at you

581
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,065
The top of your the is heavy and the lower is light

582
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,633
If you your legs aren't firm, then of course you'll fall down

583
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,352
Why do you strike the bell?

584
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:05,219
You're mad, why are you striking it

585
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,822
Let it go, you can't strike the bell as you please

586
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:15,732
You've made a big mistake, wait and see

587
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:18,163
Brother, you'd better tell him

588
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:20,763
Release him

589
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,200
I've been here for three months, yet I haven't seen the
Abbot yet

590
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:32,749
He has been secluded since the day you came

591
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,281
I don't care, I must see the Abbot

592
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:30,270
Has he obeyed the regulations since he came?

593
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,175
He was striking the bell just a little earlier

594
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,574
He doesn't behave like a monk

595
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,076
But his legs get stronger everyday

596
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,178
Strengthening my legs...

597
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:45,254
You can never move me no matter how hard you try

598
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:50,494
Master, should we put him to the test now?

599
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:50,926
Master, should we put him to the test now?

600
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,997
No, it's not the right time, he still needs improvement

601
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,123
What should we do in the next step Master?

602
00:58:57,234 --> 00:59:00,533
Developing one's Kung Fu requires many practices

603
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:01,626
Watch

604
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,534
Reach out the arms

605
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:08,669
Attack the vital points

606
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:18,886
Defend

607
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,621
Stren gth en your arms

608
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,417
Strengthen your legs too

609
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,757
Why would he need to do that?

610
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,868
It's better to use one powerful kick than 10 weak ones

611
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,643
I understand now

612
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:47,649
You must take advantage of others' weak points

613
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,843
We stop here today

614
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,716
Master, you've practiced the Monkey Pole for very long
now

615
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,381
Why don't you show us?

616
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:56,287
Merciful Buddha

617
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,320
Learning Kung Fu requires patience, we'll do more
practice tomorrow

618
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,842
Buddha's name be praised

619
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,519
Please

620
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,456
You're not dead yet?

621
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,253
I won't die until you do

622
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,351
You want to die then, get him

623
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,867
I told you to kick him out

624
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:41,129
Why is he still here, tell him to go!

625
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,140
He has no relatives out there, it's pitiful

626
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,472
Uncle Hsien, you're generous, please let him be

627
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,702
Careful you fool, I won't be so merciful next time

628
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:52,873
You're still making trouble here, get away!

629
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,951
Please sit down Uncle Hsien

630
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:02,317
Wait a while, Ah Lien will be free soon

631
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,393
Ok, it's alright

632
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,157
Please relax, make yourselves at home

633
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:16,628
Ah Chiu

634
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:20,268
Lien, what's the matter?

635
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,139
What's the matter... Go change the water

636
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,592
What's the matter... you feel ashamed?

637
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,456
You deal with the water to make a living

638
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:49,465
Why aren't you listening?

639
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:50,904
Want to hit me now?

640
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,202
Why don't you try?

641
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,879
Such a fool

642
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,473
He should measure his ability first

643
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,147
Don't pay attention to him

644
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,875
He can't do anything anyway

645
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:04,777
Release him

646
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,730
With your behavior, you deserve this

647
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,065
You want to mess up my business?

648
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,726
If you're not willing to work then leave

649
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:21,026
Get out! Just get out!

650
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,733
I'll get you today

651
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:44,349
Ok, I'll deal with you today

652
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,052
The Monkey Stick

653
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,263
The Elephant strike

654
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:00,958
Back to the centre

655
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:05,770
Holding at bay

656
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:10,980
Th e sn ake attack

657
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,016
The bee sting

658
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:21,714
Turning aside

659
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,324
Turn back and grasp

660
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,037
I caught you this time

661
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,069
Practicin g Ku ng Fu

662
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:40,937
go back

663
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,044
Brother, you've gone far

664
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,544
Come back with me to see the abbot

665
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:04,830
You dare to beat me?

666
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,394
You'll regret it this time

667
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:13,776
You told lies about taking me to the abbot

668
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,874
Do you want to be the Uncle 32?

669
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,207
Uncle 32?

670
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,180
The one who dies before Uncle 33

671
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,155
Help! Help Master!

672
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,140
Help!

673
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:47,433
Help!

674
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,809
Stop Wan g Ch eng!

675
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:20,901
You're rude

676
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,069
You've forgotten our regulations

677
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,943
l have to put an end to this game played on me

678
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,852
You've destroyed the game of chess

679
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,410
Buddha will be angry

680
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:31,521
Give me the pole

681
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:32,180
Yes

682
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:36,256
Master, why didn't you see me until now?

683
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:39,851
You still can't read any Buddhist sutras

684
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,090
I haven't come here for ungodliness

685
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,564
There are just many villains out there for me to deal with

686
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:48,297
I must punish Hsuan Chi first, give way, Master

687
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,033
It's the attitude of the common man

688
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,164
To beat anyone that interrupts him

689
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,768
Come on, just fight me as if I was Uncle 33

690
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:00,934
l un derstand

691
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,564
That just means you don't understand

692
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,068
Master, here's the pole, beat him

693
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:14,182
You've learnt much of my Kung Fu

694
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:17,377
Though you may not be able to beat Uncle 33's Plum
Blossom Pole

695
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:27,355
Be careful, he uses the pole very well

696
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,021
He endures many fights

697
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,827
Even if wounded he wouldn't lose

698
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,262
Plum Blossom and the Dragon comes

699
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,705
From the eastern sea

700
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,131
The Mon key Stick!

701
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:40,869
The Elephant strike!

702
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,605
Friends meet in the cold weather

703
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:53,448
The cotton is revealed

704
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,910
Turn back and grasp

705
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,315
Gust of wind blows away the leaves

706
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:26,246
lncense facing the sky

707
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:30,415
Silly fool, avoid the heavy part and concentrate on the
lighter

708
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:34,054
Avoid the heavy part and concentrate on the light side?

709
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,826
Thanks!

710
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,042
Prodigal doesn't return, there's no way for him to get home

711
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,821
Ask for rain in the mountain

712
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,290
Turn back and kill the dragon

713
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:15,966
lnvite th e Goddess

714
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:20,298
The aftermath of a disaster

715
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,559
The flowers fade and fall

716
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,334
You deserve what you have in life

717
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,927
And don't ask for what you don't deserve

718
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,199
I don't intend to keep you here...

719
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,468
Since you have no interest in our teachings

720
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:58,104
You have learned my Kung fu but you have no relation to
Buddha, you can leave

721
01:11:58,281 --> 01:12:03,981
Master, thank you for your kindness

722
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,785
Merciful Buddha

723
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,427
Master Hsuan Chi

724
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:19,933
Th ank you

725
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:32,864
NEIL BATEMAN

726
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:35,135
ls Chiu here?

727
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:38,981
No Chiu here, but there's eggs... How many do you want?

728
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:40,073
Sorry

729
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:54,161
Currently, the food trade business on depends on four
main figures

730
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,724
I want to talk with them myself

731
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,261
I'll come back in half a month

732
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,095
I'll leave everything to you

733
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:07,436
Master, don't worry, even the Heng Chuan shop is ours

734
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:10,137
Once we've taken over these other four businesses

735
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:13,113
We'd have monopolized the market

736
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,678
How about guy with the mill in the east village?

737
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,418
He's difficult to tackle

738
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,887
He says he won't let anything go

739
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,133
How much stock is there?

740
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:39,173
400 bags of grain. 100 bags of Barely, 90 bags of rice. 100
bags of wheat, about 700 bags in total

741
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,570
Tell the men to call for him immediately

742
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,013
If he doesn't sell at the price I give, then deal with him like
we did with the Heng Chuan

743
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:48,948
Force him to close

744
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:57,656
Boss...

745
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,190
So you did come back

746
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:05,295
Don't leave yet!

747
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,040
I need to go somewhere, wait till I come back

748
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,396
Don't fight, there's enough

749
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,772
Come now, there's enough for everyone

750
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:04,626
Why did you come back again?

751
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:06,661
Did Monk Chio Wu treat you badly?

752
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:09,026
No, he treated me kindly

753
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:16,195
Do you know where my sister and my brother-in-law is?

754
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,703
Your sister, sh e...

755
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:21,073
What happened to her?

756
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,180
She's dead

757
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:29,178
Dead? How did she die?

758
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:33,346
It was said that Uncle 33 and his disciple made her
commit suicide

759
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,595
How about my brother-in-law?

760
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,255
I haven't seen him in a long time

761
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:53,041
lt's you

762
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,878
So you finally came back to die?

763
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:03,574
We'll see whether it's you or me who dies

764
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:09,422
Don't forget that my Master has already beaten you

765
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:19,801
Who got my sister killed?

766
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,472
Was it you that forced her to die?

767
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,870
No, not me

768
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,515
Go

769
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,452
Go

770
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,193
Go

771
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:50,329
Go!

772
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,053
Did you kill my sister?

773
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:31,729
It wasn't me, It was my master's doing

774
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:39,170
Where's your master now

775
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:23,215
Why did you get my sister killed?

776
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,787
It's not my business, ask my Master

777
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:30,623
Wh ere's your Master?

778
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:31,621
I don't know

779
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:32,692
You don't know?

780
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:34,826
Do you know now?

781
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:36,622
Do you know now?

782
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:38,590
Where is he?

783
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:41,335
I don't know

784
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,470
I don't know

785
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,309
What are you doing?

786
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,282
Release me! Release me!

787
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:01,185
Release me! Release me!

788
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,825
Release me!

789
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:10,627
Lets see if you'll talk or not

790
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:17,597
Will you talk?

791
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:29,810
Will you talk?

792
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:33,044
I'll tell you... I'll tell you... I'll tell you...

793
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:37,750
My Master has gone down town

794
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:47,230
Wait! Let me down! Let me down!

795
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:53,230
I'll let you have a slow death

796
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,502
Release me! Release me!

797
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:24,737
Master, help me, help me!

798
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:26,031
Help you?

799
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,741
That was a big mistake you just made

800
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:33,143
You're my disciple, you should know I don't tolerate failure

801
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:36,317
And you even told him where l was going?

802
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:50,255
You've actually given me a helping hand here

803
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,228
At least I've seen his Kung Fu

804
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:56,438
And I know why he's looking for me

805
01:22:56,438 --> 01:23:00,340
Alright, you're clever, but I'm not foolish

806
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:03,904
You never expected me to come back, did you?

807
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:07,008
You don't like your life?

808
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:09,640
You've already helped change my title to Uncle 34

809
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:12,448
Now you'll give me the title Uncle 35

810
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:16,787
Before you become Uncle 35, I think you'll be dead

811
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,642
You have your Plum Blossom Pole

812
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,233
But I have my Monkey Pole

813
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:49,578
Let me see your Monkey Pole then

814
01:25:55,917 --> 01:26:00,149
My pole will destroy your vital points

815
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,920
Avoid the heavy part and concentrate on the light side

816
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:09,687
Alright, I'll do it

817
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:41,355
You know the Eagle's Claw?

818
01:27:42,057 --> 01:27:45,993
You killed my sister, now you'll pay for it

819
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,158
How did you learn my Eagles Claw?

820
01:29:00,802 --> 01:29:04,238
It's called an Eye for an Eye, a tooth for a tooth

821
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:25,322
Root up the stone of 1000 catties

822
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:58,259
Is that all?

823
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:00,527
No, there's more

824
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,010
You really think you can beat me?

825
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:28,519
You think you're invincible, but you're just another rascal

826
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:33,461
If you want to die, that's fine

827
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:34,928
Captu ring Tiger!

828
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:40,764
Grasping like a flying dragon

829
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,508
Capture of the blowing wind

830
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:18,665
Ambushing eagle draws close

831
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,384
Hungry tiger doesn't leave

832
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,278
You must bear it

833
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:08,754
Those men beat your brother-in-law to death

834
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,201
Take advantage of his weaknesses

835
01:32:48,363 --> 01:32:52,663
You learnt from Ohio Wu to take advantage of
weaknesses

836
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:55,694
Too late to realize now!

837
01:33:29,838 --> 01:33:41,602
Wait there

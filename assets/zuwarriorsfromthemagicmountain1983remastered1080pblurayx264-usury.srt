<i>Mount Zu:</i>

2
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,894
<i>The collective name of a mountain range
found in the west of China in Pa-Shu,</i>

3
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,229
<i>otherwise known today as Sichuan.</i>

4
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:08,778
<i>Pa-Shu played an extremely significant
role in ancient military strategy.</i>

5
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,738
<i>Thus, the ancient proverb states:</i>

6
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,990
<i>'For there to be chaos under heaven,
there must first be chaos in Shu.</i>

7
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,493
<i>'When all has been conquered under heaven,
Shu will remain unconquered.'</i>

8
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,537
<i>Within both mythology and folklore,</i>

9
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,208
<i>another face to Pa-Shu is revealed,
one full of mystery and wonder,</i>

10
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,252
<i>derived from its mountain's many
strange peaks and ancient temples.</i>

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>Therefore, tales abound of
celestial swordsmen and heroic divinities,</i>

12
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,675
<i>culminating in the legends of the
heroic swordsman of Zu Mountain.</i>

Scout Ti Ming-Chi greets
the left and right commanders.

24
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:46,041
- Where are the Yellow Banner remnants now?
- Report, Left Commander.

25
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,253
The Yellow Banner has fallen,
the Eastern Shu army fled for their lives.

26
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,423
Your subordinate observed them fleeing
to San-Chang Brook in the foothills.

27
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,174
As it should be.

28
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,511
When we take them on the water,
their corpses will line the riverbed!

29
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,389
Report, Left Commander.
The Yellow Banner is already routed.

30
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,558
There are many civilians
along San-Chang Brook.

31
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,351
A direct attack will harm innocents.

32
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,312
If that is so, we shall take them on land.

33
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,523
Find a path immediately.
I want to end their nation and bloodlines!

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,067
- This soldier understands!
- It is long and winding by land.

35
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,277
The risks are too great.

36
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,487
Ti Ming-Chi, lead the way now!

37
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,698
I want to pursue them on water.
We go by water!

38
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:18,741
No!

39
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,702
Going by water is too slow,
allowing the enemy time to escape.

40
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,704
We shall pursue them on land.
We go by land!

41
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:24,872
Nonsense!

42
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,207
- We go by water!
- We go by land!

43
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,375
We go by water!

44
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,336
Ti Ming-Chi, who will you obey?

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,755
This soldier obeys both.

46
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,423
Obeying both is insubordination!

47
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,758
I'll have your head!

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,426
Then I won't obey either!

49
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,594
Your head, then!

50
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,054
Kill!

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,097
My two commanders,
that's not what I meant!

52
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,099
Stand down.
We're on the same side!

00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,020
Boatman, take me across the river.

00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,855
I... can't...

56
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,232
Why not?

57
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,693
- The blade at my back says I can't.
- Boatman, get down!

58
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,157
- Western Shu?
- Eastern Shu?

59
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,119
Western Shu, this here's the
middle o' nowhere, not a battlefield.

60
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,246
- Right! Put away <i>yer</i> blade, then.
- You first!

61
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,747
- You first!
- Me last!

My good <i>fellers,</i>
do you have to be so cranky?

63
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,628
I'll count backwards from three.

64
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,715
You jump aside, sheath your blades,
and we're all good! Alright, ready!

65
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,216
Thr...

66
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,510
Ya said you weren't gonna fight!

67
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,805
Of the five generations of my clan,
Eastern Shu killed four. I'll avenge them!

68
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,852
So what? Six generations of my clan
were wiped out by Western Shu.

69
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,895
- How d'ya repay that debt?
- How? With a blade!

70
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,606
Me life's tougher than any blade.
We'll do it yer way, then!

71
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,030
I chop! I chop! I chop!

72
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,406
I block! I block! I block!

73
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,408
- I chop, chop, chop!
- I block, block, block!

74
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,827
Chop, block, chop, block,
chop, chop, block!

75
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,630
You're in for a treat...
My reinforcements are here.

76
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,383
How d'ya know they're yers?
Why can't they be mine?

77
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,845
Easy, we just take a look at
the colour of the arrows.

78
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,096
Grab an arrow, then.

81
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,105
Ya didn't even take one,
how d'ya know what colour it is?

82
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,524
You have to take one?
You can tell just by touching it!

83
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,693
Don't believe me?
Take a look, then.

84
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,154
Alright... but you first!

85
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,699
It's neither.

86
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,705
- It's yellow!
- Dang, yellow!

87
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,332
- Bow or stern?
- The back!

88
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,754
- Seize them and bring them here!
- Aye!

89
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,813
Steady on!

90
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,065
All these years of fightin'
have made me numb.

91
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,651
I don't wanna fight ya anymore.
I'm goin' now.

92
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,371
Hey!

00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,957

- 'Hey' what?

95
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,502
I said I'm done! I'm done! I'm done!

96
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,004
'Done' your stupid fat head!
Your water flask!

97
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,843
It really is my water flask!

98
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,472
Hey, you alright?

99
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,474
Why are you so big
but your guts so small?

100
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:16,228
Ye're one to talk. With that grim face
o' yers, I can't tell if ye're good or bad!

Hey!

102
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,566
So, where 'bouts ya from?

103
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,610
I'm from the village left of San-Li-Pu
on the eastern border of Nan-An.

104
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,737
That right? I'm from those parts too.

105
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,406
But I'm from the village on the right.

106
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,616
No wonder you looked so familiar!

107
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,451
You're actually pretty good company.

108
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,911
O' course I'm good company.

109
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,415
Apart from the colour of me clothes,
I'm just the same as you.

110
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,001
The world's such a mess now

111
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,712
all 'cause the country's not fer people,
and the people not fer country.

112
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,008
Here and now, we're good company,
but it ain't so dandy on the battlefield.

113
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,431
Kill!

114
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,057
It's happenin' again!

115
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,019
Charge!

116
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,730
Kill!

117
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,732
Kill!

118
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,193
A rainbow flurry means a rainbow melee!

119
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,653
Forget the colours!

120
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,323
We'll put on an act fer now,
give 'em somethin' to gawk at!

121
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,000
Why're ya fer real?

122
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,003
I said put on an act!

123
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,963
Why're ya tryin' so hard?

124
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,384
- Hey, should we keep fighting?
- You watch the front, me the back.

125
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,637
- Wait fer a chance to get outta here.
- Let's go, then!

126
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,855
Ya stupid-head, is this any time
to show off? Let's go!

127
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,906
Yer being too hard, stupid-head!
Hey—

128
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,744
That was effective.

129
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,955
Hey, fatty!

130
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,290
I'm over here!

131
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,543
Don't ya worry! I'm a-coming!

132
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,798
It's the three of us against one of him!

133
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,970
Hey, what's this? We're on the same side!
Get 'im! Get 'im! Get 'im!

134
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,180
It's six of us against the three of them!

135
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,560
Why're ya just standin' there?

136
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,438
It's nine of us against the six of them!

137
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,733
It's all of us against one of him!

138
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,905
Kill!

139
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,743
Hey, let's go!

140
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,288
Hey, let's play dead.

141
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,750
Don't move. They'll sort 'emselves out.

142
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,961
Hey, how long do you think they'll go for?

143
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,379
I think they're almost done.

144
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,799
Yer all playin' dead?

145
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,387
Yellow again! Let's get outta here!

146
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,564
There's still one in red and one in blue!

147
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,024
Don't let them get away!

148
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,608
After them!

149
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,491
Brother, go on ahead.
I'll take it from here.

150
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,702
No way! This is life and death.
How can I ditch you?

151
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,330
- What kind of brother is that?
- Come on! One death is better than two!

152
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,914
- Just go!
- I'm staying!

153
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,333
Go already!

154
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,169
Who pushed ya down there?

155
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,477
Mother!

156
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,938
Save me!

157
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,891
Hey, my saviour!
My saviour, don't rush off.

158
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,313
You wish to say something to me?

159
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,399
Great Hero, you must know that
the world is sinking as it burns.

160
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,318
The chaos of war,
existence is misery.

161
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,321
Great Hero, with your peerless
martial arts you must save mankind!

162
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,615
This tumultuous world of man,
therewhile exist eleven kingdoms.

163
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,159
Mankind live out lives plagued by turmoil.

164
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,162
However, they only have
themselves to blame.

165
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,414
They kill one another,

166
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,583
treating human lives
like grass beneath their feet.

167
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,793
What utter nonsense!

168
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,171
Neither you or I have the ability
to bring about change.

169
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,214
The hearts of man are so corrupt.

170
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,008
While you still have a conscience,

171
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,636
seek refuge in the mountains
and leave behind the world of man.

172
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,095
Great Hero, why say such things?

173
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,265
As long as everyone puts in the effort,
peace can be restored under heaven.

174
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,809
Youth is truly formidable.
Even lecturing me...

175
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,145
Alas, time is not on your side.

176
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,357
If you don't leave this place,
you will become just like them.

177
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,331
Great Hero? Great Hero?

178
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,958
Great Hero?

179
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,840
Great Hero? Great Hero?

180
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,344
Great Hero...?

181
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,772
Great Hero...?

182
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,027
<i>These great heroes usually
move in mysterious ways.</i>

183
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,071
<i>He must be testing me.</i>

184
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,700
<i>Alright, then! I won't stop waiting
till he shows up!</i>

185
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,936
You're finally here!

186
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,564
You were waiting for me?
Don't be stupid!

187
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,108
In such a dangerous place,
only the King of Hell is waiting!

188
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,276
The King of Hell?

189
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,195
Right! No wonder there's
so many skulls here!

190
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,864
There must've been a battle here once!

191
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,367
Not a battle. All these skulls bear the
mark of the Demon Cult.

192
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,246
In order to practise their evil sorcery,
they sacrifice so many children.

193
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,664
These are all virgin bones.

194
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,001
- Virgin bones...?
- Now you know why I told you to leave.

195
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,003
Is it because I'm a virgin?

196
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,630
How lucky...

197
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,424
You're wrong.

198
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,511
Whether you're a virgin or not,
these demonic sorcerers won't spare you.

199
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,723
And though you claim to be a virgin,
nobody will believe that.

200
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,350
So?

201
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,935
Why did you wait for me?

202
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,854
I want you to take me as your disciple.

203
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,230
I have always walked alone.

204
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,191
As of today,
let's change your bad habit!

205
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,358
Master!

206
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,322
Master? Master?

207
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,700
- Master...?
- I am not your master!

208
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,869
Teach me martial arts,
and once I've mastered it

209
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,371
I can fight oppression, help the weak,
and save the masses!

210
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,915
I will not take you as a disciple!

211
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,709
Master...? Master...? Ma—

212
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,336
Call me again and I will disappear!

213
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,088
I— I'll shut up! I'll shut up!
You can come out now!

214
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,891
A blood crow! Take that!

215
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,900
Above the Ninth Heaven,
the stars appear!

216
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,912
The wheel of the bright moon
shrouds the cosmos!

217
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,000
De... De... De... De... De... De...

218
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,169
You can stop with the 'De'.
They're with us.

219
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,309
Hsiao-Yu of Tibetan-Kun-Lun.

220
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,062
Ting Yin of the South Sea.

221
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:07,730
Ting Yin.

222
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,107
Zen Master Hsiao-Yu.

223
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,277
- So your surname's Ting!
- What's it to you?

224
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,529
Scholar, our ten year engagement has come.

225
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,281
Are you also here to meet Long Brows?

226
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,575
Monk...

227
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,953
He was afraid this would be too much
for you and asked me to lend you a hand.

228
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,913
Just two crows and
you're jumping at shadows.

229
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,374
How can you defeat the
Blood Demon's guardians like this?

230
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,293
Dammit! I Amitā your Buddha!

231
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,546
The Blood Demon grows more aggressive
each day, so we need to join forces.

232
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,464
What say you?

233
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,387
A monastic displays compassion,
delivering all from hardship.

234
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,139
The Demon Cult spread their wickedness
from the Stone Forest Temple.

235
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,100
This fills Buddha with burning rage,
let alone I, Hsiao-Yu?

236
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,351
These past three years,

237
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,646
my idiot disciple and I come and go
from Ching-Tsang to trace their movements.

238
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,899
To think that I would run into you today.

239
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,318
The demonic qi here is strong.

240
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,778
It seems it's nothing as simple
as just a few sorcerers.

241
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,072
Hey, what's the plan?

242
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,741
You ask too much!

243
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,785
My philosophy has always been:
Share a table at dinner, meditate alone!

244
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,621
- Walk your own path!
- You never change!

245
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,456
- I walk to my own beat, you walk to yours!
- I walk to my own beat, you walk to yours!

246
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,957
- I-Chen?
- Master!

247
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,626
- Virgin?
- Great hero!

248
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,835
- We enter the temple!
- Aye!

249
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,003
Enter the temple.

250
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,091
What kind of person is this monk?

251
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,178
He is a most impulsive person.

252
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,347
Hey, friend?

253
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,891
Virgin?

254
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,267
You calling me?

255
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,561
- Do you want to take a look inside?
- Sure!

256
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,571
- I-Chen, over here!
- Yes, Master!

257
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,542
Damn scholar, stand aside!
I can't keep an eye on you!

258
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,378
Short-haired monk,
keep an eye on yourself!

259
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,171
Eating vegetarian gives you weak arms!

260
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,547
Amitābha. Dammit!

261
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,429
Master?

262
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,648
Watch out!

263
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,840
Let's go!

264
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,365
Guardians of the Demon Cult,
welcome their distinguished guests!

265
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,410
Hey, how'd you get up there?

266
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,704
Kid's stuff. Just watch the show.

267
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,084
Monk, it's so dangerous here,
why'd you come down?

268
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,503
Even if you didn't rile me up,
I'd still come help you!

269
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,505
Who are you, distinguished guests,

270
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,632
that dare trespass
the altar of the Demon Cult?

271
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,885
We're the type who knowingly
walk into a tiger's den!

272
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,553
We're obviously not common people.

273
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,388
We come in heaven's name
to mete out righteousness!

274
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,223
Who are these people?

275
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,727
They're bad, we're good. Get it?

276
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,479
The doctrine of our Demon Cult:

277
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,314
<i>- Those who come in heaven's name: Kill!</i>
- Kill!

278
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,191
<i>- Those who smite evil for justice: Kill!</i>
- Kill!

279
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,151
<i>- Those who protect all life: Kill!</i>
- Kill!

280
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,737
<i>- Those who oppose our Demon Cult: Kill!</i>
- Kill!

281
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,198
Who don't you kill, then?

282
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,620
<i>Those who believe in me: Do not kill.</i>

283
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,830
Monk, you think you can
win them over with words

284
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,457
and spare ourselves a fight tonight?

285
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,835
Save your breath
so you can still put up a fight at least!

286
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,379
That's right.

287
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,883
Damn scholar, I'll let you leave here
in one piece—a corpse!

288
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,531
Put it out with water!

289
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,782
It's really strong!

290
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,701
I can't take it!

291
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,980
Monk, do you need a hand?

292
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:29,779
Return!

293
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,390
Return!

294
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,730
Hey? What are you waiting for?

295
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,488
Take this!

296
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,014
I never would've thought our years
of hard work would fall short of success.

297
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,267
Great Master, it's all my fault.
If it wasn't for—

298
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,144
Young brother, don't be hard on yourself.

299
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,562
That's right, young benefactor.

300
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,815
It was a heavenly blessing that you
managed to escape calamity today!

301
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,320
Monk? When will we receive
a heavenly blessing and meet again, then?

302
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,572
You don't get a heavenly blessing!

303
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,282
Let us never meet again.

304
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:59,368
If it wasn't for you, would those
demon monsters have gotten away today?

305
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,413
You really don't make any sense,
what complete nonsense.

306
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,749
Fine! If that's how it is...

307
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,792
Heaven, earth, north, south:
Take your pick.

308
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,337
The moon is in alignment tonight.
I'll head up north.

309
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,880
Then I'll head down south.

310
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,506
Very well. From this moment onwards,

311
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,883
- may our paths never cross!
- may our paths never cross!

312
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,134
I Amitā your Buddha!

313
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,178
- I-Chen?
- Yes?

314
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,346
We're leaving!

315
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,809
Soldier Boy?

316
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,853
You take care now.

317
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,480
May our paths cross again!

318
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,703
Great Hero?

319
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:43,954
Great Hero...?

320
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,290
Great Hero...?

321
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,252
Great Hero? Great Hero...?

322
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,426
He's disappeared again...
He doesn't take me seriously at all!

323
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:03,724
I ask you to save mankind,
and you all leave without saying a word!

324
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,976
Why did you even learn kung fu, then?

325
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,270
Like turtles hiding in their shells!

326
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:11,565
No wonder the world is in absolute chaos
and devilry runs rampant.

327
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,528
'They only have themselves to blame'?
You're responsible too!

328
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,407
The heavens are great, the earth is great—
But I'm the greatest!

329
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,659
I don't need any of you!

330
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,119
I'll take care of it myself!

331
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,081
You lot... Don't ever come back again!

332
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,426
You're all back?

333
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,556
We said our paths would never cross.
Why do we meet again?

334
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,183
We said you'd head north
and I'd head south.

335
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,686
You switched directions without saying
a word. What's the point telling me now?

336
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,355
Why are you still talking?
He's already sucked up our weapons!

337
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:52,606
Hurry up with a plan!

338
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,111
- What's happening?
- Don't know.

339
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,781
But in all my years following my master,
I've never seen him so nervous.

340
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,141
Hey, what's happening out there?

341
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:17,608
Unsheathe!

342
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,620
- Great Master.
- Master!

343
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:37,878
Return!

344
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,218
Let's go!

345
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,150
Monk?

346
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,152
We've never worked together before.

347
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,238
I never imagined our first meeting
would be a catastrophe.

348
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,406
Quiet now.

349
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,491
- What are you doing?
- I'm transferring true qi to you!

350
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,077
- You're making jokes at a time like this?
- Making jokes?

351
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,787
I can't even joke if you want me to!

352
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,872
I-Chen! Your martial uncle's gone insane!

353
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,332
Don't let him do it!

354
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,337
- I-Chen!
- Master?

355
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,839
- Tell him to stop!
- Martial Uncle?

356
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,757
If we don't heal your master now,
he'll be in grave danger!

357
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,384
- Master?
- You're not listening to your own master?

358
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,386
- Martial Uncle?
- Silly boy, you're still kneeling about?

359
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,263
Keep watch outside
with this young brother here.

360
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,181
- Holler if anything happens!
- Ting Yin!

361
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,186
The Blood Demon will use this chance
to attack us, you fool! I-Chen?

362
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:37,730
Get out!

363
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,897
Come back!

364
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,149
Get out!

365
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,066
Come back!

366
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,318
Get out!

367
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,154
Hey, where'd that monk I-Chen go?

368
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,112
You better not show yourself!

369
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,766
A hero came to my rescue again?

370
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,811
That can't be right...
I've always been so unlucky.

371
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:04,066
Hey!

372
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,069
Why am I stuck?
What is this stuff...?

373
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,737
Hey! Who the hell are you?

374
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,368
I am the founding ancestor of Mount O-Mei:
Long Brows!

375
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,253
The founding ancestor of Mount O-Mei?
What the hell are you doing here?

376
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,547
How could I not make an appearance
at a time like this?

377
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:27,881
Are you good or evil?

378
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,425
I'm good, of course!

379
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,010
Would a bad guy wear white?
Take a closer look!

380
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,139
Don't touch my beard—

381
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,850
How come it's on me now?

382
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,185
Don't touch my beard!

383
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,895
- What now?
- You're still touching...?

384
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,398
Don't touch it!

385
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,446
- Kid?
- You calling me?

386
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,865
It's not like I'm calling myself.
Grab two rocks for me.

387
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,576
- Here.
- Bigger ones!

388
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,329
Follow me!

389
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,834
Throw them when I tell you to.

390
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,919
You better not throw them
before I tell you to!

391
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,230
You so-called righteous people.

392
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,024
Your foundations have yet to take root.

393
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,526
Thus, you are at the mercy of me,
the Blood Demon!

394
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,529
This monk has been tainted by
my Blood Demon venom.

395
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,989
Within ten days,

396
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,159
as the poisoned blood pollutes his heart,
he will lose his mind as I enter into him.

397
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,829
At which point, he will become
the new vessel for the Blood Demon!

398
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,958
When righteousness advances,
evil is already ten moves ahead.

399
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,244
What is that?

400
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,870
The Blood Demon's
primordial essence manifest!

401
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,831
<i>Primordial essence manifest,</i>
what's that mean?

402
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,677
The Blood Demon's physical body may
be obliterated, but its essence remains.

403
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,555
Using the virgin bones to protect itself,
it will bide its time,

404
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,515
eventually attempting to
resurrect once more.

405
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,980
Grab a hold of my leg!

406
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,968
Even my Grand Sky Mirror
cannot completely eradicate it.

407
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,344
We're in a real mess this time.

408
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,263
A real mess?
Then who's gonna clean it up?

409
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,724
I can keep it from getting worse
in the meantime.

410
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,893
My Grand Sky Mirror is able to
subdue it for now.

411
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,936
But after 7 times 7 is 49 days,

412
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,314
the Big Dipper in the heavens
will change alignment.

413
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,816
And then, as per every ten years,

414
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,818
my Grand Sky Mirror's brilliance
will fade,

415
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,403
its magnificence will vanish.

416
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,615
- Then what?
- You'll have to clean up the mess!

417
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:43,201
- I'll have to clean it up?
- Of course! If not you, who? Me?

418
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,620
Haven't you heard the saying?

419
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,663
<i>Aged waves push young waves forward.</i>

420
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,373
There were two swords
at the founding of Mount O-Mei.

421
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,542
One was the Tzu-Ying,
the other was the Ching-So.

422
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,877
They were known as the
Purple & Green Dual Swords.

423
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:55,213
18 years ago, the girl prodigy Li I-Chi
took these swords and entered asceticism

424
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,215
in the Sky Beyond the Sky,
the Cave Within the Cave.

425
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,093
Now, it is only with these swords
can we destroy the Blood Demon!

426
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,720
How do I get to this place?

427
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,431
The entrance is at Heaven's Blade Peak.

428
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,058
You must set out immediately.

429
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,226
If you do not return in time,
once it is free,

430
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,104
not even the combined powers
of the Three Immortals, the Two Elders,

431
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,315
the Lone Youth, and the Seven Monks
can stop it!

432
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,317
- You hear me?
- What about you, then?

433
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,736
Don't be daft! If I leave,
who else can put up with it?

434
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:18,904
Leave now!

435
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,449
What are you waiting for?

436
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,833
18th generation disciple of Kun-Lun,
I-Ching, kneel and receive your orders!

437
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,840
From this moment forth, you are
the 18th chief of the Kun-Lun Sect!

438
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,008
Receive your orders!

439
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,679
These are the Dharma beads
of the Kun-Lun chief.

440
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:44,888
I-Ching!

441
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,809
You must never forget, as the chief,
you are responsible for the entire sect.

442
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,937
You inherit its past, usher in its future.
Glory to Kun-Lun!

443
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,065
Master, you're not really
giving up, are you?

444
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,233
Leave me alone!

445
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:01,154
How can someone like me be chief...?

446
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,079
<i>What happened to the rock?</i>

447
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,124
Master!

448
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,253
You think you can just seal your meridians
and take your own life?

449
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,005
- I'll find someone to heal you!
- I won't let you heal me!

450
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,673
- I'll heal you no matter what!
- I won't let you heal me!

451
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,008
Be quiet!

452
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,263
Who do you think...

453
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,931
you were talking to just now...?

454
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,810
I'm the chief! I can't—

455
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:36,857
Master...

456
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,525
I didn't do it on purpose.

457
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,193
I'll restring it at the very least.

458
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,779
To think, the world is in even
greater turmoil than I imagined.

459
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,616
At first, I wanted to implore you
to come save us, the ordinary people.

460
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,078
But I don't know who's
saving whom anymore.

461
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,539
Today is the first of
the 7 times 7 is 49 days.

462
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,167
Once I've taken this monk to be healed,

463
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,544
I'll immediately go in search of
the Purple & Green Dual Swords.

464
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,129
I only hope I won't be too late.

465
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,598
[<i>SPRING TERRACE OF HEARING</i>]

466
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,851
What is it?

467
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,227
There's fish.

468
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,859
- There's so many down there!
- Really?

469
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,372
Still running? Still running?
Still running?

470
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,716
The fish tricked me!

471
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,429
You damn fish!

472
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,231
Electric eel!

473
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,904
Soldier Boy, this fish is
still real lively!

474
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,471
Little Master?

475
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,516
- What is it?
- Have you had this before?

476
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,937
I was once a monk for a few days too!

477
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:43,358
The great masters mentioned that eating
cooked fish isn't considered killing.

478
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,568
Have a taste!

479
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,742
- It really isn't killing, right?
- Of course not!

480
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,746
Martial Uncle!

481
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,175
That's not my master!
It's the Blood Demon's double!

482
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,677
- Hey, where's the sword?
- It's behind you!

483
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,561
Which one's real and which one's fake?

484
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,873
What? Why'd he turn into a woman?

485
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,005
Return!

486
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:52,594
Evil and devilry know no bounds.

487
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,679
- You have to be careful, understood?
- Understood.

488
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:56,890
I-Ching, what is that?

489
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,478
It's a fish. I just caught it!

490
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,939
I'm thinking of setting it free,
earn some karma.

491
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,447
If there's nothing else, we'll head for
the Celestial Fort of the Jade Pool.

492
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,242
Good thing martial uncle
didn't realise the fish was cooked.

493
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,534
Hey, hey, right on cue.

494
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,203
You can have all this back.

495
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,298
You may kindly leave now.

496
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,093
The poisoning from which
this great master suffers...

497
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,678
I have no means of curing it.

498
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,807
Look, listen, ask, and feel
are the four essentials of diagnosing.

499
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,600
You've done nothing,
so how do you know he can't be healed?

500
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,394
Perhaps if the fort mistress
ends her seclusion.

501
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,146
- Fort mistress?
- So there's also a fort mistress?

502
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,315
Our mistress has been in seclusion
for many a year.

503
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,901
She will not end her seclusion for you,
unless...

504
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,111
Unless what?

505
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,072
Unless it is meant to be.

506
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,496
The Celestial Fort's Ice Flame
burns only once a month.

507
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,333
The length of time for which it burns
is sometimes long, sometimes short.

508
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,170
If one suffering a malady beholds the
fort mistress before the flame burns out,

509
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,424
the mistress will spare no effort
to heal them of their ailment.

510
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,427
As of now, the flame is nearing its end.

511
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,554
Our mistress has yet to appear.

512
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,681
It seems...

513
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,808
it is not meant to be.

514
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,269
T-t-then, then what will happen
to my master?

515
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,939
Households are bound by rules,
nations are governed by laws.

516
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,401
Since we remain within the Celestial Fort,
we must abide by the fort's ways.

517
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,577
I, Ting Yin, will keep the Ice Flame
burning with my very life's qi.

518
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,912
Even if I am completely drained
of my life's qi,

519
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,873
I, Ting Yin, will not yield!

520
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,541
I made it clear beforehand.

521
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,210
Whatever will be is at the mercy of that
which transcends heaven and earth: Fate.

522
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,922
Right... and what I'm doing now is
preventing the fate that you have created!

523
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,281
Hey, that's the demoness!

524
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,241
We've been had!

525
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,408
Soldier Boy! Soldier Boy! Soldier Boy!

526
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:03,910
Martial Uncle!

527
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,704
You can't go around calling
women <i>demonesses.</i>

528
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,624
- Martial Uncle, that's not it at all.
- Not what?

529
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,876
That fort mistress looked just
like a demoness, though!

530
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,044
You're the demoness!

531
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,506
The sorcerer at the spring terrace used
Shapeshifting Light Magic to trick you.

532
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:17,757
You've been fooled.

533
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:21,636
Now, I need you to be on full alert.

534
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,638
I'm going to open up his
Conception and Governor Vessels.

535
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:24,889
Open up his Conception and
Governor Vessels?

536
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,267
You're gonna transfer martial arts
to him out of the blue?

537
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:28,852
He really should be thanking you.

538
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,501
Master?

539
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,294
Master?

540
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,217
Great Hero?

541
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,426
Quiet now.

542
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,303
Our qi is currently linked.

543
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:49,224
Even the slightest lapse in concentration,
and both our meridians will be destroyed.

544
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:51,851
What should I do now, then?

545
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,354
Combine all your senses,
be like flowing water.

546
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,758
You tread on my master like that,
how can he stay a vegetarian?

547
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,936
When did I get that good?

548
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,413
What is... the meaning of this?

549
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,623
Could it be, you don't want
this monk to be healed?

550
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,674
- Hey? Are you cold?
- It's freezing...

551
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,843
With all those girls hanging out front...

552
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,803
How can we get inside
and see what's going on?

553
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,639
Hey! What are you looking at?

554
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,775
Hey, she's so damn bossy,
we'd be hard-pressed to talk our way in.

555
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,819
I wonder if there's another entrance.

556
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,907
It's so big in here, there must be!

557
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,367
Hey, let's go look for it!

558
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:14,577
Hey!

559
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,915
- Hey, where are you off to?
- Nowhere...

560
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,834
Sister, we're just looking for somewhere
to relieve ourselves. Right?

561
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,294
- Is that alright?
- No, it's not!

562
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,006
While inside the Celestial Fort,
outsiders can't just do as they please!

563
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,884
Whatever, then. When you gotta go,
the world is your latrine!

564
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,928
- How dare you?
- I don't?

565
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,517
Go ahead and try it!

566
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,478
Try it? I'll try it, then. So what?

567
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,402
You think that'll scare me?

568
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,158
Why are you so feisty?

569
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,952
Don't tell my master no matter what!

570
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:27,442
Hsiao-Yu!

571
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,695
Having been in seclusion for so long,
and now expending so much true qi,

572
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:31,988
the mistress needs to rest.

573
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,948
Now the monk's poisoning
has been relieved,

574
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:36,242
the two of you should leave
the Cavern of Mists.

575
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,493
Please.

576
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,509
- Hey, Soldier Boy! There's a hole!
- They might've entered the tunnel!

577
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,720
- Let's get 'em!
- If there's a hole, then get in!

578
00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:59,599
What kind of hole is this?

579
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,893
Help!

580
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,686
I'm underwater!

581
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,105
Soldier Boy, hurry up and save me!

582
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,116
Hey! Wake up now!

583
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,910
Hey! Are you dead yet?

584
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,578
Wh... Where am I?

585
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,955
- You don't know how to swim?
- I don't know how to swim.

586
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,505
- Flying swords!
- Flying swords!

587
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:37,345
You damn bitches!
You love peeping, huh? There!

588
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,023
That pair's gone too!

589
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,954
I'm going to take you to see your masters.

590
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,540
Let them know just exactly how
you offend public decency!

591
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,251
Don't do it!
Big Miss, I'm begging you. Don't—

592
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,212
You win some, you lose some.
Why should I be scared to see 'em?

593
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,381
If master finds out
I pulled her waistband off,

594
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,299
he'll accuse me of offending
public decency!

595
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,093
Pulling off a waistband's nothing!

596
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,427
What's that?

597
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,388
- What?
- Don't make her angry...

598
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,265
Big Miss, I'll do whatever you want.

599
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:24,433
Just don't make a big deal out of this.

600
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,852
Then we'll be even.

601
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,562
In that case...

602
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,897
Alright, then! You slap him.
He slaps you.

603
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,567
You keep slapping each other until
Big Miss isn't mad anymore.

604
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,611
When you've stopped being mad,
it'll be my turn, then!

605
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,614
Haven't you heard the saying,
<i>killing is fine, humiliating is not</i>?

606
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,782
I'm not slapping him!

607
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,367
Your neck's so stiff you won't slap him?

608
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,160
You have to face your masters otherwise.

609
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,997
They're not my masters.
I'll face 'em, so what?

610
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,875
Don't do it! Don't do it...

611
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,919
- Soldier Boy, slap me. C'mon, slap me!
- I don't slap brothers.

612
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,005
Don't treat me as a brother.
C'mon, slap me.

613
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,673
- I won't, I won't, I won't.
- Slap me.

614
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,302
If you won't slap me,
I'll slap myself, then.

615
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:06,475
How can you be the chief
if you don't have any dignity?

616
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,146
I'm thinking of stepping down.

617
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:23,868
I hold out!

618
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:29,373
Luckily, I've still got some tricks left.
Don't think I'm some kind of pushover!

619
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,769
The Ice Flame has burned out,

620
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,979
thereby marking the end
of our fate together.

621
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,941
Fort Mistress, may our paths cross again.

622
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:07,453
Since our fate together has ended,
how can our paths cross again?

623
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,707
<i>When the Ice Flame burns, as does fate,</i>
so why have you come out to see me?

624
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,292
I didn't come out to see you.

625
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,087
If not to see me,
then perhaps to fight me?

626
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,005
The one named Ting, you speak the truth.

627
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,840
That day I healed the monk,
you were ill-mannered towards me.

628
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,592
I wish to wash away the disgrace!

629
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:22,885
Ill-mannered?

630
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:25,179
Are you so exhausted
you can't think straight?

631
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,182
When you fainted that day,
all I did was help you up.

632
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,559
If that is considered ill-mannered,
then I, Ting Yin, am a degenerate.

633
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:31,852
Or so you tell me.

634
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,145
I...

635
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,772
You, you, you, you speak up, then.

636
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,774
The one named Ting,
your arrogance runs wild!

637
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,317
I must discipline you!

638
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,703
Just two moves isn't enough
to discipline me, is it?

639
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,907
I know you have matters to attend to.

640
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,117
Is that so?

641
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,287
I'll save three moves for when
we resume our fight upon your return.

642
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,414
If you're brave enough to wait,
I'll be brave enough to return.

643
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,499
Very well. We'll slap palms
to mark our promise.

644
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,348
I-Chen? I-Chen...?

645
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,691
That's fine. You stay behind
and take care of your master, then.

646
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,408
You can come out now!

647
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,370
I knew you would definitely follow me.

648
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:17,083
Not an edge of steel on you.
What will you do if anything happens?

649
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,836
You have two swords.
Gift me one so I can defend myself.

650
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,927
This sword is one I have been
hanging on to to give to my disciple.

651
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,262
Master!

652
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:31,931
Don't get the wrong impression.

653
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:33,933
I don't want to
take on a disciple just yet.

654
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:36,685
This sword...
I'm lending it to you in the meantime.

655
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,190
Take it.

656
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:45,111
It's alright, I guess.
Better than nothing.

657
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:57,790
Great Hero?

658
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,051
Oh, no... Someone's in trouble.

659
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,095
Great Hero? Great Hero?

660
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,520
My complexion's hideous, isn't it?

661
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:21,814
It's not...

662
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,482
I wouldn't say it's too hideous.

663
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,903
I've already sealed off
my Nine Great Meridians.

664
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,114
But it's not like paper can cover up fire.

665
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,826
Don't worry! I'll take you to
the Celestial Fort right away!

666
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,038
Ti Ming-Chi... Do you really
want to be my disciple?

667
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:42,209
Kowtow to me three times,
and you'll be my disciple.

668
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,211
This sword will be yours forever!

669
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,142
- Will you heed the words of your master?
- Yes!

670
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:59,977
I want you to promise me one thing.

671
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,688
If we can't reach
the Celestial Fort in three days...

672
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,565
You have to kill me!

673
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:06,817
You hear me?

674
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,152
Kill me!

675
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:12,114
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

676
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:16,076
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

677
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,330
Kill!

678
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:24,793
He's...

679
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,171
You've been poisoned too?

680
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,299
Hurry up and get the fort mistress
to come out and save him!

681
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:33,093
Great Master... Whether the mistress
comes out to save him or not

682
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,095
depends on whether he
and the mistress are meant to be.

683
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,432
<i>The Ice Flame burns, as does fate</i>
is the rule of the Celestial Fort.

684
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,309
- Rule?
- That's right, Master!

685
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,519
- It was the same when we saved you!
- Shut up!

686
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:45,773
You're a traitor to the Kun-Lun Sect!
When is it your place to talk?

687
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,941
Ice Flame?

688
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,108
Correct.

689
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,277
Hurry up, then! Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!

690
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,820
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

691
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:01,956
Fort Mistress!

692
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,463
You are a follower of Buddha,
and yet you lack self-cultivation!

693
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:11,006
This is the Celestial Fort
of the Jade Pool!

694
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,883
You think this is Mount Kun-Lun?

695
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:29,608
If you don't summon the fort mistress now,
I won't hold back!

696
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,321
If you won't hold back, I won't either!

697
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:38,325
You women... You got nothing better to do,
always hiding in a place like this,

698
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,119
coming up with weird rules!

699
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,496
I only became a monk because of you women!

700
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,831
I'm wasting my breath!

701
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,874
You! Come out if you have any gall!

702
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:49,128
Otherwise, hide in there for the
rest of your life, you damn spinster!

703
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:50,379
Hsiao-Yu!

704
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,965
We are only passing guests...

705
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,009
Should you be strong-arming them?

706
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:00,597
The fort mistress and I have
a prior understanding.

707
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:02,725
I said I would definitely return here.

708
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,020
To think, those words would
turn out to be an omen.

709
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:13,027
- Master.
- Disciple...

710
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,486
Master.

711
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,783
You are now one of the South Sea Clan.

712
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,036
I want you to abide by South Sea
clan's creed:

713
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:25,497
<i>To annihilate evil and vanquish devilry,
righteousness surpasses all bonds.</i>

714
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,708
Do it now...

715
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:37,217
Now!

716
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,561
'Righteousness surpasses all bonds'?
'When the Ice Flame burns, as does fate'?

717
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:48,896
How moronic!

718
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:52,274
Your existence is governed by a flame!
You'll heal the dead but not the living!

719
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,734
What Ice Flame? What rules?

720
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,903
It's all lies! You're all just
scattered like sand!

721
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,821
I wont kill! I won't kill...

722
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,371
Get out of my way!

723
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,039
Get out of my way!

724
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,136
Let go already!

725
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,639
You're coming out now?

726
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,101
- Chi Wu-Shuang?
- Fort Mistress.

727
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,311
Spare no effort,
and heed fate's command.

728
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:30,729
Do you understand?

729
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:31,897
Fort Mistress, you—

730
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,900
If something is meant to be,
then let it be.

731
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:17,818
What's wrong?

732
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,778
The mistress damaged her true qi
when she healed you.

733
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:22,865
Now to heal your friend,
I'm afraid she has put herself in danger.

734
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:25,909
Ting Yin...

735
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,704
When healing your friend,
I exhausted my true qi.

736
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,499
Now...

737
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,710
I lack the true qi to heal you.

738
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,378
Life lies in the hand of the healer.

739
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,088
If this is how it is...

740
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:41,675
Fort Mistress... Kill me.

741
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,512
This has already crossed my mind.

742
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:47,055
I understand.

743
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,493
<i>Cherish a smile in your sacrifice.</i>

744
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,537
<i>In a single moment...
affection and animosity end.</i>

745
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,977
I injured the fort mistress.
Hurry up and help her...

746
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,814
- Master!
- Martial Uncle! Are you alright?

747
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,005
- Master!
- Martial Uncle!

748
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:14,703
Ting Yin!

749
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,546
Master? Master?

750
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:28,717
Look what you've done!
You almost killed him!

751
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,720
Alright, alright.
Which one of you is in charge, then?

752
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,472
- I...
- Alright, alright.

753
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,432
No one's in charge?
I'm in charge, then!

754
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,644
Alright, then... from now on,
anything to do with him,

755
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,103
I'll be the one responsible!

756
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,701
Let go of me!

757
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:58,747
Let go of me!
Let go of me—

758
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,458
Let go of me!

759
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,293
Let go of me!

760
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,128
- Let go of me!
- What are you doing?

761
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:08,298
You really want to kill him?
I told you, he's my responsibility!

762
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,718
Let go of me... Let go of me!

763
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:13,512
You let go of me!

764
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,181
Come back down first!
Let me think of a plan. Come down now!

765
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:17,724
Let go of me!

766
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,852
Let go of me! Let go of me!

767
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:23,814
- Let go of me!

768
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:33,782
Do you want to kill him?

769
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:35,033
Damn monk, stand aside!

770
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,743
If you want to kill him,
kill me first!

771
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,050
Fort Mistress...

772
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:54,469
All of you, leave now!

773
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,180
I must break the Bronze Mirror
and seal this place in ice.

774
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,474
Fort Mistress, then how will you leave?

775
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:02,018
Don't let Ting Yin leave!
Don't worry about me!

776
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:03,770
Why do you spare him?

777
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,944
- Leave the Celestial Fort now!
- Leave the Celestial Fort now!

778
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,320
- Why?
- Why?

779
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:18,952
Fort Mistress!

780
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,705
It's too late!

781
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:09,795
Master?

782
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:11,213
Master...?

783
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:14,174
It's always you!

784
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:17,177
If you didn't bring your master here,
would my master be in this mess?

785
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,845
Get my master out from there!

786
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,932
Go rescue my master! Go rescue my master!

787
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,819
The entire Celestial Fort's sealed in ice.
What are you two still doing here?

788
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,028
Leave me alone!

789
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:37,364
Blood!

790
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,122
You can't keep me in here!

791
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,171
What's happening?

792
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,758
If the ice keeps falling here,
this will be sealed in ice too! Let's go!

793
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:01,721
This is the only way out of the fort!

794
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:02,889
T-this hole?

795
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,058
I've tried it before.
I don't know how to swim!

796
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:06,935
Count me out. You two leave without me!

797
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,897
Don't overthink it.
We'll drag him into the water!

798
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,983
No! No! I'll drown! No!

799
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:17,904
Help me—

800
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,514
What are you doing?

801
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,019
I've never left the Celestial Fort before.

802
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:53,106
I don't even know...
where I should go now...

803
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:56,234
You're asking me where you should go?
I don't even know how to answer that.

804
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,612
Men can realise their ambitions anywhere.

805
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,488
You're a delicate little wench, though.

806
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,866
You're terrible with people,
and you're so damn shrill.

807
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:04,284
You cry easy too!

808
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,579
As for what you should do with your life,
I encourage you to become a nun.

809
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,624
Sure, it might be a bit bland,
but you're suited for it.

810
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,792
What's that? You better shut up now!

811
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:16,296
Did I say something wrong?
I just say whatever comes into my head.

812
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:30,727
15, 16, 17.

813
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,774
Hey, what are you doing here?

814
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:38,318
I-Chen, do you remember Long Brows told
us to go to Heaven's Blade Peak

815
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:40,528
to look for Li I-Chi and the
Purple & Green Dual Swords.

816
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:42,405
There's only half a month left.

817
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,699
If we don't go now, and the
demon's essence manifests,

818
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,202
all the good people under heaven
will be met with tragedy.

819
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:50,789
I couldn't save the people in the fort.
Now you want me to try and save others?

820
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,958
I used to be a soldier for Western Shu.

821
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,085
Because I could no longer bear
the chaos of war,

822
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,837
I hoped that one day,
heroes would come and save us all.

823
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,840
Eventually, I met our masters
and thought we were saved.

824
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,177
However, I never imagined that the
righteous would not only refuse to unite,

825
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,971
but also be incapable of action.

826
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,349
The Dual Swords still haven't been found.
Our masters torn away from us.

827
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,309
They were only concerned
with their clans and sects.

828
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,103
They claimed to be subduing demons,

829
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,772
upholding justice, smiting evil,
saving the masses under heaven.

830
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,232
Actually, they were nothing more
than scattered sand.

831
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,275
If we continue to follow
in their footsteps,

832
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,610
say nothing of saving them,

833
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,279
but our generation won't even
be able to save ourselves.

834
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,702
You're right. Master and Martial Uncle
lacked unity,

835
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,328
and that's why they lost to evil.

836
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,247
We shouldn't be like them!

837
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:37,585
Where are we going now, then?

838
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:42,424
The three of us set off immediately
and ascend the Heaven's Blade together.

839
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:03,528
Heaven's Blade Peak. Geez, it's so big.

840
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,697
There's only two days left.
Where do we start?

841
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:07,949
Oh, yeah...

842
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,535
Why are you two so stupid?
Use your mouths, of course!

843
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:11,703
Use our mouths?

844
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:16,207
Li I-Chi the heroine...?

845
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:50,283
How ridiculous... Look with our mouths?

846
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,790
Hey, look over there.

847
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,376
Hey! There's an entrance down there!

848
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,471
The rivers and the lakes laugh with pride,
for 'tis I, Heaven's Blade!

849
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:20,522
For what reason have you three
come to this place?

850
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:23,691
Could it be that he's Li I-Chi?

851
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,402
Don't be stupid. Li I-Chi's a woman.

852
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:31,366
You have yet to answer what I asked you!

853
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,410
Such disregard for rules.

854
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:38,873
Are you even aware that you almost
trespassed into the Demon Realm?

855
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:43,878
This here is the pinnacle
of heaven and earth.

856
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,131
The boundary between gods and demons.

857
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:47,882
This is the boundary between
gods and demons?

858
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,468
That's right, why have you
been chained up here, old man?

859
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:51,636
Nonsense!

860
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:53,888
I am not an old man.

861
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,141
I am Heaven's Blade.

862
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:59,144
None under heaven can keep
the Heaven's Blade chained up!

863
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:08,736
It was by my own hand
that I am chained here!

864
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,906
You well know this is the entrance
to the Demon Realm,

865
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,950
so why did you chain
yourself up here, then?

866
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:17,829
Old man!

867
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,456
Step aside! I will do it myself!

868
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:32,051
Heaven and earth were originally as one.

869
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,928
But gods and demons know not unity.

870
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,849
From when Pan-Ku opened up the sky,
since the primordial chaos,

871
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,268
the war between gods and demons
already endured without end.

872
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:43,438
Therefore, I, Heaven's Blade, have been
deep in thought here for a hundred years,

873
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:45,273
attempting to comprehend
the logic of all this.

874
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,276
Ultimately, I was overwhelmed by
the Dark Qi from the Demon Realm.

875
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:49,944
My strength fades with each passing day.

876
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,989
Thus, I had no alternative
but to chain myself here.

877
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:57,202
On heaven and earth, there is a Dark Qi
emanating from the centre of the universe.

878
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,204
However, the existence of the Virtuous Qi

879
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,664
makes it retreat deep into the underworld.

880
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:05,168
The Dark Qi is the magical root
of the world's self-destruction.

881
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:07,921
Although it is trapped
within the Demon Realm,

882
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,090
it still orchestrates the evil scourge
of war that plagues the world.

883
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:15,094
As long as the Dark Chi exists,
the world will never know peace.

884
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,974
It is most unfortunate that I,
Heaven's Blade, am as advanced in years.

885
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:23,186
With no successor,
I can only stay here and keep watch.

886
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,689
If evil were to pervade the Demon Realm,

887
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,442
its wicked reign of a thousand years
would commence in but a moment.

888
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,445
Is there no one under heaven
that can overcome the Dark Qi?

889
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,616
Currently under heaven, the edge
of the Virtuous Qi has been dulled.

890
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:38,201
That which may overcome it...

891
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:41,204
It may not necessarily be the
Purple & Green Dual Swords and Li I-Chi.

892
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,413
- Li I-Chi?
- Li I-Chi?

893
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,999
- Where is she now?
- Where is she now?

894
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,460
This being the boundary
between gods and demons,

895
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,379
the zenith of the Dark Qi
can be found here.

896
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,049
But by the same token, here also exists
the Residences of the Divine City.

897
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:54,592
She is there to your right,

898
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:56,844
in the Sky Beyond the Sky,
the Cave Within the Cave!

899
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,390
- We finally found her!
- We finally found her!

900
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:04,686
Alas, it is too late...

901
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:05,979
Too late?

902
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,939
She isn't dead, is she, old man?

903
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:10,149
Nonsense! When you die,
she will still live!

904
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:16,489
I speak of myself, how my own powers
have deteriorated to such an extent.

905
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,034
We have had an intruder for some time—
I only realise it now!

906
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,499
Master...?

907
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:33,840
Demons are born of the heart.
The heart is born of infinity.

908
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,302
Gods are born for demons.
Demons exist for gods.

909
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:39,637
Gods and demons were originally
of one lineage.

910
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,808
So why on heaven and earth,
are good and evil divided?

911
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:48,563
The Dark Qi, the ultimate sorcery!

912
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,653
He wants to enter the Demon Realm!

913
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,042
As long as I, Heaven's Blade, am here,

914
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,544
dispel all thoughts of even
stepping into the Demon Realm!

915
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,704
You smacked into my nose...

916
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,176
We'll block his way!

917
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,185
The Seventh Dusk Sword?

918
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,270
That's right. The Seventh Dusk Sword!

919
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,867
The Seventh Dusk Sword is
a blade of justice.

920
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:26,744
This is not our first encounter.

921
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,455
Not our first encounter,
but we are not the men we once were.

922
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,916
Unless you renounce evil
and return to righteousness!

923
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,794
Your naivety is astounding!

924
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,255
Even if I'm astoundingly naive,
I'll still upturn the cosmos!

925
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:40,216
The world is in enough turmoil.
I won't let you enter the Demon Realm!

926
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:49,100
A mantis cannot halt a chariot,
you overestimate your ability!

927
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,869
You insist on this stubbornness?

928
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,375
- Soldier Boy!
- Soldier Boy!

929
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,848
You have much potential, child.
Fear not, the old man is here!

930
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:36,814
Heaven's Blade...
Your powers are at an end!

931
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,276
I advise you to preserve what's left
of your feeble and aged body.

932
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:43,070
Retire to the countryside
and live out the rest of your days.

933
01:19:43,488 --> 01:19:45,490
My feeble and aged body?

934
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:47,909
This battle of good and evil
is a battle of determination!

935
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:50,203
Determination?
One is as the high noon sun!

936
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,747
The other is as the dwindling twilight!
There is no contest!

937
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:10,348
Are you alright?

938
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,686
The pull here is too strong!
Don't come any closer!

939
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:20,107
Get out of here now!
Or it'll be too late!

940
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:22,610
Soldier Boy!

941
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:26,405
- Soldier Boy, don't let go!
- Hold on tight!

942
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:28,824
- Soldier Boy!
- Soldier Boy!

943
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,035
- Soldier Boy!
- Soldier Boy!

944
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:34,622
- Soldier Boy! Don't give up!
- Soldier Boy, are you alright?

945
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,791
- Soldier Boy! Sol—
- Soldier Boy!

946
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:40,253
Watch out!

947
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:51,556
I-Chen?

948
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,020
I-Chen, what are you doing?

949
01:21:00,815 --> 01:21:02,108
I'm always so gutless...

950
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,569
I don't think I can be the chief.

951
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,616
I'm turning these beads over to you.

952
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,743
Take them back to Mount Kun-Lun for me.

953
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:13,911
But you...

954
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,329
Soldier Boy's trapped inside.

955
01:21:15,955 --> 01:21:18,583
- There's still a chance to save him!
- I-Chen, I'm coming with you!

956
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,002
Don't be stupid!

957
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:24,005
If we don't make it back out,
who'll look for the Dual Swords?

958
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:25,673
I can stay here and wait for you!

959
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:29,885
Wait for me? If I make it back out,
I'll definitely come look for you!

960
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,555
If I don't come back,
what's the point of you waiting, then?

961
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,602
Time to part ways. We can't hesitate.

962
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:38,811
It's just you and me left.

963
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:40,896
If we don't leave now,
then no one'll be saved!

964
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:42,273
Time to part ways!

965
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,901
Go!

966
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,034
Why are you still here?

967
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:20,269
Soldier Boy...?

968
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,076
Hurry up and save Soldier Boy...

969
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,952
Or he'll be sucked into
the Demon Realm!

970
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,496
I-Chen!

971
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:41,207
Soldier Boy!

972
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:46,879
Grab onto this!

973
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,008
Hold on tight!

974
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,182
Hey—

975
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,519
Soldier Boy, don't worry.

976
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:03,396
We're safe now.

977
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,858
But... I don't know how
to get out of here.

978
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:11,529
Boy, I'll use my final breath
to send you outside!

979
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,280
Hold onto the chain next to you.

980
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:22,748
Elder Heaven's Blade died
in order to save us.

981
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:30,131
Soldier Boy!

982
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,354
Soldier Boy? Soldier Boy...?

983
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,314
Soldier Boy...?

984
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,233
Come up now!

985
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,777
I don't how to swim.
I won't be able to save you!

986
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:53,487
Soldier Boy?

987
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,455
Solider... Boy...?

988
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:03,998
Soldier Boy...?

989
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,346
Soldier Boy, we escaped from
the Demon Realm. We're safe!

990
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,683
Soldier Boy? Don't be like this!

991
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,643
Soldier Boy? Answer me!

992
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,687
How are you feeling? Soldier Boy?

993
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,358
The Purple Sword?

994
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:33,694
The Green Sword?

995
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,655
Soldier Boy, did you see it?

996
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,032
Did you see it?

997
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,409
It's the Purple & Green Dual Swords!

998
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,370
Look! There's someone over there!

999
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,336
Li I-Chi?

1000
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:52,296
That is I.

1001
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:53,923
Hooray! We—

1002
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,509
Soldier Boy, we found Li I-Chi!

1003
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,857
Hey... why are you dressed like that?

1004
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,151
You too!

1005
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,029
- Matriarch Li I-Chi.
- Matriarch Li I-Chi.

1006
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,365
I am already aware of Long Brow's plight.

1007
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:20,950
You have come from so far away...

1008
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,409
Did you know?

1009
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,078
<i>Heroes abound like
a thousand crashing waves.</i>

1010
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:25,371
<i>From the rivers and the mountains,
the gifted emerge.</i>

1011
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:28,332
You are this generation's masters of
the Purple & Green Dual swords!

1012
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:35,548
Thank you for the swords, Matriarch.

1013
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,175
The qi of heaven and earth
controls the entire cosmos.

1014
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:41,262
The Dual Swords are forged from
the earth's precious stones.

1015
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:43,764
Swords are wielded by man.
Man is wielded by their hearts.

1016
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:46,517
Once the trinity of heaven, earth, man
unite as one,

1017
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:48,394
their might will be endless and infinite!

1018
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,733
However, while heaven and earth,
and yin and yang coalesce,

1019
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,235
they also contradict.

1020
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,487
Therefore, the Dual Swords
must never cross.

1021
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,407
Otherwise, there will be endless
and infinite calamity.

1022
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,450
At best, the swordsmen will die.

1023
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,160
At worst, heaven and earth
will be wounded.

1024
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,746
All living things will perish—
a mutual destruction,

1025
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,083
And yet...

1026
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,961
these two swords of heaven and earth
are at their most powerful

1027
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:16,839
when they as two unite as one.

1028
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,383
They can't cross but also can't not cross?
What do we do?

1029
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,302
Even I am unable to understand this.

1030
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,471
I will transmit my voice a thousand miles
and consult Ancestor Long Brows.

1031
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,022
Long Brows?

1032
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,193
They've found the
Purple & Green Dual Swords!

1033
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:51,081
If this keeps up—

1034
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,878
How come Li I-Chi and I
are of one in heart and mind?

1035
01:27:06,347 --> 01:27:08,849
Long Brows, why is it the
two swords cannot cross?

1036
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:10,684
For the two swords to cross,

1037
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,937
the wielders must be
one in heart and mind.

1038
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:14,813
The seven stars are about to shift.

1039
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:18,108
At which time, my Grand Sky Mirror
will be rendered useless.

1040
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,402
What does it mean to be
<i>one in heart and mind</i>?

1041
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,363
<i>One in heart and mind</i>
is when two people speak,

1042
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:23,739
their voices ring out as one.

1043
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:26,408
Swords are wielded by man.
Man is wielded by their hearts.

1044
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,494
If the two of them are
one in heart and mind,

1045
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:30,287
the two swords will unite as one.

1046
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,039
- Thus, the cosmos is upturned,
- Thus, the cosmos is upturned,

1047
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:33,624
- heaven and earth unite as one!
- heaven and earth unite as one!

1048
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:35,084
Heaven and earth unite as one...

1049
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,544
and the two must be of one heart?

1050
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,313
The Purple Sword is heaven.
The Green Sword is earth.

1051
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,066
The Purple & Green Dual Swords.
Heaven and earth unite as one.

1052
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,035
Matriarch Li?

1053
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:11,453
- Matriarch Li?
- Matriarch Li?

1054
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,288
Matriarch Li?

1055
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:19,670
- Master.
- Master.

1056
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:24,008
You need not be sad.

1057
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:25,676
- Are you playing tricks? No!
- Are you playing tricks? No!

1058
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:26,844
It is I.

1059
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:29,638
My primordial essence has
united the two of you as one.

1060
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,515
- Are we still men?
- Are we still men?

1061
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:32,891
Of course, you are.

1062
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,768
Look how worried you are...

1063
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:38,939
For heaven and earth to unite as one,
the two of you must be in harmony.

1064
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:42,192
With my primordial essence, the two of you
can be one in heart and mind.

1065
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:45,112
Consider it <i>aged waves push
the young waves forward.</i>

1066
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:46,822
A new generation is replacing the old.

1067
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:48,699
The seven stars will soon
change alignment.

1068
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:49,950
Hurry to Mount O-Mei.

1069
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:51,952
Kill the primordial child
and save Long Brows!

1070
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,538
- Aye, Master!
- Aye, Master!

1071
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:11,889
Eastern Shu remnants, listen up!

1072
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:14,558
We let you escape last time,
but today you meet your end!

1073
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:17,394
Western Shu remnants, we feigned defeat
to lure you to San-Chang Brook!

1074
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,606
To think, we waited for such a long time,
and yet you cowards never showed!

1075
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,778
Oh, no... The seven stars are
changing alignment.

1076
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:32,117
Stop fighting! Look above you!

1077
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:33,494
Charge!

1078
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,082
Can you hear me...?

1079
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,751
Western Shu, only one of us
can exist in this world!

1080
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:50,677
- Where's our commander?
- How do we fight without a commander?

1081
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:53,347
I've hung your commanders up here!

1082
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:56,475
How strange! How did our commander
get up there?

1083
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,685
The primordial child on the mountain
is about to manifest!

1084
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:01,563
If you don't leave now,
you'll be in great danger!

1085
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:04,858
- What's that damn girl on about?
- Right! What are you on about?

1086
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:08,529
Look over there!

1087
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,618
Hey! Careful not to get sucked in!

1088
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,377
I-Chen, what devilry is this...?

1089
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:33,220
Hurry up and follow me!

1090
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:36,306
Hey! Hurry up and follow the commander!

1091
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:40,394
They're flying so fast,
how can we possibly keep up...?

1092
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:49,194
What? It's Ting Yin!

1093
01:30:51,822 --> 01:30:54,324
- He's stopping us from saving Long Brows!
- That's right! Yeah!

1094
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,084
Damn... He's locked up the swords!

1095
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,590
- I-Chen, watch out!
- Soldier Boy!

1096
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:13,051
The ultimate sorcery is
the nemesis of the righteous!

1097
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:16,388
- Hey!
- I-Ching!

1098
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:21,560
Why did the sky turn dark?

1099
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,025
The Blood Demon devours the sun?

1100
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,776
Keep your balance!

1101
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:37,034
How can I possibly let you manifest?

1102
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:38,702
I won't let you devour the sun!

1103
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:44,583
I can't stand anymore!

1104
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:47,252
Brother, get off me!

1105
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,463
I'm being crushed too!

1106
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,219
Why aren't the Purple & Green
Dual Swords here yet?

1107
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:57,638
Stop pushing me! Hey!

1108
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:01,099
I'm not pushing you,
the ground's gone slanted!

1109
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:02,768
Then why are you still pushing me?

1110
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,728
It's a cliff down there!

1111
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,064
Hold on tight! Don't fall down!

1112
01:32:07,231 --> 01:32:09,566
I can't even stand straight,
how can I hold on?

1113
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,027
Stop pushing me!

1114
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:14,112
Don't push me!

1115
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:21,078
If you grab onto each other in a line,
you won't all fall down there!

1116
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:23,372
- Grab onto me!
- Grab on now!

1117
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:26,375
Hey! Hold on tight or you'll fall!

1118
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,419
Hey! You're pulling too hard down there!
I can't hold on!

1119
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,755
My neck! My neck!

1120
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:38,720
Don't let him lock up our swords!

1121
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:40,806
I know! We'll transform
the swords into shields!

1122
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:45,060
My magic is boundless!
You cannot block it!

1123
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,915
Soldier Boy, where are you?

1124
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:09,418
Solider Boy! Where are you?

1125
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:13,672
I-Chen! I'm over here!

1126
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,174
I-Chen, are you alright?

1127
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:17,634
I'm fine!

1128
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:19,261
I'm fine too!

1129
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:20,971
I can't see Ting Yin right now.

1130
01:33:21,138 --> 01:33:23,307
But he should be somewhere
between the two of us.

1131
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:24,808
To break through his magic,

1132
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:27,185
we have to get him in a pincer,
attack from either side!

1133
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,146
I don't know where you are!
How can we fight him, then?

1134
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:32,190
Our hearts and minds are connected,
we'll be able to find each other!

1135
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:33,358
Really?

1136
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:34,735
We're running out of time!

1137
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,903
We have to unite the
Purple & Green Dual Swords!

1138
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,630
<i>They're trying to unite?</i>

1139
01:33:57,924 --> 01:34:00,469
I-Chen, he's trying to exhaust
our life's qi!

1140
01:34:02,596 --> 01:34:04,931
Tzu-Ying, Ching-So. As you are
beginning to unite,

1141
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:06,641
your minds must be connected,

1142
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:09,603
or once the Dual Swords meet,
both man and sword will be undone!

1143
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:13,148
At this critical stage,
your mind mustn't lose concentration!

1144
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:14,733
You must focus!

1145
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:23,033
You still haven't united?
I can't take it anymore!

1146
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:27,412
I-Chen, did you lose concentration
just now,

1147
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,581
almost destroying the Dual Swords...?

1148
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:31,291
Soldier Boy! I get it now!

1149
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:32,709
Let's unite now!

1150
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:33,877
Alright!

1151
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,754
Damn! He's in the way!

1152
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:38,548
You wish to unite?
The end has come for the righteous!

1153
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:42,219
I'm not powerful enough,
my historical mission is almost over!

1154
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,648
The Blood Demon manifests!

1155
01:35:02,114 --> 01:35:04,324
Oh, no... I can't look...

1156
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,080
Ting Yin, the venom runs too deep.

1157
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:15,085
I think... you and I are both powerless.

1158
01:35:15,252 --> 01:35:17,087
<i>As long as the green mountains stand.</i>

1159
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,548
<i>In a single moment,
affection and animosity end.</i>

1160
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:29,808
A fine line separates good and evil.

1161
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:33,854
By sacrificing herself, the fort mistress
fulfilled a great act of subduing demons.

1162
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,730
Truly worthy of respect and admiration.

1163
01:35:39,985 --> 01:35:40,986
Unite now!

1164
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:54,458
Let's see you survive that!

1165
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:00,338
Up there, what is that?

1166
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:01,965
There's something flying down!

1167
01:36:02,591 --> 01:36:04,384
Yeah! It's three people!

1168
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:11,391
The descendant bows
to greet Long Brows.

1169
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,311
Truly <i>Heroes abound like
a thousand crashing waves.</i>

1170
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:17,189
<i>From the rivers and the mountains,
a new generation rises victorious!</i>

1171
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:29,659
I'm goin'!

1172
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:36,917
Fatty?

1173
01:36:37,501 --> 01:36:41,129
Fatty, our bodies may stand as two,
but our hearts are as one.

1174
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:43,673
Hopefully, when this gourd returns to you,

1175
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,510
all the people of the world will be
one in heart and mind,

1176
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:48,803
wars will cease to be,
there is peace under heaven.

1177
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:50,847
Then it will truly be a bright new day!

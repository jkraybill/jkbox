1
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,052
It's my head?

2
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:53,597
We'll know more tomorrow.

3
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,812
Those are nicer than my images.

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,325
Nature changes if we get too close.

5
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:09,459
- That's just charm.
- I'm charming.

6
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,476
- Lucas...
- I love to talk.

7
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:14,052
Words are my thing.
So my head...

8
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,180
...is affected.
- How badly?

9
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:20,313
Nature changes when observed.
It's minor.

10
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:21,843
A minor problem?

11
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:26,578
It's neither dead nor alive.
I'm not kidding.

12
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,186
A mystery, like an orgasm?

13
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:30,300
Not for long.

14
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,817
Sure.
Nature's secrets throw us off.

15
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:36,984
I'm handsome, so I'm a problem.

16
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:39,346
Oh no, it's only a virus.

17
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:42,967
Only its progression is known.

18
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,922
We've seen it recently
with electroscopes.

19
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,787
It kills 400 a year.

20
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,296
It changes part of the brain...

21
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,213
- Night falls...
- Fast?

22
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,198
- Balanchine, the dancer.
- I don't dance.

23
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,358
- I'll call tomorrow.
- I better hurry.

24
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,589
- Don't stay alone.
- Tonight?

25
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,158
Stop it, asshole!

26
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:06,929
She'll turn her back,

27
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:10,626
like every other night.

28
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,201
Funny, aren't they?

29
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:17,166
No, I think they're pretty happy.

30
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:19,705
You're the funny one.

31
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:22,351
They'll go home tired,

32
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:25,406
others cruise on their Hondas.

33
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,494
- Leave me alone!
- Bitch!

34
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,412
You son of a bitch!

35
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:36,502
I'm fed up!

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,557
- Asshole!
- May I...

37
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:44,154
Stop it, you lazy fuck!

38
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:50,764
They're poor
and they shouldn't have it so bad.

39
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,516
I love you!

40
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,257
- You see?
- They're drunks.

41
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,079
- You're a drunk.
- Fly face!

42
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:07,785
Horse's ass!

43
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:10,115
I got most of the press.

44
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:11,536
You're famous!

45
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:13,456
"Soir de Paris."

46
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:15,125
We got Vogue, VSD

47
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:18,845
and, get ready...
The cover of Paris Match!

48
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,858
Wow, great, Mom!

49
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:23,409
François did a great job.

50
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:26,532
They're all fags in the press.

51
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,234
Mom!

52
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:30,085
He did it for you.

53
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:34,780
What's this crap?
They say Dad's still a truck driver...

54
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:36,310
Crap. Yes!

55
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:39,718
This is all bullshit.

56
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:42,088
Who cares? At least we're in it.

57
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,209
In it, out of it, right.

58
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,645
It's ok, we can be proud.

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,490
My compliments. C-c-c-ompliments.

60
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,172
- Excuse me.
- What's wrong?

61
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,729
Ladies, want a drink on me?
I'm Lucas

62
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:57,843
de blah blah...

63
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,964
Why not? He's polite.

64
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,495
I said no!

65
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:05,425
That's ok.
The color of your drink goes with...

66
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:09,225
- With what?
- Everything. Your mom's mouth.

67
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,313
Your mouth is black.

68
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,152
- I told you.
- He's sick!

69
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,133
How right you are.

70
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,184
Women are frightening.

71
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,141
I was looking for you!

72
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:21,783
Saw your bike. Can I sit?

73
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,012
Chair.

74
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,935
- So, old buddy!
- Who's old?

75
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:29,125
They called. They love it.

76
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:32,357
You can't imagine
their enthusiasm.

77
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:35,878
- No, can't imagine.
- Cross our fingers.

78
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:39,384
There's a 100% chance

79
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:42,521
- the language 'll be adopted.
- You can only adopt orphans.

80
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:43,801
Lucas...

81
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,259
I don't feel like joking.
I want to cry.

82
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:51,080
6 years! You're a genius.

83
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,231
Europe is using your language.

84
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,228
- Me too.
- You too?

85
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,392
I feel like crying too.

86
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,021
I'll get the news out.

87
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:07,707
But there are
some lovely items in the paper.

88
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,338
What's that?

89
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:11,875
I'll go call.

90
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:13,407
- What's her name?
- Who?

91
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,206
- The girl you slept with.
- We slept with.

92
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:18,764
She never said.

93
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,789
Phone's downstairs?

94
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,752
I was afraid I'd forget her name.

95
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,731
I have to go to the ladies' room.
Wait here.

96
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,859
Stay standing. Don't be scared.

97
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:05,178
The bait.

98
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,794
No bait, no bite.

99
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:16,040
How about another drink?

100
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,550
"'No' goes without saying."

101
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,372
- Someone said that.
- Someone dumb.

102
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,929
- There's a glare.
- No, a shadow.

103
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,502
Take off those eclipse glasses.

104
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:31,235
Eclipse?

105
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,466
I'd like a drink.

106
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,065
My heart's beating.

107
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:56,637
If it didn't, you'd be dead.

108
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,299
It's too late to drink.

109
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:02,590
Too late?

110
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,466
It's dinnertime.

111
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,720
I just had a cheeseburger.

112
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,321
Cheese.

113
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:11,876
You can also say "please."

114
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:15,487
Are you a joker or what?

115
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,515
Please give me your hand.

116
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,605
Your hand.

117
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:32,577
Huh?

118
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,664
You always say that.

119
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,310
What should I say?

120
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,493
Not "huh," nothing.

121
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:43,051
Ok, I'll stop talking.

122
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,251
I say, "How about dinner?"

123
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:48,514
That's the name of a play.

124
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,556
I don't know.

125
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,406
I do.

126
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:03,851
I wasn't coming on to you.

127
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,594
Why'd you throw it?

128
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,344
I was upset.

129
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:16,450
Don't ever hide that again.

130
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,172
Day people become night people.

131
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:24,730
People meet,
drink and have dinner.

132
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,988
You'll be hungry soon.

133
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,287
What else can we do?

134
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,617
- Go to a movie!
- We can't talk.

135
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:36,200
I don't talk with my mouth full.

136
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,229
I'll keep it.

137
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:45,876
Why'd you do that?

138
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,708
What's this?

139
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,517
A foot.

140
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:53,635
And this?

141
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:54,711
A butt.

142
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:56,665
And...

143
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:58,432
A gut.

144
00:08:58,895 --> 00:08:59,381
And this?

145
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,601
Those are your shoes.

146
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:07,552
- And that?
- Let's go, come on!

147
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,346
- That's a slut?
- No, that's Mom.

148
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,180
- Is this table suitable?
- Even better.

149
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:32,880
- Would you like a drink, Miss?
- Yes, a Ricard.

150
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:36,328
No, champagne for her.

151
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:40,007
- My scotch's outside.
- It's on its way.

152
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:43,008
Who was that guy?

153
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:47,184
My assistant,
a promising mathematician.

154
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,409
And who are you?

155
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,679
Who am I?
I am Adventure.

156
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:03,919
- I don't eat meat.
- You mean dead cows?

157
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:11,394
I hate oysters,
and whiskey makes me sick.

158
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,510
What's "swimming fish?"

159
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,255
It can't walk.

160
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,761
- "Veal in a pocket?"
- Cow embryo.

161
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,393
No way.

162
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:21,723
Right, no way.

163
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,687
That'd be disgusting.

164
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,012
We can go if you want.

165
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,634
I just got really sad.

166
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,517
It's a heavy load.

167
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,717
We have to be patient.

168
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,121
- Do you have lovers?
- I'm very careful.

169
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,549
No one's careful at 20.

170
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:57,244
I feel like I can't,
it's too much.

171
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:01,565
- What is?
- Living, understanding.

172
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,408
You can be so intense.

173
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,681
- I want to cry.
- I'm that intense?

174
00:11:16,214 --> 00:11:17,946
It all happens at once.

175
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,910
I got here too late.

176
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,524
- I wouldn't have noticed you before.
- Before what?

177
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,307
When I was dating younger guys,
you would've seemed too old.

178
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,331
"Would have seemed,"
that's good grammar.

179
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:31,688
My grammar's bad?

180
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,813
- We talk like we think.
- So bad?

181
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:37,917
- Risky.
- I never say what I think.

182
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:41,737
- Think pink.
- I can't talk, I'm vulgar,

183
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:45,010
because I don't eat fish
swimming in whiskey?

184
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:47,107
Ready to order?

185
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,151
Ok, whatever.

186
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:53,360
I don't want to cry.

187
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:57,439
What should we do?

188
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,552
Forget the order.

189
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,693
That's too embarrassing.

190
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:06,268
Oysters and veal for the lady,

191
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:09,094
- with Pastis sauce.
- Pardon me?

192
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,597
Alright, Miss?

193
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,381
That's Mrs.

194
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,674
Ok, right.

195
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,357
That's it.

196
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,468
That's what?!

197
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,809
I hate weddings, couples, betrayals,

198
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:27,045
people tearing each other apart.

199
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,130
It's not that simple!

200
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:33,165
It's all simple,
you just have to realize it.

201
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:36,084
Simple, no one wants anything!

202
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,732
- You don't love anyone.
- No.

203
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,310
- I could love you.
- Me?!

204
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,436
That'd be a huge mistake.
I use people,

205
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,773
I'm totally self-centered!
I want a pear!

206
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,828
One pear.

207
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:53,829
- And you, sir?
- Brains, please.

208
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,260
Yes, sir.

209
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:57,376
Care for some wine?

210
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:01,001
I don't care, I want.

211
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:04,265
- Wine?
- Beer and lemonade.

212
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:09,732
Tequila, sake, vodka,
and caipiroska in a tall glass,

213
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,887
with a piece of asparagus.

214
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:13,767
Yes, sir.

215
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:15,716
I'm leaving.

216
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,738
You won.

217
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,470
- Your husband will console you.
- This was a faux pas.

218
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,190
Faux pas,
pas de deux, Broadway!

219
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:28,206
Shut up!

220
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:31,470
No, I'll forget what I'm saying.

221
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,429
My words string along like pearls.

222
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,553
Then talk to yourself.

223
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,084
Sir, your check!

224
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,917
You ordered, you drank.
Settle the bill!

225
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,454
Bill, will, spill.

226
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,273
- Money.
- Sir, that hardly covers it.

227
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,367
C-c-covers it.

228
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,904
Cover, smother, other.

229
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,829
- Fork it over!
- Fork god's sake!

230
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,172
Pay!

231
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:32,949
Move over.

232
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:00,924
There you are.
I thought I'd never find you.

233
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:06,559
"The Everlasting Return,"
a fine work.

234
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:10,876
The phone's ringing off the hook.
There was a party.

235
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,857
I didn't know that.

236
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,913
- You like gum?
- Love it.

237
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,719
You feeling up?

238
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:19,326
Down, in hell.

239
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:22,840
- Got a hangover?
- Hungry, cold.

240
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:25,413
- How can I say it?
- Say what?

241
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,359
- I love you, sir.
- Why so polite?

242
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:29,485
I don't love you as a friend.

243
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,751
You've been helpful, tough.

244
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,881
You've always been rich.
You're amazing.

245
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:38,594
- You'll hurt me when it's over.
- It's not over.

246
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:42,217
When we sign,
you'll have it made.

247
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:45,840
- IBM will take notice.
- You'll take off.

248
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:52,161
- Because of her?
- Because of her.

249
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,230
This is yours.

250
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:01,420
- Hello, Miss.
- That's hello, Ma'am.

251
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,609
I'll wait for you.

252
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,099
I'll wait for you?

253
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,392
I'm leaving.

254
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:11,441
Already?

255
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,464
I came to say I'm leaving.

256
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,753
I wanted to check.
I didn't know.

257
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,254
Me neither.

258
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,935
I'm glad you didn't.

259
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,754
Now I'm sure.

260
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,225
All the taste is gone.

261
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:45,784
- I chewed it.
- That explains it.

262
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,377
- Forgive me.
- My fault.

263
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:05,222
I said such stupid things yesterday.

264
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:08,253
I stopped listening to you.

265
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,148
I have to keep talking.

266
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:16,016
I'm like a bathtub,
letting the water run out.

267
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,740
Let it run out on me.

268
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,438
Now it hurts even more.

269
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,415
They're picking me up.

270
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:34,832
- You know where you're going?
- Not with you.

271
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:37,685
- Where?
- I'm working.

272
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,641
- Where?
- 3 days. Casino.

273
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,042
Casino, the supermarket?

274
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,928
- No, a real one.
- Gambling?

275
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:49,337
No, I'd be terrible.
I never lie.

276
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:53,101
Will I see you again?

277
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:55,216
I don't know.

278
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,323
I might get a contract.

279
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:04,652
I came looking for you
because you touched my heart.

280
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:09,518
I wasn't prepared,
I tried to be like Mom.

281
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:17,277
What's going on?

282
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,616
What's your address?

283
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,279
We're late!

284
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,706
Are you the husband?

285
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:24,410
Are you the clown?

286
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,605
- Stop that!
- I'll kick his ass.

287
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:30,114
- Don't cry.
- It won't help anyway.

288
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,371
Orly airport.

289
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,264
- That's where you're going?
- It's in the papers!

290
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,777
I'll let you go.
It's my big day.

291
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:42,228
I invented a language
for computer images.

292
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,617
I invented a computer language...

293
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,805
It has more of a future than I do...

294
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:55,861
It's in Biarritz, sir.

295
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:58,126
You be careful.

296
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:01,006
Don't hurt my Blanche.

297
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:03,304
What're you doing?

298
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:05,918
I'm asking dumb questions.

299
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:08,981
Don't use the front stairs.

300
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,141
I thought now that...

301
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,219
we're successful, you owe me...

302
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:14,856
I only owe myself.

303
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,289
Really nice of you!

304
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:19,870
Nice, mice, twice, thrice.

305
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:23,558
- What's that?
- A tuxedo.

306
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,335
Tuxedo, casino, ok!

307
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:27,865
You're leaving?

308
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:29,788
Don't you realize?!

309
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:32,286
Yes, realize... fate, dreams.

310
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:36,702
- Air France phone number?
- 45-44-32-32.

311
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:42,035
Call Orly.

312
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:45,193
You're leaving from Orly?

313
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,359
- What's that?
- I told you.

314
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,031
It was your party.

315
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,781
- You mean there are more?
- Have a look.

316
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:55,908
I don't want those floozies here!

317
00:19:56,334 --> 00:20:00,118
- My place is too small.
- Take mine, it's big.

318
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,627
- What?
- Big, wig, room for a pig.

319
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,341
...confusion about departures.

320
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,597
The only available flights
are to Metz, Biarritz and Lyons.

321
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:13,335
No more... damn!

322
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:16,303
Impossible.
Hello?

323
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,223
- Credit card, check book...
- It's your doctor.

324
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,014
He's not in. Is it urgent?

325
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:25,486
Rabbit.

326
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:31,890
Say that again?

327
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:39,753
Lucas!

328
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,570
Rabbit, pause...

329
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:46,704
doctor, me.

330
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:58,394
"I, Lucas de B., sane and voracious,

331
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,758
leave my apartment, clothes,

332
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,686
earthly belongings and glory

333
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:06,783
to Michel Durand, signed Tintin."

334
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,958
Bastard!

335
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,638
Cold, mist,

336
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:14,124
sky, clouds, wind.

337
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:18,326
Pretty landscape. France.

338
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,421
France: My country.

339
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:25,533
Language: French.
Husband: François.

340
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:29,947
Coca-cola.

341
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:33,007
Easy, it's written out.

342
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:37,016
But then there's...

343
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,720
Mac...

344
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,888
Mac... ac... McDonald's.

345
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:45,575
Makavejev, Yugoslavian filmmaker.

346
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:49,642
McLaren Formula One.
What's the formula?

347
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,707
If I formulate, I get lost.

348
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:56,882
My name's Lucas de Bonneval,

349
00:21:57,928 --> 00:21:59,102
and I have a rabbit.

350
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,379
My folks left me in the rabbit hole...

351
00:22:05,477 --> 00:22:07,838
one fine spring morning.

352
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:11,484
Gabriel!

353
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:19,844
Arthur, are you coming?

354
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:24,574
My rabbit!

355
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,759
Whoopee!

356
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,206
Wait for me!

357
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,144
Come on!

358
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:05,969
Can rabbits swim, Daddy?

359
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,485
I know that child.

360
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:39,024
His name is Lucas.

361
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,194
Urgency makes his heart dance.

362
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:45,047
He must find Blanche.

363
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:00,494
And now, the star of our show.

364
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,312
The one you've all been waiting for.

365
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:06,753
She's triumphed all over the country.

366
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:11,627
We're very proud
to have her here tonight.

367
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:15,696
Let's all bask in her glory...

368
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:19,902
Miss Rika Halliday!

369
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:41,616
I love it... Lucas, Rika,

370
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:44,011
rocky, rococo, hara kiri...

371
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:45,894
Hare krishna!

372
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:47,496
...man who raised her...

373
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:49,230
Maniac!

374
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,236
...the bewitching, inexplicable

375
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,949
gift of nature...

376
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:01,517
I'm talking about Raj de Pondichéry!

377
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:04,706
Go, mon chéri!

378
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:21,275
This is gonna be good.

379
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:35,500
- I'm falling asleep!
- Her too.

380
00:25:37,248 --> 00:25:41,032
Follow my finger, follow my finger...

381
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,998
- Up her ass!
- Will you shut up?

382
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,269
As long as he's not touching her.

383
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,561
Watch it, will you?

384
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:11,473
Bitch!

385
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,547
Stop it!

386
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:23,097
Are you ready, Rika?

387
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,413
What's this woman's name?

388
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:39,795
Solange.

389
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:42,818
And that man in the balcony?

390
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:45,710
Cohen.

391
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,996
His wife died during the war.

392
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,179
Taken to a German camp.

393
00:26:57,266 --> 00:27:00,457
The number she bore...

394
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:04,526
603221.

395
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,390
He's wearing 2 wedding rings.

396
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,161
She's the second,

397
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:13,020
I can tell.

398
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:17,053
A love like yours
makes my heart swell.

399
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,375
Is that correct, Ma'am?

400
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,080
Yes.

401
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,344
It's a hoax.

402
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,622
They must have a drugstore...

403
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,704
I mean a data base.

404
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,665
We're late.

405
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:37,927
- We almost missed our flight.
- There she is!

406
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,101
I'm never wrong.

407
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:45,963
...lying to her husband,
she took cash for the wedding band.

408
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:49,514
Her husband is gone.
Her sad days are done!

409
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,459
She rhymes!

410
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,800
- Why'd she say that?
- She's hot. Right, Inès?

411
00:27:59,055 --> 00:28:00,823
And I'm chopped liver?

412
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:03,919
I'm hot, I'm in.
And she is in.

413
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,801
She's a knockout, a bomb!

414
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:09,143
Our daughter.

415
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:12,237
She's of age but lives with us.

416
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,813
We'd like to know why she doesn't...

417
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:18,535
why she can't have...

418
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:20,789
a husband and family.

419
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:26,952
Because when she was 12,
she was raped, it was hell.

420
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,215
She never mentioned...

421
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,615
By whom, dammit?
Who was it?!

422
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,425
The man who's your partner
is also her lover!

423
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:51,866
Sad secrets run wild
in the mind of a child!

424
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:56,316
My love, my life,
when I'm lost, I find you,

425
00:28:56,564 --> 00:29:00,348
my speech is nourished by you.

426
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:04,384
Images like words dancing along,
a simple song.

427
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:06,573
What did I say?

428
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:14,375
- Whatever you think, Edwige.
- I'm never wrong.

429
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,284
Will you shut up!

430
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:28,536
Hey, what about me?

431
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:37,754
Inès, you've been married a lot,

432
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:40,252
using men to put money in the pot.

433
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:43,519
Like the great door of Istanbul.

434
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,209
At least you're not evil,

435
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,778
you give life to these people.

436
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:53,440
But I see suffering.

437
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:54,661
Go on.

438
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:59,836
You want
to learn of the world's cruelty?

439
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,785
Yes. P.R. is my business.

440
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:04,371
So be it.

441
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,211
Cancer will soon strike you down,
and you'll be all alone.

442
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:12,752
You'll never mend it,

443
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:15,813
you'll try 20 times,

444
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,876
but you're too strong to end it.

445
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:21,829
Did you know?

446
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:23,810
Don't believe her.

447
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,593
Rika! Where's my car?

448
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:38,777
Carefully hidden by a good friend.

449
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,481
Near a cliff 'round the bend.

450
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:43,578
That's my girl! She's great!

451
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,076
For redheaded Joëlle,

452
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,957
who works at the hotel!

453
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:52,275
He's gonna knock her up!

454
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:57,103
Think you're slick?
Watch your son's dick.

455
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,054
The redhead is funny,

456
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:02,496
she'll give him a run for his money.

457
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,764
- Let me through.
- No way!

458
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:08,557
I can't let her do it, go through it.

459
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:10,854
Blanche, don't show yourself

460
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:13,839
to these pigs, cads, jerks!

461
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:18,883
- At least explain to me how it works!
- I knew he was trouble!

462
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,389
You have a perfect life,

463
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,179
you love your kids and wife.

464
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:30,782
Your latest joy is a pretty girl.
You gave her a pretty name: Pearl.

465
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:35,030
Hey, that's true! Did you tell her?

466
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,237
The hotel. A rendez-vous!

467
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,723
I'd like a room.

468
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:53,398
We have no rooms free, sir.

469
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,427
- No vacancy.
- Are you sure?

470
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:57,674
Positive, sir.

471
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:00,632
But my cousin the Baroness

472
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:02,722
promised me.

473
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:06,275
- Baroness?
- I stopped at the bank.

474
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:11,563
We only have a suite left for you, sir,

475
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,960
the Imperial Suite.

476
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:16,495
- How much, roughly?
- Pardon?

477
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:18,860
Imperial Suite, royalty,

478
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:21,716
aristocrats don't count money.

479
00:32:22,698 --> 00:32:27,146
I couldn't go backstage,
and now I have to freshen up.

480
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,126
Freshen up?

481
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,002
Bathroom. Price?

482
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:32,466
For what?

483
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,073
Ten minutes.

484
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,407
It's 3,500 francs a night.

485
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:38,796
Sold.

486
00:32:41,764 --> 00:32:43,496
The rest is for you.

487
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:49,658
I love the smartest
and most beautiful girl.

488
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,226
How unusual.

489
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:00,297
The bedroom.

490
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:02,175
The key.

491
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,313
The light switch.

492
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,837
The Atlantic.

493
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:20,448
Next light switch.

494
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:27,020
Next... and next light switch.

495
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,456
Water.

496
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:34,713
Tip.

497
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,989
I got a heart condition.

498
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,137
- Dying soon?
- They don't know.

499
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:47,477
I look ok, but I'm not young.

500
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:50,367
Excuse me, sir.

501
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,727
Drink to your health.

502
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:56,173
I never drink.

503
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:58,786
Where's the master?

504
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,572
And where's Pips?

505
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,138
The ferret.

506
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:30,023
I have to look presentable,

507
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,745
when I'm introduced.

508
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,483
That'll work.
Introduce only me.

509
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,889
The water's hot.

510
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,070
It must have been hot then,

511
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:08,265
weather like this.

512
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,927
Dizzy.

513
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:38,464
If I close my eyes,
the ceiling will fall.

514
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,118
Fatigue, traveling.

515
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,156
I'm drunk with waiting.

516
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:03,547
I was afraid of that.

517
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:12,375
Even as a boy,
Lucas was obsessed with cleanliness.

518
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,779
- How was it, alright?
- Alright? It was cosmic!

519
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:21,150
I'm so happy!

520
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:24,351
- Great!
- Were you... was she there?

521
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:27,067
The Paris Match photo was better.

522
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:30,190
We can do even better, believe me!

523
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,083
See? She doesn't remember,

524
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:36,806
just like me!
Living in the present.

525
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,894
- Did I say something?
- No.

526
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,945
We'll tour that much?

527
00:36:41,194 --> 00:36:44,799
- It's the path...
- The path... of wrath... exit...

528
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:46,819
Anger... erupting...

529
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,393
...new disguise, new dress...

530
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:50,544
...not that...

531
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:55,002
New York is next, then the moon!
We've got it made!

532
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:58,131
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Edwige, it is, I insist!

533
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,235
Tokyo, La Baule, Frisco...
we'll see from there!

534
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:03,525
We'll see!

535
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:06,066
Look who's here.

536
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,851
Who's that?

537
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:13,017
- None of your business.
- That jerk!

538
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:16,539
- You little...
- Let me help.

539
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:19,104
Take this.
It'll calm your nerves.

540
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:26,418
- You came!
- We're all here.

541
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:43,530
- You're all wet.
- I swam here.

542
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:45,172
"Swimming fish."

543
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:48,751
I don't believe you.

544
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:50,807
We're not really here.

545
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:52,610
- Just talk.
- I'm not lying.

546
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,774
You talk well onstage.

547
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,069
Paranomasia...

548
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:59,710
You liked it?
What's that?

549
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:02,939
My heart beating.

550
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:04,446
Let's go.

551
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:08,617
- Lucas.
- Stay here.

552
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,334
I have to talk about the contract...

553
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,469
We have a whole lifetime.

554
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,328
Time... is passing away.

555
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:26,006
- Like you.
- Huh?

556
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,411
I... like you.

557
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:32,034
- I've got to go.
- Can I come?

558
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:34,187
- No one will understand.
- Later?

559
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,717
Yeah, maybe later.

560
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,778
- How?
- I'll find a way.

561
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,718
- You won't lie?
- I will... for you.

562
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:45,668
Which room?

563
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:47,098
The Imperial Suite.

564
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:49,323
Wow, nothing but the best!

565
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:52,347
Yes, nothing.

566
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,159
Suburban idiot.

567
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,425
Sweet swimming swami.

568
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,475
No, that's not it.

569
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,191
Are you crazy?!

570
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,310
He's out of his mind!

571
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,438
There it is...

572
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:30,996
"Somewhere, beyond the sea..."

573
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,171
To leave?

574
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,159
Or not to leave?

575
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:42,486
That is the question.

576
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:46,692
The sea comes, goes, flows...

577
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,708
Waves of alabaster...

578
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,019
Master.

579
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,700
Master of cruel fate and solitude,

580
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:58,309
master of solicitude, anxiety.

581
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:02,318
Dreadful here.

582
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,993
Goddamn meeting.

583
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:09,691
All I need's a silk cravat,
champagne, strawberries,

584
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:12,712
some music, and bam!

585
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,530
Vulgar. Not like my Madame.

586
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,246
What can I do?

587
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:23,146
Wreak havoc, spread confusion!

588
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:27,328
The organized mind
must work in reverse.

589
00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:29,689
Leave nothing in place,

590
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,549
of order I will leave no trace.

591
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:35,159
And so I...

592
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,417
turn upside down...

593
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,500
I lost my degree,

594
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:41,514
and all faith in me.

595
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,200
Should I order a great big meal?

596
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:50,424
She may be eating now.

597
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,365
Turn on the TV.

598
00:40:57,182 --> 00:40:59,163
But how? I don't see.

599
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,715
A silent show, a musical hit,

600
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,680
something clean and fun.

601
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:10,224
I never liked it.

602
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:14,364
After you, my dear!

603
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:18,333
- Watch your step.
- Now for the next step!

604
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:22,264
Private consultations.

605
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:26,847
Only for a select few, you know?
The upper crust.

606
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:29,772
But she can only do it once a day.

607
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:31,899
Hypnosis is tiring.

608
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:35,099
- You don't hypnotize.
- No, I command.

609
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:38,372
- You're full of yourself.
- No, full of life!

610
00:41:38,618 --> 00:41:41,358
- I'm going to sleep.
- I'll wake you tomorrow.

611
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:44,697
You have make-up
and hair appointments.

612
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,663
- Stop fighting and love me!
- Sink or swim,

613
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:51,728
strike while the iron's hot!

614
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,960
That will make or break you!

615
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:57,122
- I'll take you to your room.
- I'll go alone.

616
00:41:57,371 --> 00:41:59,315
Whatever.

617
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,259
Too early to sleep.

618
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,365
- Come on, girls.
- You're ready to dance!

619
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:07,102
It's me.

620
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,412
Sir, a lady's looking
for your suite.

621
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,660
- Pretty?
- Wow.

622
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:14,618
Send her up, or I'll come down.

623
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:17,756
Isn't she the loveliest in town?

624
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:22,061
She keeps saying,
"I'm sick of this shit!"

625
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:23,801
That's her!

626
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:28,293
It's not nice enough here.

627
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:31,603
Throw some water?
Make a lake?

628
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:33,480
It's too late.

629
00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:36,917
My sweet flower,

630
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:39,112
crying at this late hour!

631
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:43,848
You took forever.

632
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:45,311
I never...

633
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:47,354
It was unbearable.

634
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:48,326
My fault.

635
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:49,868
No, mine.

636
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:52,234
I never know what to do.

637
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:55,503
I could do better.

638
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:58,737
It takes me awhile
to come out of it.

639
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,992
We'll figure it out.

640
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:03,679
Shit!

641
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:05,725
That's my word.

642
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:09,943
The door.

643
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,304
The door to what?

644
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:14,495
Close it.

645
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:28,660
Tired.

646
00:43:33,323 --> 00:43:34,711
At last.

647
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,418
At peace.

648
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:40,244
Yes.

649
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,515
Want nothing.

650
00:44:08,427 --> 00:44:09,636
Must nothing.

651
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:12,589
We'll see?

652
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:15,592
The sea.

653
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:42,322
Not asleep?

654
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,744
I was cold.

655
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:45,875
You could close the window.

656
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:47,605
If I moved,

657
00:45:47,963 --> 00:45:49,031
it'd be ruined.

658
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:50,988
- What?
- Sleeping together.

659
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:52,126
All night.

660
00:45:52,765 --> 00:45:53,215
That's right.

661
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:54,949
Crossing a bridge.

662
00:45:55,303 --> 00:45:56,169
Huh?

663
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,813
Playing bridge.

664
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,007
I don't know.

665
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,112
What's it like onstage?

666
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,435
It's something.

667
00:46:07,794 --> 00:46:08,825
I knew it.

668
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,507
Not something... nothing.

669
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,948
A black hole...

670
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:16,866
I'm there, but not really.

671
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:18,253
Where then?

672
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:20,177
- In a kitchen.
- Huh?

673
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,136
- You said, "Huh"!
- And I chew gum.

674
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:26,267
You got some?

675
00:46:26,546 --> 00:46:28,005
Always, in my bag.

676
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:36,972
Are you mad at me?

677
00:46:39,662 --> 00:46:41,679
Because we should've done it?

678
00:46:41,888 --> 00:46:42,896
It's the law.

679
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,297
That's Paris...

680
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:51,346
bad literature, de luxe Parisianism,
gossip and storytelling...

681
00:46:52,117 --> 00:46:54,133
vita brevis, ars lunga...

682
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:56,773
- Life is short, art is long.
- Huh?

683
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:59,518
- I've got a hard-on.
- Me too.

684
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:01,405
Impossible.

685
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,728
When I have to pee,
I get hard.

686
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,205
- "When I see Fernande..."
- My mom's name!

687
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:10,831
Don't be mad.

688
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,284
You do it with your husband?

689
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:17,191
When I have to.

690
00:47:17,445 --> 00:47:20,326
- You don't have to.
- I do what I have to.

691
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:22,801
Do what you want to!

692
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:24,780
Why are you here?

693
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:26,867
That's a good one.

694
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:29,133
I love you.

695
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:31,945
I think I do too.

696
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,223
I do it when I'm unhappy.

697
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:42,030
I threw the lighter at you
when my Mom picked up that guy.

698
00:47:42,146 --> 00:47:43,082
Otherwise...

699
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:44,679
Otherwise...

700
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:48,608
I wanted to be different.

701
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:51,570
Let's not do it anymore.

702
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:54,729
Which one of us will be bored?

703
00:47:56,863 --> 00:47:58,037
Your dick?

704
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:01,065
- My instincts.
- I'm starving!

705
00:48:01,455 --> 00:48:02,914
Let's eat!

706
00:48:08,587 --> 00:48:13,486
We're not doing it,
because you're happy? It's that simple.

707
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,940
- Let me order.
- Yes, master.

708
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:21,274
- That's my college degree.
- Master?

709
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,137
Croissants? Tea?

710
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:27,157
- Hot chocolate?
- Toast! Where's the bathroom?

711
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:28,796
Out of sight, as Dad said.

712
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:30,571
- What'd he do?
- Owned land.

713
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,183
- Phone?
- Out of reach.

714
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:35,859
- Your dad?
- A slave, O master.

715
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:40,618
- His name was Sir Cumference.
- A knight?

716
00:48:41,395 --> 00:48:43,968
Your high hat.
Your Highness.

717
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,538
Your Thickness.
Your Brilliance.

718
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:48,174
Hey, you're big!

719
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,081
Is that Dick speaking?

720
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,030
Dick the prick!

721
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:57,431
Downstairs.

722
00:48:58,094 --> 00:49:01,392
My friend!
One breakfast tray

723
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:05,014
with bread, eggs, fruit,
hot chocolate,

724
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,968
- tea... the best.
- I should think so.

725
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:09,468
Thank you, sir.

726
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,936
- My friend!
- You should've called.

727
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:16,347
And wake the lady?
Sleeping beauty.

728
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,820
There's a phone in the bathroom.

729
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:21,507
It's vulgar to call from the john.

730
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:25,571
- Your syntax is divine.
- And it's all mine.

731
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:28,254
- No one gets it.
- How does it go?

732
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,928
To and fro. It's intense.

733
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,134
If you want intensity, let me know.

734
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,686
But I'm in love.
With a precious gem.

735
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:39,076
Enough banter...

736
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:43,104
She's almost hysterical
when she's in a trance.

737
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,730
The brain, cells, waves...

738
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:50,168
- Like claws.
- No, the signals are weak,

739
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,056
- the sensors blind.
- Leaving us breathless.

740
00:49:53,654 --> 00:49:56,714
Breathing life into the lifeless.

741
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,637
What poetry!
You're a new man, sir!

742
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,392
- I've got to call the Baroness...
- Done, sir.

743
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:05,237
Huh?

744
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:08,329
I called her,
so she wouldn't worry.

745
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,429
Was she happy?

746
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:13,763
Delighted, Mr. Bonneval.

747
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:16,256
Breakfast is on its way.

748
00:50:16,616 --> 00:50:17,790
Don't let me down.

749
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:21,447
Where's the bellboy,
I haven't seen him?

750
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,274
No one knows.
He hasn't shown up.

751
00:50:27,332 --> 00:50:30,072
Sometime soon
I'll have to own up.

752
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:52,170
They came in late.

753
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,778
Him with a lass,
her with a bloke.

754
00:50:55,408 --> 00:50:56,546
They have words,

755
00:50:57,078 --> 00:50:58,501
he looks for her,

756
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:00,834
mother looks for daughter...

757
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,164
Vampire face!

758
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:08,999
I hope his gaze finds no trace.

759
00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:15,200
Excuse me!

760
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,392
François! He's here!

761
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:19,508
He's here, François!

762
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:21,917
You didn't say he was here.

763
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,631
I would never
betray the aristocracy.

764
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:29,986
I'm not used to this.

765
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,448
You can take anything.

766
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:45,257
Room service, Imperial Suite.

767
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:47,557
Two breakfasts.

768
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:49,704
You figure it out.

769
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:52,673
- Why are you running?
- I'm being followed.

770
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,242
Cops?!

771
00:51:55,352 --> 00:51:56,941
Pack your trunk.

772
00:51:57,196 --> 00:52:00,221
- I don't have one.
- Your dress and clippers.

773
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:04,354
When we run,
our shoes go "clip clip."

774
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,590
- What about breakfast?
- I'm hungry.

775
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:09,820
Mom says I'm still growing.

776
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,635
Watch out, they're crazy.

777
00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:17,127
We looked for you all night.
We were worried sick.

778
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:19,253
Afraid I'd leave?

779
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:21,339
What'd that creep do to you?

780
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:24,052
- Lazy losers.
- Loser!

781
00:52:24,298 --> 00:52:26,065
You think I'm a loser?

782
00:52:26,316 --> 00:52:29,685
- Nothing happened!
- What'll I do?

783
00:52:29,795 --> 00:52:32,333
- "Blanche" means white like snow?
- Cold?

784
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:34,689
White like nothing?

785
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:37,197
They're changing my costumes!

786
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:40,126
- I can't stand it.
- Give me that.

787
00:52:40,232 --> 00:52:43,328
I'm gonna look stupid
with dyed hair!

788
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:45,928
You're handsome, François!

789
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:48,501
Calm down.

790
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:51,641
He said my ring was an eyesore.

791
00:52:51,748 --> 00:52:55,294
But it's gold
and has my initials on it.

792
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,912
- What's your name?
- François, like everyone else.

793
00:52:59,019 --> 00:52:59,991
Pathetic.

794
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:02,593
Remember the Cergy supermarket?

795
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,755
- I sure do.
- So funny.

796
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:08,443
- My sales pitch.
- "In the cheese section:

797
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,933
Fresh camembert
that all you ladies will love.

798
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:17,770
It'll remind your men
to wash their feet before dinner."

799
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:19,857
I got fired for that.

800
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:21,945
- I loved it!
- You were so young.

801
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:22,874
I was working.

802
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:25,632
- In the cafeteria.
- You defended me.

803
00:53:25,843 --> 00:53:28,619
- Your father came...
- To beat me, for money.

804
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,895
- I hit him with some honey.
- I don't know.

805
00:53:32,314 --> 00:53:35,434
You cried so hard,
like a fountain.

806
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:37,103
It's easy.

807
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,375
No, it's not easy.

808
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:43,166
He said: A birthmark I had,

809
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:45,499
so I knew he was my dad.

810
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,471
Dads have no value.

811
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:49,149
They beat you.

812
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,717
- Then I lose you.
- Not true.

813
00:53:52,215 --> 00:53:53,709
You see?

814
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,358
Come here.

815
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:12,626
You've got a photo session today...

816
00:54:13,054 --> 00:54:14,157
I'll be there.

817
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:19,276
He's handsome, classy.

818
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,300
- It was good for you.
- Right, Mom.

819
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:24,980
Tablets...

820
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:28,741
All 3 of us got laid.

821
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,814
- You too, Mom?
- Edwige's guy.

822
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:37,050
Get the lead out, François,
she'll catch up.

823
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,643
What're you doing?

824
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:51,765
Going through your bag.

825
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:54,826
- Looking for something?
- Gum.

826
00:54:55,255 --> 00:54:56,749
Did you find it?

827
00:54:58,073 --> 00:54:59,532
I don't like this.

828
00:55:01,517 --> 00:55:03,629
Will these things protect me?

829
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:04,364
From what?

830
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,202
From you.

831
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:08,882
When'd you last have one?

832
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:10,935
While you slept. Why?

833
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:12,921
No reason.

834
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,381
The Mrs. Will sign,
if she can write.

835
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:28,572
Blanche Filthy von Slut!

836
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:35,018
You don't like my family?

837
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:39,466
Not hungry?

838
00:55:40,343 --> 00:55:42,324
Yeah, more than ever.

839
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:57,211
Pass the sugar.

840
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:02,741
No, the sugar.

841
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:12,486
Are you joking?

842
00:56:13,638 --> 00:56:14,954
Joking.

843
00:56:16,212 --> 00:56:17,184
King.

844
00:56:17,813 --> 00:56:19,129
King Midas.

845
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:21,184
Midas touch.

846
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:26,124
Soft touch.

847
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:29,638
Velvet touch.

848
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:33,319
Blue velvet.

849
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:37,603
Velvet blue.

850
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,247
Blue rabbit.

851
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:45,955
Rabbit.

852
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:48,279
Wounded.

853
00:56:49,855 --> 00:56:51,480
Left by the others.

854
00:56:52,778 --> 00:56:53,881
Shit.

855
00:56:55,944 --> 00:56:57,331
Empty.

856
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,454
Tragedy.

857
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,194
Want to drive me crazy?

858
00:57:06,346 --> 00:57:07,521
Crazy...

859
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:10,312
Me.

860
00:57:13,548 --> 00:57:15,102
Fuck off, Lucas.

861
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:23,382
My rabbit!

862
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:35,601
My rabbit!

863
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,254
- She's on drugs.
- They all are.

864
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:18,014
Can I get her autograph?

865
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,266
Oops, I got carried away.

866
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:23,710
- What'd I do?
- Want another?

867
00:58:24,312 --> 00:58:26,114
Stay away from such people!

868
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:32,309
Stay away... path...

869
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:35,818
Don't beat me.

870
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,293
Child.

871
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:45,496
Love me.

872
00:58:46,265 --> 00:58:47,653
Teach me.

873
00:58:49,465 --> 00:58:51,446
I need...

874
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:55,933
so badly.

875
00:58:58,024 --> 00:58:59,684
That girl looks sick.

876
00:58:59,938 --> 00:59:02,820
Don't go there. She's throwing up.

877
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:07,093
Maybe it's indigestion?
That hotel food...

878
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:15,443
See that?
She's eating sand.

879
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:19,552
No silly, she's lost her senses.

880
00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:22,760
Those women!

881
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:27,975
Take my hat, Miss.
You're all wet.

882
00:59:28,222 --> 00:59:31,176
- No, thanks.
- Let me help.

883
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:43,286
- Poor girl.
- Adrienne!

884
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:46,691
Your name's Adrienne?

885
00:59:49,027 --> 00:59:52,668
Look after her, she's not well.

886
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:55,353
I didn't do anything.
Go drown yourself.

887
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,654
What?!

888
01:00:05,971 --> 01:00:07,667
Got some lotion?

889
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:12,818
The sun makes my nose peel.

890
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,874
Have a nice swim?

891
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:20,083
My mother always had lotion.

892
01:00:21,312 --> 01:00:24,159
- Can I look?
- You already did.

893
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:27,327
Don't you remember?

894
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,890
Vaguely.

895
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:35,010
I brought your towel.

896
01:00:39,926 --> 01:00:40,935
I'm sorry.

897
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:49,380
I saw you swimming.

898
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:53,733
- You're not so tall in the water.
- No.

899
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:58,562
- We should never argue.
- No.

900
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:01,808
It tears my heart out.

901
01:01:02,853 --> 01:01:06,957
This is really it, this time.

902
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:12,445
Even if we're different,

903
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:15,368
together we're whole.

904
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:24,771
You're long, and round.

905
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:28,874
- With swimmer's thighs.
- From the pool in Cergy.

906
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,929
- You love swimming?
- I love you.

907
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:34,059
Let's make the most of that.

908
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,640
- Your back's freezing.
- My fingers too?

909
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:39,655
No, stop...

910
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:44,698
- We might drown.
- I want you.

911
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,857
I...

912
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:49,743
want...

913
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:52,871
you!

914
01:02:04,572 --> 01:02:06,719
Get out... of here get out.

915
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,632
The sheets are wet.

916
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:11,174
Doesn't matter, pitter patter,

917
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:14,170
go now, scatter, heathens,

918
01:02:14,835 --> 01:02:16,887
I'm not afraid of water.

919
01:02:16,992 --> 01:02:18,901
Let me redecorate.

920
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:37,620
It feels like the first time.

921
01:02:44,268 --> 01:02:45,964
It's hot in here.

922
01:02:46,077 --> 01:02:48,129
It's cool in here.

923
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,226
Be proud of me.

924
01:03:01,002 --> 01:03:02,176
Tonight...

925
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,755
I'm having an...

926
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,318
eclipse.

927
01:03:24,173 --> 01:03:26,190
Talk to me,

928
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:28,763
like you're in a trance.

929
01:03:29,879 --> 01:03:32,939
Need... so much love.

930
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,145
Give!

931
01:03:38,298 --> 01:03:39,401
I can't.

932
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:42,425
Open!

933
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:55,100
There's a little person
inside the big one.

934
01:04:02,373 --> 01:04:03,476
Yes...

935
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:06,266
body...

936
01:04:10,548 --> 01:04:11,722
intelli...

937
01:04:13,819 --> 01:04:15,242
gence.

938
01:04:19,907 --> 01:04:24,558
They put Blanche
in the black closet without food.

939
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:30,058
Words...

940
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:33,397
and body...

941
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:39,103
Women...

942
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:42,103
The kitty...

943
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:45,472
is dead.

944
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,735
Not dead!

945
01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:53,678
Alive!

946
01:04:54,802 --> 01:04:58,515
That night, he remembers,
we were wandering...

947
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:01,752
and you, you?!

948
01:05:02,457 --> 01:05:03,809
And you?!

949
01:05:04,544 --> 01:05:05,125
The water!

950
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:07,110
I don't want to cry!

951
01:05:07,953 --> 01:05:09,685
- Don't cry!
- Don't!

952
01:05:10,145 --> 01:05:10,726
Love!

953
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:14,317
Cry, love! Pain!

954
01:05:15,016 --> 01:05:16,569
Does it hurt?
Or are you suffering?

955
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:25,866
I understand.

956
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:30,323
Love means pain, lots of pain.

957
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:40,653
Your parents died in a pond at night.

958
01:05:52,137 --> 01:05:55,648
Your parents drowned in a pond.

959
01:06:15,273 --> 01:06:16,767
Heads up!

960
01:06:17,326 --> 01:06:19,307
Head's in, warm inside.

961
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,829
I can feel you.

962
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:37,981
King Arthur's putting the sword

963
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,007
in the stone.

964
01:06:46,793 --> 01:06:48,287
Guenevere

965
01:06:48,602 --> 01:06:51,936
is showing him the way home.

966
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:09,750
We're no more alone.

967
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:20,182
Give.

968
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:22,827
Open.

969
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,305
There it is!

970
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:29,021
Correct.

971
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:36,847
Excuse me.

972
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:42,447
We went fast.

973
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:47,187
You think so?

974
01:07:53,557 --> 01:07:55,633
Believe me,

975
01:07:57,732 --> 01:07:59,048
wave...

976
01:08:00,306 --> 01:08:01,895
came...

977
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,485
from deep inside.

978
01:08:07,195 --> 01:08:08,784
Cannot.

979
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,643
What's that?

980
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:36,792
I asked for room service, to buy...

981
01:08:37,776 --> 01:08:41,180
some shoes,
and tops and bottoms.

982
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:45,351
- You don't know my size.
- I measured like this.

983
01:08:45,777 --> 01:08:47,130
It's gorgeous!

984
01:08:47,378 --> 01:08:48,243
Wanna help me?

985
01:08:48,804 --> 01:08:50,464
They got any old thing.

986
01:08:53,432 --> 01:08:55,092
It looks good on me.

987
01:09:07,661 --> 01:09:09,250
Excuse the delay.

988
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,136
They had to go to town.

989
01:09:11,418 --> 01:09:13,707
You wanted them alive,

990
01:09:14,028 --> 01:09:15,830
the market's closed today.

991
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:17,989
You did want big ones?

992
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,086
She's a big girl.

993
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:23,758
Not too big.

994
01:09:24,256 --> 01:09:25,395
Too big? Big enough?

995
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:27,802
Hope that'll do it.

996
01:09:34,728 --> 01:09:35,867
What's that?!

997
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:38,345
- For your breasts.
- Crabs?

998
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:39,805
I lost the word.

999
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:40,811
Brassière?

1000
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:42,996
I forgot the "-ssière."

1001
01:09:43,217 --> 01:09:44,118
They need water.

1002
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:46,520
The bathtub, maybe?

1003
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:48,781
No, the sea's better,

1004
01:09:49,027 --> 01:09:50,308
while I'm away.

1005
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:53,096
- You're going?
- Got a lunch.

1006
01:09:53,515 --> 01:09:54,974
- Lunchbox?
- Restaurant.

1007
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:58,102
- Soup kitchen?
- No, a fancy place.

1008
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:00,750
You shouldn't go!

1009
01:10:01,204 --> 01:10:01,820
What's wrong?

1010
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:05,615
It's going down the toilet!

1011
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:06,690
What?

1012
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:09,548
Words. Don't ruin them!

1013
01:10:09,797 --> 01:10:11,185
But I have a meeting...

1014
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,787
In that pathetic casino,

1015
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,543
why do you show them your ass,
and crack?

1016
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,032
I...

1017
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:21,164
The faucet's on,
the water's running...

1018
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:23,120
No, turned off it is.

1019
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:27,982
Leave together.

1020
01:10:28,897 --> 01:10:31,115
Bad, bad, bad for you.

1021
01:10:35,438 --> 01:10:37,170
It's my last show in France.

1022
01:10:38,325 --> 01:10:39,297
Will you be back?

1023
01:10:39,821 --> 01:10:42,074
Yes, I know I will.

1024
01:10:42,465 --> 01:10:44,090
Do you still want me?

1025
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,663
You talk in rhymes.

1026
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:53,553
Did they tell you?

1027
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:02,223
Because I pity
that little person, I do.

1028
01:11:04,314 --> 01:11:06,366
We need a computer

1029
01:11:06,575 --> 01:11:08,520
that can hurt others.

1030
01:11:08,663 --> 01:11:10,252
What compassion!

1031
01:11:17,952 --> 01:11:22,223
I walked barefoot
all over France, in the war.

1032
01:11:22,648 --> 01:11:24,071
Which one, honey?

1033
01:11:25,154 --> 01:11:28,249
Wow, you're stunning!

1034
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,971
I love it, don't you?

1035
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,615
Is that the little turd in Paris Match?

1036
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:36,841
You mean "blurb."

1037
01:11:37,296 --> 01:11:41,080
- Turd, blurb, who gives a shit?
- It was the first time!

1038
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:46,751
They colored my hair.

1039
01:11:47,663 --> 01:11:50,260
I'd say they discolored it.

1040
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:55,380
I'll leave Blanche
to your decadence... I mean wisdom.

1041
01:11:56,047 --> 01:11:58,159
- It's nice.
- If you ask me...

1042
01:11:58,587 --> 01:11:59,726
I'm in charge here!

1043
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:02,684
Don't touch the girl.
Give her a beer.

1044
01:12:02,936 --> 01:12:04,359
Stop butting in!

1045
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:09,886
"Haley" is classier than "Halliday,"
or use your real name, "Blanche..."

1046
01:12:09,998 --> 01:12:12,703
Did I say you could use my name?

1047
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:14,336
Blanche!

1048
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:17,224
It's ok, François.

1049
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:20,505
I used to be like that.

1050
01:12:24,646 --> 01:12:26,413
Wild.

1051
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,932
Right, Barnaby?

1052
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:35,662
Incorrigible.

1053
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:41,338
Always right. Really moody.
I manage 400 people.

1054
01:12:41,484 --> 01:12:42,907
Guy knows.

1055
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:47,253
Haley... like the comet.

1056
01:12:49,242 --> 01:12:51,389
- I am really...
- What?

1057
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:54,452
- Sick of it.
- Want me to take care of it?

1058
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:59,191
Call me Blanche Haley, Haley Blanche,

1059
01:12:59,471 --> 01:13:01,131
I want to see Mom, alright?

1060
01:13:01,384 --> 01:13:03,851
What the hell are you doing?

1061
01:13:07,403 --> 01:13:09,419
It's good to stand up to her.

1062
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,063
I need you.

1063
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:20,863
- Oh, it's you!
- Who else?

1064
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:23,056
Waiting for another one?

1065
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:27,087
See you later.

1066
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,310
Why stop? Give it your all.

1067
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,607
Just like when I was small.

1068
01:13:32,035 --> 01:13:33,565
He drank. He couldn't.

1069
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,550
He was unable, you were unstable.

1070
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,643
Instead of your vulgar ways,

1071
01:13:38,924 --> 01:13:42,079
he needed
calm tenderness in his days.

1072
01:13:42,507 --> 01:13:44,795
You're rhyming, dear.

1073
01:13:44,908 --> 01:13:46,924
At age one I saw you,

1074
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,055
the tears, the escapes,

1075
01:13:50,195 --> 01:13:52,900
screaming with a lover above you.

1076
01:13:53,432 --> 01:13:57,429
I also imagined
that love would be suffering.

1077
01:13:58,128 --> 01:14:00,204
I hoped it would change,

1078
01:14:00,598 --> 01:14:04,073
but I can't understand,
it's still too strange!

1079
01:14:05,156 --> 01:14:08,904
These people
are taking over our lives!

1080
01:14:09,018 --> 01:14:11,070
We're making a fortune.

1081
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,412
We'll work something out,
so I won't suffer.

1082
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:18,201
You said you were unconscious?

1083
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:22,479
To make you happy,
to save your conscience.

1084
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:45,715
Was that his maid?

1085
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:49,993
I called her.
It's risky taking a lover.

1086
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:51,908
It's my first time.

1087
01:14:52,193 --> 01:14:53,438
Had enough?

1088
01:14:53,862 --> 01:14:56,495
Got any more of that stuff?

1089
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,289
Screw 'em... and get the hell out!

1090
01:15:01,099 --> 01:15:03,080
Compassion, compassion,

1091
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,595
come on, passion!

1092
01:15:07,396 --> 01:15:09,757
Pass it on, play along, Baroness.

1093
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,911
Let's find a way...

1094
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,606
Your cousin the Baroness is here.

1095
01:15:21,904 --> 01:15:23,885
Does she need a brassiere?

1096
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:26,802
Including the "-ssière."

1097
01:15:27,227 --> 01:15:28,472
I couldn't say.

1098
01:15:28,932 --> 01:15:31,469
One male, one female.
I better hide them.

1099
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:34,561
My deepest respects
to your Highness.

1100
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:53,454
Arthur and Adrienne
are their names.

1101
01:16:06,784 --> 01:16:10,153
Lucas learned about love that day.

1102
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:14,222
When you're tired of loving,

1103
01:16:14,647 --> 01:16:16,520
you throw each other away.

1104
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,402
One goes, then the other.

1105
01:16:28,806 --> 01:16:32,068
All traitors!
Here to knife me in the back?

1106
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,866
I didn't know. Her mom told me.

1107
01:16:36,112 --> 01:16:37,986
Reminds me
of a film about loyalty.

1108
01:16:38,234 --> 01:16:41,081
- Buñuel, I think.
- Why think when you can go?

1109
01:16:41,331 --> 01:16:44,356
- You have to go home.
- House, home,

1110
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:46,298
sell my place and roam.

1111
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:49,431
Find another
with a pretty kitchen.

1112
01:16:49,681 --> 01:16:51,590
About your condition...

1113
01:16:51,698 --> 01:16:53,157
Be a sad husband...

1114
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:54,854
Words are your friend.

1115
01:16:55,108 --> 01:16:57,326
- Open up to language...
- Your own.

1116
01:16:57,926 --> 01:16:59,349
The doctor's waiting!

1117
01:16:59,944 --> 01:17:04,107
I'm so lucky.
Medical advances left and right!

1118
01:17:04,223 --> 01:17:07,319
- Doctor says every day...
- Worse gets worse.

1119
01:17:07,598 --> 01:17:11,311
Please...
I kissed your ass for 7 years.

1120
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:15,588
You replaced my name with yours.

1121
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:19,799
Wait... I can still write...

1122
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:25,895
and spell my name right.

1123
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:32,571
It's not my fault.

1124
01:17:33,551 --> 01:17:36,362
It's just that I really want her.

1125
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:44,052
My language is yours.

1126
01:17:44,302 --> 01:17:46,105
That's right. Thanks.

1127
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:49,344
Now I can go home...

1128
01:17:49,973 --> 01:17:52,025
and enjoy life.

1129
01:17:57,348 --> 01:17:59,365
Now you can die!

1130
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:03,470
Where's the porter?

1131
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:05,581
Napping.

1132
01:18:06,638 --> 01:18:07,609
And you?

1133
01:18:08,099 --> 01:18:09,203
Waiting for you.

1134
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:15,260
He helps me
when I'm missing a word.

1135
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:17,275
What's missing?

1136
01:18:18,223 --> 01:18:19,194
Elevator.

1137
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:21,732
That's a tough one.

1138
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,339
I'll take you there.

1139
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:39,264
You can't charge 20,000 an hour!

1140
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:43,130
Believe me, I'm never wrong.

1141
01:18:43,272 --> 01:18:46,427
If you don't like it, lump it!
L'chaim.

1142
01:18:47,308 --> 01:18:48,897
Know the Jewish Connection?

1143
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,568
If you don't want 2 armed guys
at your place...

1144
01:18:53,918 --> 01:18:55,578
Get the picture?

1145
01:18:57,189 --> 01:19:00,249
Always taking us for a ride!

1146
01:19:00,911 --> 01:19:02,334
What do you think?

1147
01:19:03,555 --> 01:19:07,268
A star is born!
The Biarritz beauty.

1148
01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:09,633
You need to learn English.

1149
01:19:09,852 --> 01:19:12,806
- Dummkopf.
- Dumb ass!

1150
01:19:13,436 --> 01:19:16,769
- My tailor is rich.
- How are you, sweetie?

1151
01:19:17,715 --> 01:19:20,040
- I wanna screw you!
- My turn!

1152
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,994
- I can't get enough.
- Leave us alone!

1153
01:19:23,247 --> 01:19:26,888
- Or you?
- Who do you think you are?!

1154
01:19:27,248 --> 01:19:29,051
You better watch out!

1155
01:19:29,161 --> 01:19:32,707
Watch your filthy habits, old man!

1156
01:19:34,276 --> 01:19:37,466
- I do look old.
- No, distinguished.

1157
01:19:37,928 --> 01:19:42,649
Anyway, you're so pretty,
you intimidate me.

1158
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:45,824
My god, you're gorgeous!

1159
01:19:46,069 --> 01:19:48,014
- How about some music?
- I look ok?

1160
01:19:48,227 --> 01:19:49,851
She'll marry a prince!

1161
01:19:50,106 --> 01:19:53,095
Like I always wanted.
No artists!

1162
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:57,443
Her dress keeps folding.
Tighten the curve of the breast.

1163
01:19:59,325 --> 01:20:02,586
Michel said your friend's not well.

1164
01:20:03,708 --> 01:20:07,599
Damn... how does it work?

1165
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:16,996
Are you crazy?!
Leave me alone!

1166
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:19,463
Thank you so much.

1167
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:22,346
Biarritz! I am never wrong.

1168
01:20:22,599 --> 01:20:25,481
That's right, you got it!

1169
01:20:37,107 --> 01:20:42,042
Even in Moscow,
they'll need psychics.

1170
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:07,297
I've got to go.

1171
01:21:08,419 --> 01:21:10,222
But not for long.

1172
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,899
Blanche not here?

1173
01:21:25,153 --> 01:21:26,256
No.

1174
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:30,047
- Then I'll go to her.
- Really?

1175
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:32,660
Add grease to the fire.

1176
01:21:33,747 --> 01:21:35,691
Lots of grease, please.

1177
01:21:41,018 --> 01:21:42,856
Your kitchen!

1178
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:52,145
"Baucet?"

1179
01:22:17,026 --> 01:22:19,458
Nitty gritty... pretty!

1180
01:22:20,401 --> 01:22:21,575
I know.

1181
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:25,434
House, pond, noise...

1182
01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:27,600
I love you!

1183
01:22:28,298 --> 01:22:29,793
We ate like sad boys.

1184
01:22:30,282 --> 01:22:31,253
Fighter!

1185
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:33,367
The spider... is sad.

1186
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:34,871
Time, I know.

1187
01:22:35,222 --> 01:22:36,123
Don't go.

1188
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:39,666
I need better hands, give me some.

1189
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,246
No.

1190
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:44,329
Come.

1191
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:48,024
- You must.
- Move not.

1192
01:22:48,442 --> 01:22:51,147
- Love.
- Cold in here.

1193
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:54,911
- Stay near.
- Like me best, how I'm dressed?

1194
01:22:55,713 --> 01:22:59,426
- Your jewels, your gown?
- Don't let me down.

1195
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:01,835
Is one woman too much?

1196
01:23:04,794 --> 01:23:06,288
Ecstasy again?

1197
01:23:06,533 --> 01:23:08,122
Talk.

1198
01:23:08,377 --> 01:23:09,622
Come...

1199
01:23:11,543 --> 01:23:13,038
Oh, come.

1200
01:23:15,544 --> 01:23:16,789
Suffer, then.

1201
01:23:29,391 --> 01:23:31,336
I'm coming!

1202
01:23:34,644 --> 01:23:38,084
When I go,
don't forget the love of Blanche,

1203
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:41,531
it'll stay with you
long after tonight.

1204
01:23:41,811 --> 01:23:44,966
With or without her, empty space

1205
01:23:45,464 --> 01:23:47,445
without words.

1206
01:23:48,038 --> 01:23:51,264
One last vision she'll have for you.

1207
01:23:53,849 --> 01:23:55,830
Turn away and you'll forget.

1208
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:14,087
Was she here?

1209
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:17,048
No, sir.

1210
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,854
So I must go.

1211
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:20,770
It's time.

1212
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:32,809
A big blue rabbit!

1213
01:24:44,365 --> 01:24:46,309
Your ticket, sir.

1214
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:50,034
Your software.

1215
01:24:50,244 --> 01:24:51,560
My soft wear.

1216
01:24:51,914 --> 01:24:53,681
It's heaven-sent.

1217
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:55,871
Certainly, sir.

1218
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,975
For your ten cents.

1219
01:25:01,168 --> 01:25:03,494
Glad to be of service.

1220
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:10,245
Tonight, the lady
has become a true princess.

1221
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,579
It's you... and what you do.

1222
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,682
She smells the sweet smell of love.

1223
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:20,328
- Gum?
- Got some.

1224
01:25:23,156 --> 01:25:27,225
This extraordinary woman
needs no introduction.

1225
01:25:27,644 --> 01:25:31,084
The divine Blanche Haley!

1226
01:25:35,924 --> 01:25:38,035
Bravo!

1227
01:25:38,186 --> 01:25:41,661
You're back, Mr. Le Comte...
you're not going to...

1228
01:25:42,186 --> 01:25:44,891
Love is a pond that can drown you.

1229
01:25:45,387 --> 01:25:47,463
You think so?

1230
01:25:52,623 --> 01:25:57,214
The porter told me
about your credits as a scientist.

1231
01:25:57,459 --> 01:25:59,820
It'd be wise to keep quiet.

1232
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:01,697
Mark my words.

1233
01:26:01,983 --> 01:26:05,696
And her guru, François.

1234
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:13,528
That makes it even tougher.

1235
01:26:41,678 --> 01:26:43,695
Watch my finger, Blanche.

1236
01:27:12,156 --> 01:27:13,923
Words...

1237
01:27:16,121 --> 01:27:18,197
and body.

1238
01:27:34,943 --> 01:27:36,082
This gentleman!

1239
01:27:40,092 --> 01:27:43,283
This little man,
I can't really use him,

1240
01:27:44,197 --> 01:27:47,459
he always needs
something new to amuse him.

1241
01:27:48,338 --> 01:27:51,007
Paying for love,
a slave to perversion,

1242
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:54,525
he gets off in his armchair

1243
01:27:54,634 --> 01:27:57,695
and thinks he knows passion.

1244
01:27:57,835 --> 01:28:00,825
He smells, likes porno,
has no wife,

1245
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:03,988
I should give him my skin,

1246
01:28:04,272 --> 01:28:08,827
as a balm
for his sorry excuse for a life.

1247
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:12,509
This man has the power

1248
01:28:13,387 --> 01:28:15,569
to kill the artist.

1249
01:28:16,622 --> 01:28:20,263
The artist must bow down,
not go too far.

1250
01:28:20,693 --> 01:28:23,718
This man can do everything,
wreak havoc.

1251
01:28:24,415 --> 01:28:27,476
The enlightening child
must be corrupted,

1252
01:28:27,721 --> 01:28:31,125
the pathetic spirit must run wild.

1253
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:34,224
We must flatter fate,

1254
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:37,424
raise praise as directed, not hate.

1255
01:28:39,654 --> 01:28:41,730
Sir, please excuse me.

1256
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:44,315
You were chosen from many.

1257
01:28:45,047 --> 01:28:48,937
There are others here,
far worse than you.

1258
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:54,751
And others who are honest, kind,
sentimental and sweet,

1259
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:58,161
the kind of people
I'm touched to meet.

1260
01:28:58,406 --> 01:29:02,403
They think that life
is more than just lies.

1261
01:29:04,459 --> 01:29:06,642
And some are innocent.

1262
01:29:11,487 --> 01:29:13,954
Can we trade words for innocence?

1263
01:29:23,246 --> 01:29:27,066
You've got to go,
quietly, discreetly.

1264
01:29:29,683 --> 01:29:31,699
Expect nothing from me.

1265
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,762
Me, Lucas, them.

1266
01:29:38,554 --> 01:29:42,231
If you don't go, Lucas,
I'll speak no more.

1267
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:45,161
You've got just a few hours,

1268
01:29:45,408 --> 01:29:49,335
you won't see the dawn,
I won't cry like before.

1269
01:29:49,757 --> 01:29:52,390
I won't cry for you.

1270
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:55,977
It's best to go
when it's really good.

1271
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:59,457
You're killing my act,
killing me.

1272
01:29:59,881 --> 01:30:02,835
I'm making up poems
to make you happy.

1273
01:30:03,082 --> 01:30:04,955
The child is dying to speak...

1274
01:30:05,204 --> 01:30:06,175
Tell him!

1275
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:09,126
I have to be honest in what I say.

1276
01:30:09,448 --> 01:30:14,276
Merchandise wins,
the blade cuts the foreskin at the end.

1277
01:30:14,563 --> 01:30:15,393
Her, there!

1278
01:30:15,641 --> 01:30:18,523
Her child won a word contest.

1279
01:30:18,807 --> 01:30:19,637
In her bag?

1280
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,988
A checkbook, of course.

1281
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:24,821
- Number?
- 792832000.

1282
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:27,955
- Is that correct, Ma'am?
- It is.

1283
01:30:28,165 --> 01:30:31,949
Just in case,
she's got one big condom.

1284
01:30:32,062 --> 01:30:35,608
Looking for love
with a black stallion.

1285
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:44,507
You, Lucas, me, Blanche.

1286
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:51,088
Want to see me dance?

1287
01:30:51,928 --> 01:30:53,280
Will I finish school?

1288
01:30:53,702 --> 01:30:57,212
With top honors,
you'll be the best.

1289
01:30:57,459 --> 01:31:01,386
You'll get married
but she won't pass the test.

1290
01:31:02,852 --> 01:31:07,229
Now that I've loved,
I don't have the ears

1291
01:31:07,653 --> 01:31:10,843
for your little secrets
or deepest fears.

1292
01:31:11,411 --> 01:31:14,471
You have no power over me.

1293
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:19,371
I may one day miss
the gift of my talent,

1294
01:31:19,795 --> 01:31:23,649
the glory
of expressing myself to you.

1295
01:31:28,597 --> 01:31:32,665
Glory, in the sea's luster,

1296
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,757
appears lackluster.

1297
01:31:37,852 --> 01:31:40,556
And all that's left...

1298
01:31:41,922 --> 01:31:43,346
is charm.

1299
01:31:48,672 --> 01:31:51,661
The charm of a short life.

1300
01:32:02,797 --> 01:32:05,085
Blanche, what's wrong?

1301
01:32:11,598 --> 01:32:14,338
You'll die alone
in a retirement home,

1302
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:17,433
dirty, poor, forgotten.

1303
01:32:19,983 --> 01:32:23,529
A triumph! Call the press!

1304
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:25,857
I'm never wrong!

1305
01:32:27,915 --> 01:32:29,160
My life's a waste.

1306
01:32:32,438 --> 01:32:35,355
No matter what you think.

1307
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,594
Even if I know now...

1308
01:32:44,546 --> 01:32:50,975
that I take and give of my soul,
out of pity for that small person.

1309
01:32:54,983 --> 01:32:57,130
That person in so much pain.

1310
01:32:58,044 --> 01:33:00,617
The person who makes me whole!

1311
01:33:04,306 --> 01:33:08,541
Why don't you lose your mind
now, Lucas? Why wait?

1312
01:33:15,996 --> 01:33:21,037
Ladies and gentlemen,
her powers rain on us like showers!

1313
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:24,414
Power play, tower of power, flower!

1314
01:33:25,355 --> 01:33:28,201
We are crushing this flower!

1315
01:33:28,799 --> 01:33:32,345
- Mr. Le Comte!
- This way.

1316
01:33:32,487 --> 01:33:35,547
Must you depart and despair?

1317
01:33:36,175 --> 01:33:41,252
Just before dawn,
we'll say good-bye. I'll be there.

1318
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:46,991
What did you say to her?

1319
01:33:48,177 --> 01:33:51,439
That dove is a bond
in which you can clown.

1320
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:59,447
If there's a pure soul here,

1321
01:33:59,554 --> 01:34:02,709
please raise your hand high.

1322
01:34:02,963 --> 01:34:04,066
I'll look for the good.

1323
01:34:05,259 --> 01:34:06,398
No one?

1324
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:10,962
Ok, let's see.

1325
01:34:11,383 --> 01:34:12,592
You're 5 years old.

1326
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,731
As one often does,
you miss the way it was.

1327
01:34:16,844 --> 01:34:19,762
You want to see
your grandparents less.

1328
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,800
Your first love will last
all your life.

1329
01:34:26,726 --> 01:34:28,802
Because that's the way...

1330
01:34:29,404 --> 01:34:31,871
of happiness without strife.

1331
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:37,085
I forgot, your Granddad
has a surprise:

1332
01:34:38,171 --> 01:34:42,478
A doll outfit.
Today is your name day.

1333
01:34:42,973 --> 01:34:45,475
It's at home on your pillow.

1334
01:34:50,731 --> 01:34:52,190
What a recovery,

1335
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,834
she saved the show!

1336
01:34:55,079 --> 01:34:57,024
Nantes was almost a no-go.

1337
01:34:57,271 --> 01:35:00,640
I'm never wrong.

1338
01:35:05,308 --> 01:35:07,775
Bunch of vultures!

1339
01:35:09,518 --> 01:35:12,816
The lining, right.
Smoother now.

1340
01:35:13,032 --> 01:35:15,701
Time to tango, mamba!

1341
01:35:15,954 --> 01:35:20,022
Incredible!
Wait 'till she hits the gay clubs.

1342
01:35:20,268 --> 01:35:23,044
Then François can strip, right?

1343
01:35:23,295 --> 01:35:26,700
Alter this!
Photographers coming!

1344
01:35:27,713 --> 01:35:29,373
I want to find Lucas.

1345
01:35:29,662 --> 01:35:31,915
Don't forget, your contract!

1346
01:35:35,055 --> 01:35:36,714
Was that true?

1347
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:40,229
I don't know.

1348
01:35:40,864 --> 01:35:42,180
If so, I'll do it!

1349
01:35:43,126 --> 01:35:44,098
Go ahead.

1350
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:46,145
The guy is crazy!

1351
01:35:46,396 --> 01:35:47,368
I'm a star.

1352
01:35:47,648 --> 01:35:50,459
- Will you stop?
- The truth hurts.

1353
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:54,743
Now get the hell out,
you filthy bastards!

1354
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,041
All this will soon be superfluous.

1355
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:05,457
Lucky for you, lesbian.

1356
01:36:05,739 --> 01:36:07,993
That's right, I'm lucky.

1357
01:36:08,975 --> 01:36:11,371
You were always clean, pretty.

1358
01:36:12,176 --> 01:36:14,085
You had everything.

1359
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:15,506
Not now!

1360
01:36:16,421 --> 01:36:19,232
You said I'd be happy
with you here.

1361
01:36:25,013 --> 01:36:26,994
Only love yourself.

1362
01:36:27,692 --> 01:36:29,008
No danger in that.

1363
01:36:29,537 --> 01:36:32,169
To love yourself,
you need a mirror.

1364
01:36:32,911 --> 01:36:36,765
An insurmountable, obscene
same-sex image.

1365
01:36:37,329 --> 01:36:39,274
What do I do onstage?

1366
01:36:40,217 --> 01:36:42,577
Beautiful things, great things,

1367
01:36:43,105 --> 01:36:44,421
definitive things.

1368
01:36:44,774 --> 01:36:48,701
I've got to go, Inès.
Lucas hurts me so, it stings.

1369
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:51,099
Can I come with you?

1370
01:36:55,629 --> 01:36:57,053
Not tonight.

1371
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:03,416
Mr. Le Comte,
you have to get ready!

1372
01:37:04,328 --> 01:37:07,483
I am ready.
Look, white gloves

1373
01:37:07,946 --> 01:37:09,890
and a fancy pop hat.

1374
01:37:10,763 --> 01:37:13,301
You see,
sometimes words pass me by.

1375
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:15,037
Words are strange...

1376
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:19,529
Sartre was inspired
to write about them all.

1377
01:37:19,983 --> 01:37:22,901
Sometimes I feel
I'm against a wall.

1378
01:37:23,183 --> 01:37:26,303
Another of Sartre's pieces,
he couldn't write at all.

1379
01:37:26,593 --> 01:37:31,005
I want to have my final moment.

1380
01:37:31,847 --> 01:37:33,092
Set up in a room.

1381
01:37:33,516 --> 01:37:36,612
A fine idea!
The porter will help us.

1382
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,514
Not too much trouble?

1383
01:37:38,979 --> 01:37:42,906
I died 2 days ago.
Nothing more will harm us.

1384
01:38:08,933 --> 01:38:10,629
Impeccable style!

1385
01:38:11,543 --> 01:38:13,559
Style running wild.

1386
01:38:18,432 --> 01:38:20,021
It really flows!

1387
01:38:20,796 --> 01:38:21,805
It's the water.

1388
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:02,154
I came to say good-bye.

1389
01:39:06,651 --> 01:39:10,435
Maybe... water... too much...

1390
01:39:10,965 --> 01:39:11,866
No talk.

1391
01:39:12,774 --> 01:39:13,983
No moving.

1392
01:39:15,384 --> 01:39:16,771
Sleep.

1393
01:39:18,132 --> 01:39:19,935
My flight's leaving.

1394
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,952
- When?
- Before dawn.

1395
01:39:24,847 --> 01:39:26,864
Man wants to change woman.

1396
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,735
She'll never change.

1397
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:47,217
Ok, there!

1398
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:50,729
Talk, please...

1399
01:39:51,183 --> 01:39:53,472
- One last time!
- That hurts!

1400
01:39:53,723 --> 01:39:56,119
Help me, please.

1401
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,496
You shouldn't do that!

1402
01:40:07,221 --> 01:40:10,246
You shouldn't
hurt the little person!

1403
01:40:19,607 --> 01:40:22,869
When it's all over, you'll die.

1404
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:27,189
Men die by the sword,
you'll die by your brain.

1405
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:29,795
But you'll die happy.

1406
01:40:30,427 --> 01:40:32,574
Kind, stupid,
you'll end your pain.

1407
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:37,138
Cold intelligence
makes a person seem wild,

1408
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,858
but the only true justice
is that of a child.

1409
01:40:57,181 --> 01:40:59,090
I hate you now.

1410
01:41:16,037 --> 01:41:17,009
Pain!

1411
01:42:04,849 --> 01:42:06,308
Help me.

1412
01:42:06,658 --> 01:42:08,390
Love me.

1413
01:42:23,288 --> 01:42:24,711
Love.

1414
01:42:26,837 --> 01:42:27,940
Didn't know.

1415
01:42:28,576 --> 01:42:29,999
Know...

1416
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:33,714
we can't.

1417
01:42:40,857 --> 01:42:42,873
Use the verb "to smurf,"

1418
01:42:43,154 --> 01:42:44,648
it's easier.

1419
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:47,605
I'll smurf the lights,

1420
01:42:48,163 --> 01:42:50,701
you smurf the lady in your arms.

1421
01:42:51,538 --> 01:42:54,420
I'll smurf her onto your back.

1422
01:42:58,217 --> 01:42:59,605
Love...

1423
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:01,655
or misery.

1424
01:43:08,203 --> 01:43:10,635
We must learn to share.

1425
01:43:12,691 --> 01:43:14,351
At our age!

1426
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,320
Rabbit!

1427
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:22,489
Thank you...

1428
01:43:22,641 --> 01:43:25,630
but they're all anxious, waiting.

1429
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,971
That way, Mr. Le Comte.
No charge to your account.

1430
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:32,167
If I may say so.

1431
01:43:32,974 --> 01:43:34,634
The lady is drunk...

1432
01:43:35,061 --> 01:43:36,556
with success, right?

1433
01:43:37,774 --> 01:43:38,806
She's sleeping.

1434
01:43:40,836 --> 01:43:42,259
Aren't we all?

1435
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:45,564
Don't let me go.

1436
01:43:58,579 --> 01:44:01,152
The motorcycle
is waiting outside.

1437
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:06,369
Don't worry about the bill.
Your Highness the Baroness...

1438
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:09,118
He'll thank his cousin later.

1439
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:11,685
You even have a voucher.

1440
01:44:12,704 --> 01:44:14,922
- Here.
- It's all yours.

1441
01:44:15,384 --> 01:44:17,257
For buying the gum.

1442
01:44:20,184 --> 01:44:22,545
Are you making fun?

1443
01:44:24,742 --> 01:44:26,130
He who chews...

1444
01:44:27,282 --> 01:44:28,776
cannot laugh.

1445
01:44:48,052 --> 01:44:51,207
Come on, sir! Gas, clutch,

1446
01:44:51,426 --> 01:44:53,858
gears... it's child’s' play!

1447
01:44:54,244 --> 01:44:57,055
No, I can't smurf.

1448
01:44:57,654 --> 01:45:00,465
Smurf the metal from my cotton.

1449
01:45:04,716 --> 01:45:05,996
You can pipe it.

1450
01:45:06,456 --> 01:45:08,081
Just like I always wanted.

1451
01:45:10,004 --> 01:45:12,021
Good-fly, guy.

1452
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:21,308
My diversion
will save the artists from detection!

1453
01:45:43,717 --> 01:45:47,157
My love... shall we so?

1454
01:46:30,232 --> 01:46:33,981
Like the current
flowing into the river,

1455
01:46:34,685 --> 01:46:38,540
like Blanche, awakening,
in love with her lover.

1456
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:42,888
By accident,
not knowing where or when,

1457
01:46:43,869 --> 01:46:48,353
they'll complete the circle
as children again.

1458
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,132
I kept this for you.

1
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,141
Roberto.

2
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:54,435
Roberto.

3
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:57,582
Look, You can level with me.

4
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:58,899
I had a bad scene, huh?

5
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,585
You're missing your cues, that's all.

6
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,693
You gotta follow me.

7
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,257
Don't hassle yourself, Mirko.

8
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,176
Everything is okay.

9
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,761
We're so far out, who's gonna notice?

10
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,095
Thanks, man.

11
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,371
- Yeah.
- See you.

12
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,143
Mirko.

13
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:28,095
Son of a bitch.

14
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,014
Hey.

15
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,116
Just a minute.

16
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,951
What do you want?

17
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,535
Take your hands off me.

18
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,619
That's cute?

19
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,662
What do I want?

20
00:05:59,686 --> 00:06:00,747
What the hell do you want?

21
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,915
You've been following
me for maybe a week now.

22
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,709
I'm sick of seeing your stupid face.

23
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:05,793
Now what are you after?

24
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:07,420
Are you crazy?

25
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:08,963
I don't know what you're talking about.

26
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:11,424
I've never followed anybody.

27
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,011
What are you after, man?

28
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,035
What's your trip?

29
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,517
Lay off me, will you?

30
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,541
Lay off!

31
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:29,859
I'm not fooling, see.

32
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,778
Now, beat it!

33
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:33,136
I'm warning you.

34
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:51,857
Hello?

35
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:56,153
Hello?

36
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,491
Go to hell.

37
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:11,920
Are you still awake?

38
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,129
Yes.

39
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,803
Good night, good morning.

40
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,930
Whatever the case may be.

41
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,202
Who was it?

42
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,226
Nobody.

43
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,105
Never said anything.

44
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,671
<i>UNIDENTIFIED BODY FOUND IN RIVER</i>

45
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,132
<i>THE VICTIM HAD NO ID
AND WAS STABBED TO DEATH</i>

46
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,867
Bye, bye.

47
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:07,891
Goodbye, ma'am.

48
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,257
You can take them back

49
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:23,467
and don't make the same mistake again.

50
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,012
Mmm.

51
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:28,180
I'd like to see you in my shoes,

52
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,290
with all this mail to deliver.

53
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:31,559
- Hi.
- Hi, Maria.

54
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,393
What's happening?

55
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,228
Oh, that nitwit

56
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,295
He's always making mistakes.

57
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:37,982
Sometimes it's really embarrassing.

58
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,443
Keeps giving me that old
cripple's mail orders.

59
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:43,237
You know what kind of mail Rambaldi gets?

60
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,947
Swedish pornography.

61
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,098
You wouldn't believe
some of the positions.

62
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,870
ITALIAN IDENTITY CARD ISSUED TO MR.
CARLO MAROSI

63
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,067
Hey, Roberto.

64
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,509
What are you doing?

65
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,821
Nothing.

66
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:26,471
Why don't you come over here with us?

67
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,991
- Yes, tonight.
- Okay, listen.

68
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:30,392
I gotta tell you what I saw.

69
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,913
- What's that?
- An execution

70
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:34,955
in Saudi-Arabia.

71
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:36,123
It sounds gory.

72
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:37,867
They're still chopping
off the heads there

73
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,861
This poor guy got his
hands tied behind his back

74
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:44,965
and they forced him onto his knees

75
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:46,866
in the center of this enormous square.

76
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:50,012
Then, the executioner arrives.

77
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,973
He's got this huge
sword in his right hand,

78
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:56,727
and a real thin stiletto in his left.

79
00:11:56,751 --> 00:12:00,689
First, he takes the stiletto
and jabs it as hard as he can

80
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,650
into the nape of the guy's neck.

81
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:06,987
The whole body jerks rigid
and before you know it,

82
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,490
the executioner's raised his sword,

83
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,951
the neck's stiff, a nice clean cut

84
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:12,785
and off with his head.

85
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:13,809
Ew.

86
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,813
Oh my God, how horrible.

87
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:21,127
Who brought him here?

88
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:22,294
Andrea.

89
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,296
Why don't you tell us what
you've been writing lately?

90
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,132
Alright.

91
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,216
Here's a fascinating story,

92
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,117
Something right up Mirko's alley.

93
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:33,097
It's about the funeral
of a famous French chef.

94
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:36,517
The service is attended by
cooks from all over the world.

95
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,602
It's a beautiful and moving ceremony.

96
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:41,230
Just as the coffin is about to be closed,

97
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:44,525
the mourners sprinkled parsley and paprika

98
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,402
over the deceased.

99
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:50,013
Well, at least that
isn't as gory.

100
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,893
I could kill you now,

101
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,144
but I won't.

102
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,168
I'll wait.

103
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,065
Who is going to help you?

104
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:12,674
The police perhaps?

105
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:15,903
You can't ask anyone.

106
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:17,345
You're all alone.

107
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,351
What's the matter?

108
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,375
Nothing.

109
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,129
Nothing.

110
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,778
I couldn't sleep.

111
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:40,802
Go back to bed.

112
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:42,930
I heard noises.

113
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,808
I said it was nothing.

114
00:17:56,944 --> 00:17:57,944
No.

115
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,323
There's something wrong.

116
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,870
You've been acting so strange.

117
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Please.

118
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:20,968
You can tell me.

119
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,598
Something is wrong.

120
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:29,704
These last few days-

121
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,872
I told you, it was nothing.

122
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:37,484
I killed a man.

123
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:41,197
A couple of days ago I killed a man.

124
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,586
What does he want from you?

125
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:57,879
I don't know.

126
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,776
That's what's so crazy.

127
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,218
He's never asked for money,

128
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:07,932
but he threatens me, phone
calls, letters, photos,

129
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,851
souvenirs.

130
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:13,980
And tonight he nearly killed me.

131
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,482
Look.

132
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:19,436
I have everything right here.

133
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:25,115
It's all gone.

134
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,638
Sure!

135
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:30,722
That's why he came.

136
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:31,746
He took them.

137
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:37,503
Are you sure that guy is really dead?

138
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:40,274
I stabbed him, didn't I?

139
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,633
Besides it was in the papers the next day.

140
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,386
Did they give his full name?

141
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:47,364
Well, no it-

142
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,807
it just said an unidentified body.

143
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:56,188
You don't believe me.

144
00:19:58,232 --> 00:19:59,734
Maybe it's all a bad dream.

145
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:06,008
You've been working awfully hard lately.

146
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:07,175
Listen.

147
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:09,011
Tomorrow we can go see Enrico.

148
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:10,137
He's a good friend.

149
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:10,971
Yeah?

150
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:11,995
He's a shrink, too

151
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,516
You think I'm crazy, huh?

152
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,101
I didn't mean that.

153
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,769
Yeah, okay. Okay. Go to bed.

154
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:18,793
Leave me alone.

155
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,089
Go on! Leave me alone!

156
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:38,438
Roberto.

157
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,567
What was the name of the man you killed?

158
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,195
Carlo Marosi.

159
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,175
This must be his.

160
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,408
The initials are C.M.

161
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:52,721
And it's stained with blood.

162
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:54,640
Where did you find it?

163
00:20:54,664 --> 00:20:57,375
On my dresser.

164
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,935
What are we gonna do?

165
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,812
I can't go to the police.

166
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,031
I can't tell anyone.

167
00:21:22,283 --> 00:21:23,326
What are we gonna do?

168
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,370
Let's run away.

169
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,375
Let's get away from here.

170
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:34,921
It's the only way.

171
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:04,903
Do you know where God is?

172
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:07,364
You surprise me, brother.

173
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,825
God is here,

174
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:12,035
he is there,

175
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,161
and he's everywhere.

176
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:15,622
And he's fishing down by the river.

177
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:17,249
Hey, buddy.

178
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:19,316
You got a 100 Lira to spare?

179
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:22,403
I've got 50.

180
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:25,573
It ain't much but it'll do.

181
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:31,263
God.

182
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:36,834
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

183
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:43,424
Oh, for Christ sake, Godfrey.

184
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:45,235
Godfrey, not God.

185
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,487
What the hell is wrong with Godfrey?

186
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:48,989
Think of something else to call me,

187
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:50,431
something less appropriate.

188
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:53,034
If you're gonna call me God,

189
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:55,745
at least you can call me God almighty?

190
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,164
God almighty?

191
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:58,623
What do you want?

192
00:22:58,647 --> 00:22:59,647
Just slumming.

193
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:01,650
Slumming my ass.

194
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,069
Mmm, come on.

195
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:07,406
How many did you catch?

196
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,594
Four.

197
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:13,138
Nowadays the water's so polluted,

198
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:14,497
they're too pitiful to eat.

199
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:17,559
You catch them, all you wanna do is

200
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,187
put them in the bed and call the doctor.

201
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:22,940
Hey, Jerk Off!

202
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,774
What I do?

203
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:25,609
No, not you.

204
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,443
Not you.

205
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,277
The parrot.

206
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:29,446
That's my food, Jerk Off.

207
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,533
That's why he's called Jerk Off.

208
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:34,534
No kidding.

209
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,036
Somebody gave him to me.

210
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,621
Said that was the name he was born with,

211
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:39,539
so I couldn't really change it.

212
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:41,917
Still, I guess it's not very elegant.

213
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:44,169
We'll never crash high society

214
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:45,087
What an introduction.

215
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:48,423
"My dear, I'd like you to meet Jerk off."

216
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,980
You've got a problem.

217
00:23:55,004 --> 00:23:56,440
I'll say.

218
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,464
Mm.

219
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,778
You see, I killed this guy
and now someone's after me.

220
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:02,802
Is that all?

221
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:05,741
No games.

222
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:06,765
I'm serious.

223
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,729
Okay, what happened?

224
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:15,316
What do I do with this?

225
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:17,026
Put it in your mouth and eat it.

226
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,421
It's raw?

227
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,256
It's good for you

228
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,407
Higher quantities of phosphorus,
protein and all that crap.

229
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:27,536
I'm not much for microbiotics.

230
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:30,331
Just as I suspected.

231
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,293
The typical victim of
the consumer society.

232
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:43,426
It's like this

233
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:46,723
I killed this guy,
I didn't even know him.

234
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:48,099
It was an accident.

235
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:50,559
The police don't know about it,

236
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,145
but somebody else does.

237
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,648
Someone who was there.

238
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:59,151
Took pictures of me killing him.

239
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:01,362
Now they're blackmailing me.

240
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:03,006
But that's not all.

241
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,115
It isn't just anyone.

242
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:07,451
It's someone who knows me pretty well.

243
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,788
One night some friends were at the house

244
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:13,683
and I found one of those damned photos

245
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:15,185
stuck in between the records.

246
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,937
Half an hour before it wasn't there,

247
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:19,223
one of them must have put it there.

248
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:21,191
You gonna pay up?

249
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:22,526
I got no money.

250
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,529
What about your wife, you
said her family's got money.

251
00:25:25,553 --> 00:25:26,822
He's not after money.

252
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:28,323
That's what's so weird.

253
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:31,058
He's just making my life a
hell and I don't know why.

254
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,185
Nasty business.

255
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:38,500
Now, take God's advice.

256
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:41,819
First, get yourself a private investigator

257
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,548
Have 'em check around.

258
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,800
Tail you. Protect you, too.

259
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:48,760
'Cause if I'm not mistaken, and I'm not,

260
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:50,637
your life is in danger.

261
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,413
Arrosio is a good private dick.

262
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:56,768
A bit eccentric, but he's smart and cheap.

263
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:59,938
Second, get the professor
to watch your house.

264
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:00,962
The professor?

265
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:02,881
Yeah.

266
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:05,968
You know him.

267
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:09,221
He's always lying around
here in the hammock

268
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:13,684
We call him professor
because of his elegant ways.

269
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,353
He kisses the ladies' hands,

270
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:18,874
he don't pick his nose in public-

271
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:23,170
And I know 1,280 verses
from the Bible by heart.

272
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,194
What's that?

273
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:27,114
Let's say, for a thou,

274
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,720
okay, a thou-five a day.

275
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:33,597
I want you to keep an eye on
the house of my friend here.

276
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,265
He's a great musician.

277
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,686
Hey, you're blushing?

278
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,188
Who's blushing?

279
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,190
You're turning red,
ain't he professor?

280
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:46,634
As red as the Kremlin.

281
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:48,695
If you see anything strange,

282
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:51,198
like blackmailers, murderers, or the like-

283
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:52,431
I step in, right?

284
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,243
Wrong, you tell us.

285
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:56,328
Oh.

286
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:57,204
Fish?

287
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,038
Huh?

288
00:26:58,062 --> 00:26:58,872
Can I have a fish.

289
00:26:58,896 --> 00:26:59,706
Oh.

290
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,730
No.

291
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:17,039
You, bastard, you!

292
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,815
What do you want from me?

293
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,610
What do you want?

294
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,988
Special delivery.

295
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,012
Eh?

296
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:48,171
I've got a special delivery letter.

297
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:49,006
I never-

298
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,364
I'm sorry, I thought you-

299
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,533
What do you want from me now?

300
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:53,677
Nothing.

301
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,512
You don't understand.

302
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:55,804
I don't understand?

303
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:58,223
You mugged me, you tried to kill me.

304
00:27:58,247 --> 00:27:59,432
You nearly strangled me.

305
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:01,584
What's everyone got against mailmen, huh?

306
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,013
I'm no fool.

307
00:28:15,222 --> 00:28:18,034
Besides, all the evidence I've got here,

308
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:19,058
I saw you.

309
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:22,145
Yes.

310
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:24,148
That's right.

311
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,151
Yes, exactly.

312
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
In cash.

313
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:35,969
Look, I don't care why you're doing it,

314
00:28:35,993 --> 00:28:37,828
I'm only interested in the money.

315
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:42,207
And don't try any funny business
or I'll go to the police.

316
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Understand?

317
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,091
You know the playground in the park?

318
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:54,803
I'll be waiting for you there.

319
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:57,013
This afternoon.

320
00:28:59,475 --> 00:29:00,475
Right.

321
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,002
If you get hit once,

322
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,444
you hit back twice.

323
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:15,508
Stop acting like a baby.

324
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:16,801
Stop crying.

325
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,141
You hear?

326
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:23,791
I never wanna see you cry.

327
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:27,085
You idiot.

328
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:00,173
Amelia.

329
00:34:52,953 --> 00:34:55,515
Help. Help!

330
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,308
Hey, there's someone in there.

331
00:34:57,332 --> 00:34:58,893
What's the matter?
- Help me.

332
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,353
I'm locked in and someone,

333
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:02,921
someone is following me.

334
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:06,258
Don't worry, I'll climb over.

335
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:08,844
Hurry, hurry.

336
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,448
It's too high, lady.

337
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:14,075
I'll go over to the main gate.

338
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,035
No, please don't leave me.

339
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:17,495
Someone is after me.

340
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,789
They're going to kill me.

341
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:21,666
- Nothing is gonna happen.
- Yes, it will!

342
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,334
Oh, please!

343
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,879
Oh my God, no!

344
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:34,262
- Hi, Roberto.
- Hi, Dalia.

345
00:35:34,286 --> 00:35:35,222
How come-
- My little cousin

346
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,806
is taking a vacation.

347
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,851
She's going to be staying
with us for a while.

348
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:43,104
Look, if I'm a nuisance, I'll go.

349
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:44,004
Don't be stupid.

350
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:45,606
I'm delighted.

351
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,442
Dalia, come and listen to this story

352
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:50,278
It's called "The Rape of Frankenstein" or

353
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:52,137
Or "The Man Made Molested."

354
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:54,157
Why right now?

355
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,307
How come Dalia is here?

356
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,517
She just showed up.

357
00:35:58,143 --> 00:35:59,721
You know how she is.

358
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:02,498
Would you rather I send her home?

359
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:03,522
Yes.

360
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:09,389
No, it's okay.

361
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:11,299
Just as soon the others went home.

362
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,925
Keep dropping in without warning.

363
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:15,219
What's more, the maid's disappeared.

364
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:17,480
I haven't seen her since this morning.

365
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:20,825
This Austrian psychiatrist
is giving the baron a low down

366
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,945
on why his monster's so bloodthirsty.

367
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:25,822
It's cause he's got no sex life.

368
00:36:25,846 --> 00:36:27,240
Libido frustration.

369
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,576
Consequent homicidal impulse.

370
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,077
The baron figured this head shrinker

371
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,745
knows what he's talking about,

372
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:33,979
so back to the lab.

373
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:38,793
This time his monster's
gonna have, uh, sex appeal.

374
00:36:39,652 --> 00:36:42,046
Unfortunately the baron overdoes it,

375
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,032
and the first thing the monster
does is try to rape him.

376
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,011
The baron escapes in the nick of time,

377
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:50,305
but he is bugged by the thought that

378
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:51,848
maybe his monster is queer.

379
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:54,434
No way.

380
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,251
Down in the village the word is out.

381
00:36:57,294 --> 00:37:00,023
The Frankenstein monster
will rape anything in sight.

382
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:02,883
The local farmers scour the country side,

383
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:05,153
and so does the local schoolmarm,

384
00:37:05,177 --> 00:37:06,321
not a day over 70,

385
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:09,115
she rip off her bra and
panties and rushes out.

386
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,116
More willing than able

387
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,328
to sacrifice herself
for the sake of science.

388
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:15,622
that's ridiculous.

389
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:16,897
What's with you lately?

390
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Nothing, why?

391
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:20,960
Come on, Roberto.

392
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:22,462
Something's wrong.

393
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:24,780
You didn't even show up
for rehearsal today.

394
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:26,948
I was busy.

395
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:35,731
Hello.

396
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,150
Yes, That's right.

397
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:41,779
No.

398
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:50,913
Yes, I see.

399
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:56,169
Yes, certainly.

400
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:06,930
It was the police.

401
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:10,726
They found the maid with her throat cut.

402
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:17,106
They said

403
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:20,402
it was a maniac.

404
00:38:25,073 --> 00:38:28,911
Tomorrow I've got to go
to the police station.

405
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:19,061
I'm scared.

406
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:23,025
They're out to get us.

407
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,611
And it's not blackmail.

408
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,907
They want to kill us.

409
00:40:34,202 --> 00:40:37,473
I don't know how you
can stand living here,

410
00:40:37,497 --> 00:40:39,100
knowing that there's somebody coming

411
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:40,876
and going to do whatever they want.

412
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:44,838
Spying on you, following you,

413
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:49,342
just waiting to kill you.

414
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:51,553
What can I do?

415
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:56,475
You've got to make up your mind.

416
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:04,282
Either we leave here, or you
tell the police everything.

417
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:08,070
You just remember one thing,

418
00:41:09,863 --> 00:41:10,863
I killed a man.

419
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,743
As frightening as it
sounds, you think about it.

420
00:41:16,036 --> 00:41:17,496
I'll get 15 years.

421
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:20,248
His name was Carlo Marosi.

422
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:23,710
I killed him.

423
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:44,897
Hey.

424
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
Hello?

425
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:19,641
It's me.

426
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,560
See you at my place, huh?

427
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:26,190
Yeah, well, I think you will be there.

428
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,919
I'm pretty fed up with things, see.

429
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:31,737
I read the newspapers too, you know.

430
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:37,844
This time someone really
got killed, right?

431
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:53,735
I wanted a son,
not a weakling like you.

432
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:55,612
What have you done now?

433
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:58,198
You'll end up in an asylum.

434
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:00,349
Asylum!

435
00:43:01,892 --> 00:43:03,495
Did they steal your cat?

436
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:04,996
- Yeah.
- So it's true.

437
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,956
Last night I saw someone
run across your garden

438
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,750
with a cat wrapped in blanket.

439
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:10,377
A black figure.

440
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:13,088
Look what I got to remember him by.

441
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:15,739
I tried to stop him and
woke up 15 minutes later.

442
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:23,329
Hmm?

443
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:26,958
Hey.

444
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:28,668
You watch out.

445
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:31,004
This time I'm armed.

446
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:36,676
This way.

447
00:43:42,808 --> 00:43:46,788
Look, the bread we agreed on,

448
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,105
I decided it ain't enough.

449
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:51,650
And here, you can have your toy back.

450
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,866
I've had it, see.

451
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,469
First, I've got to play dead.

452
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:02,762
Okay.

453
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:05,807
Then I got to risk my neck
with this nightly visits.

454
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:09,585
And to top it off, that
disgusting business with the cat.

455
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:12,796
But now, the real killing,

456
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:15,108
that maid.

457
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:16,818
Okay, so she found out.

458
00:44:16,842 --> 00:44:18,719
Did you have to kill her?

459
00:44:18,761 --> 00:44:20,572
We made a deal, sure.

460
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:24,057
Nobody said anything
about murder.

461
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:04,657
No! No!

462
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:48,517
POLICE HQ

463
00:46:34,187 --> 00:46:35,373
Oh.

464
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:36,857
Can I help you?

465
00:46:36,899 --> 00:46:38,001
No.

466
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:39,168
I guess I made a mistake.

467
00:46:39,192 --> 00:46:41,796
I was looking for Arrosio,
private investigator.

468
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,131
No, no, wait.

469
00:46:43,155 --> 00:46:43,966
That's me.

470
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,073
Private investigator.

471
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:46,991
Oh.

472
00:46:49,244 --> 00:46:50,244
You see,

473
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:52,807
well look, never mind.

474
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:53,642
No, no.

475
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:54,642
Don't go.

476
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,666
I'm waiting.

477
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:03,443
But it's a bit risky.

478
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,402
And I don't-

479
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:05,361
Oh, yes.

480
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:06,280
And you're thinking,

481
00:47:06,304 --> 00:47:09,449
this fairy is gonna jump on a
chair and scream bloody murder

482
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:10,473
if he sees a mouse.

483
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:12,535
Huh, right?

484
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,245
Yes, that's what I thought.

485
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:17,272
Oh, you heterosexuals.

486
00:47:18,732 --> 00:47:21,818
I don't suppose you've ever
had a homosexual experience?

487
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:23,880
Let's forget it, man.

488
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:24,715
Yes.

489
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:25,882
We're men, too, you know?

490
00:47:25,906 --> 00:47:27,282
Just a little different.

491
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:30,118
- That's very comforting.
- Mm-hmm.

492
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:39,878
Mmm.

493
00:47:41,296 --> 00:47:42,106
Who's paying?

494
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,130
You?

495
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:44,924
Huh?

496
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:50,137
What's he had?

497
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:54,518
A steak, three sandwiches,
two eggs and a bottle of beer.

498
00:47:59,648 --> 00:48:00,941
Guess he wasn't hungry.

499
00:48:03,235 --> 00:48:04,235
Thank you.

500
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:09,300
I'm not sure I believe you.

501
00:48:09,324 --> 00:48:10,927
Your story is awfully shallow.

502
00:48:10,951 --> 00:48:12,953
I can't think of a better one.

503
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:16,391
You know, this case is a real challenge.

504
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:19,435
Fortunately, the odds are in our favor.

505
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,229
- The odds?
- Exactly.

506
00:48:21,253 --> 00:48:23,314
You see before you a fully fledged

507
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:26,067
highly qualified private investigator

508
00:48:26,091 --> 00:48:29,362
with an extensive
knowledge of modern science

509
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:31,096
at his very fingertips.

510
00:48:31,972 --> 00:48:33,533
And in spite of this,

511
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:37,245
in three years of honest practice,

512
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,789
I haven't solved a single case.

513
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:40,814
Not even one?

514
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:42,648
Not even one.

515
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,901
Interesting, isn't it?

516
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:48,297
I suppose so, but it might mean-

517
00:48:48,321 --> 00:48:49,882
It means this.

518
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:51,342
Statistically speaking,

519
00:48:51,366 --> 00:48:54,846
one of the most impressive
records of failure

520
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,496
is destined to be broken.

521
00:48:57,998 --> 00:48:59,332
84 failures

522
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,061
A fantastic record.

523
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:03,085
Incredible.

524
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:06,757
A record like that couldn't possibly last.

525
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,819
I could just sit in my office and wait

526
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:11,386
for the criminal to show up.

527
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:13,364
Please, don't do that.

528
00:49:13,388 --> 00:49:14,388
Oh, no.

529
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:19,078
I'll take a very personal interest

530
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:20,102
in your case.

531
00:49:23,106 --> 00:49:24,375
What do you want?

532
00:49:24,399 --> 00:49:26,026
Please, inform the mailman

533
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:28,487
not to leave any more of
this filth at my house!

534
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,617
Had any trouble with your wife?

535
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:38,038
Other women, maybe?

536
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,016
No.

537
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,183
Oh.

538
00:49:40,207 --> 00:49:41,833
Any money in your family?

539
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:44,377
No, nothing.

540
00:49:45,796 --> 00:49:47,130
Your wife, maybe?

541
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:55,615
Well, she was left a
fairly large inheritance.

542
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:56,639
Oh, haha.

543
00:49:57,432 --> 00:49:58,701
What do you mean "Oh, haha"?

544
00:49:58,725 --> 00:49:59,535
Oh, nothing.

545
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:00,559
Just "Oh".

546
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:04,665
Look, you don't think...

547
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:05,750
What have you written there?

548
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:07,943
Nothing, just notes.

549
00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:13,490
Okay, let me off here.

550
00:50:15,158 --> 00:50:17,702
You won't realize I'm around.

551
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,581
I'll contact you by phone.

552
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:40,076
Looks like trouble.

553
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,036
They've been in there half an hour.

554
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,060
Beat it.

555
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:46,666
"Get thee out of thy country."

556
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,690
Genesis, 12:1.

557
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:08,837
Commissioner, leave me with my husband?

558
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:11,882
I'm going with them.

559
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:15,760
It's about the maid.

560
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,973
They showed me pictures of the body.

561
00:51:23,143 --> 00:51:24,704
It's horrible.

562
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:27,397
- Mrs. Tobias.
- It's all right, I'm coming.

563
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:31,460
Listen, you can stay here if you want,

564
00:51:31,484 --> 00:51:33,421
but I can't take it anymore.

565
00:51:33,445 --> 00:51:35,515
I'm not coming back to this house.

566
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:36,948
I've got to get away.

567
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:41,095
I've made a decision, too.

568
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,580
Sticking this out is better
than going to prison,

569
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,041
so I'm gonna stay here.

570
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:49,437
But you're right.

571
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:50,980
It's better for you to go.

572
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:52,881
Visit your relatives for a while

573
00:51:54,007 --> 00:51:55,884
but give me a call now and again, huh?

574
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,782
Whatcha standing there
for, huh? Oh, no. I quit.

575
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:29,042
I'm leaving tonight.

576
00:52:31,628 --> 00:52:33,898
Why didn't you go with Nina?

577
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:35,566
None of your business.

578
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,591
Don't get excited

579
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:40,595
It will all work out, you'll see.

580
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,908
All what?

581
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:46,369
Nina told me the whole story.

582
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:47,787
The blackmail.

583
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:48,811
Everything.

584
00:52:52,148 --> 00:52:55,461
Don't worry, you know you can trust me.

585
00:52:55,485 --> 00:52:56,485
Sure.

586
00:52:57,404 --> 00:53:00,925
Besides, Nina was so upset,
she needed someone to talk to.

587
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:03,427
Okay, so, now you know everything.

588
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:04,470
Have any bright ideas?

589
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:06,913
Yes, first thing is a nice hot bath,

590
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:09,350
to relax you.

591
00:53:09,374 --> 00:53:10,792
Then you can think about it.

592
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:13,521
Don't miss your train, Dalia.

593
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:14,356
Oh, come on.

594
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,773
I've got some relaxing bath salts.

595
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:17,299
I don't want a bath.

596
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:34,458
My God!

597
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:35,482
Roberto.

598
00:53:40,572 --> 00:53:41,572
You idiot.

599
00:53:42,657 --> 00:53:44,075
You really gave me a fright.

600
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:49,456
I'm soaked through.

601
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,601
Come on.

602
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,251
Sit up, and I'll massage your back.

603
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:07,098
That better?

604
00:54:15,273 --> 00:54:16,667
Hey!

605
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:17,626
None of that now.

606
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,650
You hear?

607
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:08,201
No, stop it, please.

608
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,597
It's out of the question.

609
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:12,622
You know it.

610
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,540
No.

611
00:55:55,498 --> 00:55:59,311
You know, besides being cousins,

612
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:01,004
Nina and I are very good friends,

613
00:56:02,672 --> 00:56:04,674
but I'm not sorry we're making love.

614
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:08,720
Kinda sick, don't you think?

615
00:56:21,774 --> 00:56:23,002
Hi.

616
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:24,026
Oh.

617
00:56:24,936 --> 00:56:26,739
I need more evidence.

618
00:56:26,863 --> 00:56:30,810
Like letters, things sent
by the the blackmailer.

619
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:34,680
Photos of you, your
family, friends, addresses,

620
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:36,140
anything you can find.

621
00:56:36,164 --> 00:56:37,183
Everything is right here.

622
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:38,207
Oh.

623
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,728
About 100 photos.

624
00:56:40,752 --> 00:56:42,253
The whole works.
- Thank you.

625
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:45,465
Oh, the missus, I suppose.

626
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:46,984
No, she's a friend,

627
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:48,527
I mean a relative.

628
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:50,821
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

629
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:51,864
Wait a minute.

630
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:52,889
I've got the wallet.

631
00:56:54,098 --> 00:56:55,141
Right over here.

632
00:57:43,657 --> 00:57:44,657
What was it?

633
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:48,078
Nothing, just a nightmare.

634
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:50,831
You missed your train.

635
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:54,918
I have an idea it's not
the only one I'll miss.

636
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:14,271
No, it's impossible.

637
00:58:20,694 --> 00:58:22,696
<i>PERSONALITY OF THE PERPETRATOR</i>

638
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,157

642
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:37,501
No, no, no.

643
00:59:12,037 --> 00:59:14,265
- Hello?
- It's me, Arrosio.

644
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,768
No real news, but I was
studying the photographs

645
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:19,771
and I've noticed a strange
physical resemblance.

646
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:20,772
Between who?

647
00:59:20,796 --> 00:59:22,982
Well, it may be a red herring.

648
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:24,567
I'll tell you another time.

649
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:25,402
Oh, by the way,

650
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:27,320
I wanted to let you know
you may not hear from me

651
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:28,446
for a few days.

652
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,764
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, hold it a minute.

653
00:59:31,765 --> 00:59:32,618
Sorry.

654
00:59:32,642 --> 00:59:34,077
Does this name ring a bell?

655
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:35,787
Villa Rapidi.

656
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:38,081
No, never heard the name before?

657
00:59:38,105 --> 00:59:39,523
- Okay, bye.
- Why?

658
00:59:49,866 --> 00:59:52,303
Yes, it was a form of paranoia.

659
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:53,721
In its early stages,

660
00:59:53,745 --> 00:59:55,807
it was characterized by violent outbursts.

661
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:57,809
I would definitely described it

662
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,353
as an extreme case of homicidal mania.

663
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,563
The patient was here for three years.

664
01:00:02,587 --> 01:00:05,900
After the father died, all symptoms

665
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:08,152
of emotional disturbance disappeared.

666
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:12,240
It was our opinion that the
patient was completely cured.

667
01:00:12,264 --> 01:00:14,492
However, there is one important point

668
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:15,827
I would like to emphasize.

669
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:18,937
We suspected that the man was
not the patient's real father.

670
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:21,666
Oh.

671
01:01:40,602 --> 01:01:42,354
Roberto, telephone.

672
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:49,318
It's Nina.

673
01:01:50,362 --> 01:01:51,964
Hi, honey.

674
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:52,988
Okay.

675
01:01:54,115 --> 01:01:55,115
No, no news.

676
01:01:57,994 --> 01:01:59,496
No, I'm not leaving.

677
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,128
I've already told you.

678
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:46,495
Hello.

679
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:48,807
Looking for something?

680
01:03:48,831 --> 01:03:50,059
Oh, hello.

681
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:52,144
I was looking for you.

682
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:53,270
Me?

683
01:03:53,294 --> 01:03:54,294
Yes.

684
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:07,785
I immediately thought

685
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:09,787
I need to rent the place to carry on

686
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:12,498
but nobody else ever comes.

687
01:04:12,522 --> 01:04:13,499
- No.
- Really.

688
01:04:13,523 --> 01:04:14,334
Is that so?

689
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:15,626
I'd hardly tell you a lie.

690
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:16,461
Oh, no.

691
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:17,586
I believe you.

692
01:04:19,237 --> 01:04:20,173
Hold on.

693
01:04:20,197 --> 01:04:21,239
Our friend's leaving.

694
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:23,717
Thanks for everything.

695
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:24,551
Bye.

696
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,575
Don't mention it.

697
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:28,305
Telephone me sometime?

698
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:29,390
Okay.

699
01:04:29,414 --> 01:04:30,414
Bye.

700
01:05:27,764 --> 01:05:28,575
Excuse me.

701
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:29,658
Sorry.

702
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:30,682
Excuse me.

703
01:06:46,592 --> 01:06:49,530
Pardon me, sorry, excuse me.

704
01:06:49,554 --> 01:06:51,264
Excuse me, thank you.

705
01:08:49,507 --> 01:08:51,360
Congratulations.

706
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:52,927
You guessed right.

707
01:09:35,428 --> 01:09:36,596
I was right.

708
01:09:39,348 --> 01:09:40,933
I did it this time.

709
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,334
And I've actually established

710
01:09:49,358 --> 01:09:51,587
that in 4000 years of civilization,

711
01:09:51,611 --> 01:09:54,214
there have been only
had 230 years of peace.

712
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,091
Incredible, isn't it?

713
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:57,134
Look, Andrea.

714
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:58,969
I'm just not in the mood.

715
01:09:58,993 --> 01:10:01,096
What did you want to see me about?

716
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,431
Mmm.

717
01:10:02,455 --> 01:10:03,682
Nina telephoned me.

718
01:10:03,706 --> 01:10:06,000
She pleaded with me to
convince you to join her.

719
01:10:07,585 --> 01:10:08,645
I see.

720
01:10:08,669 --> 01:10:09,646
Thanks.

721
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,839
Hold on and listen
for a minute, will you?

722
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:20,282
I don't know why, but she's
terribly worried about you.

723
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:21,742
Why don't you do what she says?

724
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:22,766
Hmm?

725
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,162
Is there another woman?

726
01:10:25,186 --> 01:10:26,479
No, not exactly.

727
01:10:27,813 --> 01:10:29,875
You want your marriage to break up?

728
01:10:29,899 --> 01:10:31,668
You wanna see Nina to end up like Maria?

729
01:10:31,692 --> 01:10:33,295
What does that mean?

730
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:34,463
Well, she
wouldn't want me to tell you,

731
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:36,840
but the fact is, Maria
is in love with you.

732
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:39,468
Has been for years.

733
01:10:39,492 --> 01:10:41,470
She never got married, never
bothered with other men.

734
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:43,764
She waits, in silent adoration

735
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:44,724
like a little dog.

736
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:46,749

note the beautifully finished interior.

740
01:11:46,809 --> 01:11:49,121
None of that cheap old-fashioned satin.

741
01:11:49,145 --> 01:11:50,288
No, siree.

742
01:11:50,312 --> 01:11:51,623
Nothing but the best.

743
01:11:51,647 --> 01:11:53,542

01:11:57,278 --> 01:11:59,381
God forbidding, who should pass away

746
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:01,425
during the period of the exhibition,

747
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:05,429
we have a discount of 25%.

748
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:07,329
Make it 50 and we got a deal.

749
01:12:17,757 --> 01:12:19,341
Some place you picked to meet.

750
01:12:21,594 --> 01:12:22,970
I did it deliberately

751
01:12:25,222 --> 01:12:28,577
Seeing all these worms
make a living out of death.

752
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:30,770
It kinda knocks the
fear out of you, right?

753
01:12:32,563 --> 01:12:33,374
Let's face it,

754
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:34,690
everyone has to die.

755
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:37,401
That's the commercial necessity.

756
01:12:40,362 --> 01:12:41,257
Excuse me.

757
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:42,323
Could I have a light?

758
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:46,075
Thank you.

759
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,875
And if that's not enough,

760
01:12:53,918 --> 01:12:56,295
I keep having this dream
about an execution.

761
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:00,984
The strange thing is during the dream,

762
01:13:01,008 --> 01:13:03,010
it's as if I were living it.

763
01:13:04,929 --> 01:13:05,930
Very kind.

764
01:13:07,139 --> 01:13:08,742
Like maybe its a premonition.

765
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:10,202
Or an omen.

766
01:13:10,226 --> 01:13:11,411
Can that sort of thing happen

767
01:13:11,435 --> 01:13:13,455
or you think I'm crackin' up?

768
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:15,582
"Then was a secret revealed unto Daniel

769
01:13:15,606 --> 01:13:16,625
in a night vision."

770
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:18,919
Daniel 2:19.

771
01:13:18,943 --> 01:13:20,378
Exactly.

772
01:13:20,402 --> 01:13:21,755
Take my advice.

773
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:24,049
Things are really serious,
more serious than we imagined.

774
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:25,217
You should go to the police.

775
01:13:25,241 --> 01:13:26,301
Level with them.

776
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:29,054
Sure, then I'll go to prison
for the rest of my life.

777
01:13:29,078 --> 01:13:31,765
Step right here.

778
01:13:31,789 --> 01:13:33,374
Let's try for size.

779
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:35,583
There.

780
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,271
Is that alright?

781
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:38,897
It's a bit narrow.

782
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:40,649
I feel uncomfortable.

783
01:13:40,673 --> 01:13:43,193
Oh, I can assure you
none of our customers

784
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:45,070
have ever come back with a complaint about

785
01:13:45,094 --> 01:13:46,470
the comfort of our coffin.

786
01:13:49,515 --> 01:13:50,515
It's a bit gaudy.

787
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:59,174
Someone obviously
suffering from paranoia

788
01:13:59,374 --> 01:14:00,584
is playing a game with you.

789
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:03,588
I can't figure out why.

790
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:05,507
I think someone is
trying to drive you crazy

791
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:07,092
before finally killing you.

792
01:14:07,116 --> 01:14:10,411
Another charming idea, but
what about the other murders?

793
01:14:12,496 --> 01:14:15,642
A double coffin for double deaths.

794
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:18,270
Something must have fouled things up.

795
01:14:18,294 --> 01:14:20,021
Someone probably caught on,

796
01:14:20,045 --> 01:14:22,190
realized who was persecuting you,

797
01:14:22,214 --> 01:14:24,150
and that's why they got murdered.

798
01:14:24,174 --> 01:14:25,968
The murderer began to enjoy killing.

799
01:14:27,094 --> 01:14:29,030
He probably thrives on the blood,

800
01:14:29,054 --> 01:14:31,283
the torture of a human being.

801
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:33,994
The killer is a homicidal paranoid.

802
01:14:34,018 --> 01:14:36,538
Cases like that commit
the most horrendous crimes

803
01:14:36,562 --> 01:14:39,148
for what appear to be most
insignificant reasons.

804
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,399
Mmm.

805
01:14:42,818 --> 01:14:46,047
Why don't you try taking your
wife's advice and clear out

806
01:14:46,071 --> 01:14:47,382
for a while?

807
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:48,406
Where to?

808
01:14:49,658 --> 01:14:51,452
You think that would solve anything?

809
01:14:52,494 --> 01:14:54,914
I don't know, it's worth a try.

810
01:15:10,971 --> 01:15:13,140
You'll end up in an asylum.

811
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:25,527
I wanted a son, not a weakling like you.

812
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:38,099
If you get hit once,

813
01:15:38,123 --> 01:15:39,541
you hit back twice.

814
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:46,422
Hello?

815
01:15:47,883 --> 01:15:50,320
No, not at the moment.

816
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:52,012
No, it's impossible.

817
01:15:53,138 --> 01:15:55,075
Is it important?

818
01:15:55,099 --> 01:15:58,435
Okay, I'll tell him to call you at home.

819
01:16:26,964 --> 01:16:28,066
Hello?

820
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:28,901
Okay, play it back.

821
01:16:38,726 --> 01:16:39,828
A girl phoned before.

822
01:16:39,852 --> 01:16:40,663
Dalia.

823
01:16:40,687 --> 01:16:42,789
She says it's important
you telephone her at home.

824
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:12,887
Mrs. Tobias.

825
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:13,888
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

826
01:23:13,912 --> 01:23:17,392
We intend to carry out series
of tests on the victim.

827
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:18,559
I was wondering if a member

828
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,645
of family would like to be present.

829
01:23:20,669 --> 01:23:22,313
Her parents hardly seem in the condition-

830
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:23,337
Neither am I.

831
01:23:24,339 --> 01:23:25,799
Speak to my husband.

832
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,164
Won't you come this way, please?

833
01:23:40,188 --> 01:23:41,398
What's this all about?

834
01:23:42,232 --> 01:23:46,003
I want to have a test
performed on the girl's eyes.

835
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:47,505
It's been recently discovered

836
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:50,800
that the last image seen
by the victim before death

837
01:23:50,824 --> 01:23:53,243
is retained for several
hours on the retina.

838
01:23:54,202 --> 01:23:56,055
It's a very difficult procedure

839
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:59,642
but it is possible to
photograph this image.

840
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:02,520
Experiments carried out in Germany,

841
01:24:02,544 --> 01:24:04,814
United States, and more recently in Italy

842
01:24:04,838 --> 01:24:07,275
have had surprisingly good results.

843
01:24:07,299 --> 01:24:09,193
In some cases it's even been possible

844
01:24:09,217 --> 01:24:11,654
to distinguish the murderer's face

845
01:24:11,678 --> 01:24:13,781
at the very moment he committed the crime.

846
01:24:39,915 --> 01:24:40,915
What are they?

847
01:24:42,209 --> 01:24:44,061
They look like flies.

848
01:24:44,085 --> 01:24:45,128
Four flies.

849
01:24:46,505 --> 01:24:48,274
Yes, you're right.

850
01:24:48,298 --> 01:24:50,592
That's exactly what they look like.

851
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:53,511
What does it mean?

852
01:25:39,558 --> 01:25:44,354
Yeah, that's one solution,
but don't leave the house.

853
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:47,583
You choose your own territory,

854
01:25:47,607 --> 01:25:49,526
lock yourself in and hold out.

855
01:25:51,194 --> 01:25:53,464
Sooner or later, he'll show up,

856
01:25:53,488 --> 01:25:55,073
and you'll be ready and waiting.

857
01:25:56,199 --> 01:25:57,993
But it's gonna take a lotta guts.

858
01:25:59,327 --> 01:26:00,327
You got guts?

859
01:26:02,747 --> 01:26:03,957
I guess I'll find out.

860
01:26:06,668 --> 01:26:07,668
Okay.

861
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,671
I'll keep in touch.

862
01:28:09,466 --> 01:28:10,634
- Hello?
- Yeah.

863
01:28:11,718 --> 01:28:12,718
How's it going?

864
01:28:14,304 --> 01:28:15,547
So far, so good.

865
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:18,201
Nothing's happened.

866
01:28:18,225 --> 01:28:19,702
Do you want me to come over?

867
01:28:19,726 --> 01:28:21,662
It might be easier if-

868
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:22,686
God?

869
01:28:24,105 --> 01:28:25,105
Hello?

870
01:31:50,186 --> 01:31:51,186
Nina.

871
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:55,899
Roberto.

872
01:31:57,569 --> 01:31:59,154
What are you doing?

873
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:05,076
You scared me with that gun.

874
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,890
What are you doing here in the dark?

875
01:32:20,967 --> 01:32:23,970
For a second I thought...

876
01:32:29,267 --> 01:32:31,519
God, Nina, you showed
up at the right moment.

877
01:32:34,564 --> 01:32:35,708
What's the matter?

878
01:32:35,732 --> 01:32:36,542
Why didn't-

879
01:32:36,566 --> 01:32:37,376
Quick, you got to get out of here.

880
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,211
Now, right away.

881
01:32:38,235 --> 01:32:39,837
Listen, I decided that I was wrong.

882
01:32:39,861 --> 01:32:40,921
Somebody has to stay here with you.

883
01:32:40,945 --> 01:32:42,423
But not now.

884
01:32:42,447 --> 01:32:43,591
Look, I can't explain.

885
01:32:43,615 --> 01:32:44,426
There's no time

886
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:46,177
You got to get out of here, understand?

887
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:47,094
In the morning, Nina,

888
01:32:47,118 --> 01:32:48,053
come back in the morning!

889
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:48,888
What's the matter?

890
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:49,722
What's happening?

891
01:32:49,746 --> 01:32:50,556
Look.

892
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,391
I'm waiting for someone.

893
01:32:51,415 --> 01:32:52,892
Now you go out that door and you run,

894
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:53,727
you run to my car.

895
01:32:53,751 --> 01:32:54,894
It's parked at front.

896
01:32:54,918 --> 01:32:55,960
Now here's the keys.

897
01:32:57,003 --> 01:32:57,939
Now listen.

898
01:32:57,963 --> 01:32:59,064
You got in that car and you drive.

899
01:32:59,088 --> 01:32:59,899
I don't care where.

900
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:00,734
You just drive.

901
01:33:00,758 --> 01:33:02,151
Just go, okay?

902
01:33:02,175 --> 01:33:03,235
Now go.

903
01:33:03,259 --> 01:33:04,259
Go, I say!

904
01:33:11,142 --> 01:33:12,602
They look like flies.

905
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:39,729
I'm a goddamn fool.

906
01:33:44,884 --> 01:33:46,803
I sure didn't have to look far, did I?

907
01:33:53,643 --> 01:33:54,954
What are you doing?

908
01:33:54,978 --> 01:33:56,020
You're crazy.

909
01:34:04,445 --> 01:34:06,006
You killed Dalia.

910
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:08,217
That's what she saw.

911
01:34:08,241 --> 01:34:09,760
You did it.

912
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:11,178
You did it all!

913
01:34:11,202 --> 01:34:12,013
You did-

914
01:34:13,913 --> 01:34:15,164
Take your hands off me.

915
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:28,052
Get over there.

916
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:43,985
All of a sudden, you're so clever.

917
01:34:45,153 --> 01:34:46,946
Who'd have expected it?

918
01:34:56,623 --> 01:34:57,623
Watch it.

919
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:01,044
I want you there.

920
01:35:16,267 --> 01:35:20,521
I want so badly see you die slowly,

921
01:35:22,523 --> 01:35:23,523
painfully.

922
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:25,920
Back.

923
01:35:25,944 --> 01:35:26,944
Back!

924
01:35:32,784 --> 01:35:33,784
Why?

925
01:35:37,121 --> 01:35:38,121
Why?

926
01:35:39,624 --> 01:35:41,998
Because you're so much
like him.

927
01:35:54,555 --> 01:35:56,357
First shot got your arm.

928
01:35:57,967 --> 01:35:59,267
It hurts.

929
01:36:00,979 --> 01:36:02,288
I know what it's like.

930
01:36:04,816 --> 01:36:06,142
I've suffered, too.

931
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:10,154
My pig father!

932
01:36:12,323 --> 01:36:13,825
He made me suffer.

933
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:21,124
Did you know?

934
01:36:24,127 --> 01:36:26,295
He brought me up as a boy.

935
01:36:29,757 --> 01:36:32,927
He felt cheated because he'd had a girl.

936
01:36:38,016 --> 01:36:40,101
He dressed me like a boy.

937
01:36:46,024 --> 01:36:47,275
And he beat me.

938
01:36:48,443 --> 01:36:49,443
He beat me!

939
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:59,162
He did all kinds
of things to me,

940
01:37:00,663 --> 01:37:02,874
for years and years.

941
01:37:10,683 --> 01:37:12,518
But I disappointed him.

942
01:37:15,437 --> 01:37:17,606
Because I never reacted
like a man would.

943
01:37:22,361 --> 01:37:23,612
He said I was crazy.

944
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:28,367
And my mother,

945
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,348
she died in an asylum.

946
01:37:39,345 --> 01:37:41,013
He put me there too.

947
01:37:43,349 --> 01:37:45,002
Three long years.

948
01:37:57,613 --> 01:37:59,273
Do you know what
the doctors said?

949
01:38:04,153 --> 01:38:05,537
They said I was deranged!

950
01:38:07,239 --> 01:38:08,382
A miserable lunatic.

951
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:10,743
A maniac.

952
01:38:14,371 --> 01:38:16,248
How could they know

953
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:20,928
about what I had suffered?

954
01:38:24,923 --> 01:38:26,717
I didn't have time to get my...

955
01:38:29,845 --> 01:38:32,297
To get my revenge, because
he died on his own!

956
01:38:35,726 --> 01:38:39,480
He died before I could get him,

957
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:43,201
before I could kill him.

958
01:38:46,862 --> 01:38:51,909
I had to find someone else
who could pay in his place.

959
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,074
Pay for everything
he had done to me.

960
01:39:01,085 --> 01:39:02,486
I had to get my revenge!

961
01:39:04,863 --> 01:39:07,057
And I found that someone!

962
01:39:11,687 --> 01:39:13,138
When I met you.

963
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,501
I couldn't believe it.

964
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,460
It was like a miracle.

965
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,799
You look just like him.

966
01:39:25,217 --> 01:39:26,778
I knew I'd kill you!

967
01:39:29,597 --> 01:39:30,597
Stop!

968
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:43,546
I came here as quickly as I could.

969
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:45,838
She's crazy.

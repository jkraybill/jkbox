How did you become crippled?

193
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,237
Little devil!

194
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,107
Father...

195
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,174
My eyes.

196
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,040
My ears...

197
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:48,224
I must teach you.

198
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,038
Kick all kung fu schools in town.

199
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:02,111
Chang Tien-hsiang, you can't hide!

200
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,086
Who's the boss, come out!

201
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,050
From where are you?

202
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,187
Very boastful.

203
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:21,188
What's the matter, find me.

204
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,097
I'll frighten you to death.

205
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,006
What's the matter?

206
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,140
Teacher...they came for you

207
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,051
I'll tackle.

208
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,247
Teacher, your chap is here.

209
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,192
Tear off!

210
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,162
The boss has come.

211
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,223
Deaf and blind join forces.

212
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,038
One is deaf, the other's blind!

213
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,162
It's easy work.

214
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,058
No good boxer in whole school!

215
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,229
There's still me.

216
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,226
Half-filled tub!

217
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,992
I'll fix him up.

218
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,208
Deaf fellow, looks a tiger.

219
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,151
It's 250 after all.

220
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,186
Get away.

221
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:23,282
Get away.

222
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,149
There's no Eagle's Claws.

223
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:31,093
You really have something.

224
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:49,044
Can't tackle two cripples.

225
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,173
Aren't you stupid?

226
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:59,990
You're boasting.

227
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,084
Almost ruined.

228
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:05,063
Cut off your fingers if you dare.

229
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:10,190
You couldn't be beaten like this.

230
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,079
Look.

231
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,076
Old chap, be faster.

232
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,207
The fast worker survives.

233
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:34,151
The slow one will starve.

234
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,087
Make the deaf fellow blind.

235
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:45,062
Also make the blind fellow deaf.

236
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,198
You talk big only.

237
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:53,227
It's useless talking to you.

238
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:55,069
Wait.

239
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:01,203
Let us have a nice talk.

240
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,179
Don't be so hot-tempered

241
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,048
I have nearly died.

242
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,212
Why I came to such a school!

243
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:22,122
Whole school can't beat two cripples.

244
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,032
Isn't it disgusting.

245
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:56,048
When did he become so cute?

246
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,054
Talking about me?

247
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:01,215
Clear off.

248
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,258
Teacher, drink tea.
- What are you doing?

249
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,125
Drink tea, please.
- Drinking tea?

250
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,272
Any pepper powder?

251
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,075
No, special spice.

252
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,165
Spice!

253
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,243
Teacher, sit down.

254
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,085
Sit down.

255
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,113
Teacher, cigarette.

256
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,122
It looks evil.

257
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:45,033
Uncle is experienced
I won't be fooled by you.

258
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,230
I'm sincere.

259
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,004
Teacher, accept me as pupil.

260
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,022
You better prepare rice.

261
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,231
Help mending the pan.

262
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,202
Asking me to do heavy work.

263
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,269
It's trifle only.

264
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:33,083
Sorry, not my business.

265
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,185
Why's the pan leaking.

266
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:49,998
You better suffer slowly.

267
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,127
This is a gloomy place....!

268
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:56,163
Just promise to teach me kung fu.

269
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,140
I won't teach, then what?

270
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,008
What can you do to me.

271
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:05,014
Let me out quickly.
- No teaching, is it so?

272
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,207
Let me free soon.

273
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:14,217
What?

274
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,059
it's urine.

275
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:24,190
Let me out, I'll teach....

276
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,167
Is it really?

277
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,002
It's really.

278
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,164
Gentleman's words are binding.

279
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,002
Certainly....!

280
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,135
Teach you....!

281
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:37,240
Teacher.

282
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,179
Teacher, are you alright?
- Sure.

283
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,056
When I'll learn kung fu?

284
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,220
We're only cooks.

285
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,223
You're only talking?

286
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,259
You want to learn kung fu?

287
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,133
Lift.

288
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,006
Heave.

289
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:03,071
Chop.

290
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,142
Fry.

291
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:11,240
knead, then you'll be fine.

292
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,276
Old man, again you pester me.

293
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,255
I'll tell you a story

294
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:23,158
A young cowboy used his hands

295
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:28,062
After 20 years, a cow escaped

296
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:33,169
He killed the cow by slapping!

297
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,002
How terrible are his palms

298
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,270
You think I'm a child.

299
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,036
You're ignorant

300
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:47,106
I've been playing this spade 30 years.

301
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:48,279
Just watch.

302
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,253
You just practice
if you want to achieve it.

303
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,027
Would be very boring.

304
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,022
You think it's not exciting enough!

305
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,123
Show you something exciting.

306
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,201
What excitement?

307
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,132
Stand firmly.

308
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,199
Teacher, be careful.

309
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,138
You get off.

310
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,179
Go that way.

311
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:52,275
Go.

312
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,018
That direction.

313
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,020
Alright.

314
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,021
Run, quickly.

315
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:05,085
Run that way, run...

316
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,256
Good, good.

317
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,063
Take rest.

318
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,141
Such lifting, will maim you!

319
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,243
The you'll suffer long.

320
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,186
Teacher, don't you have a wife?

321
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:38,222
No, I have not.

322
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:43,029
Why didn't you marry?

323
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:48,136
Who loves an old man?

324
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,066
We're bachelors.

325
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,201
Have you feeled with women?

326
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,211
You are childish!

327
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,110
You must have!

328
00:41:57,148 --> 00:42:00,208
Before yes, but not now.

329
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,041
Really?

330
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,112
Teacher when is your birthday?

331
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,056
May 15th.

332
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,024
May 15th?

333
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,200
You're 30 years my senior!

334
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,092
Your birthday will come soon.

335
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,295
Why you ask this?

336
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,128
You'll know them.

337
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,208
I'll go pack off.

338
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:35,212
I want real stuffs

339
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:39,017
It's raining, purchase stuffs quickly.

340
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:39,215
Three dollars.

341
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,993
No, it's five dollars.

342
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,029
How did you give $3?

343
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,291
Yesterday, you said $3.

344
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,225
You want to rob?

345
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,028
I only have $3.

346
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:50,294
Stand firmy.

347
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:54,104
Who's robbing? Come back.

348
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,269
Teacher, today is May 15, your birthday.

349
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:03,003
Today's dishes are poor.

350
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,183
The dishes will be spoiled by wind!

351
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,014
Only such dishes could be bought.

352
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:11,986
I don't know any wind.

353
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:15,215
You've slept the whole day.

354
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:23,029
I hope the storm arrive now.

355
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,104
Dare you cheat me.

356
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,013
Give us rotten food.

357
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:44,111
Light punishment for first offence.

358
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,190
Next time I'll be severe.

359
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,158
Put it here.

360
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:53,163
Let the joss-sticks burn out.

361
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,064
Then you can come down.

362
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,177
Somebody will have bad luck!

363
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:46,080
Again you want to outwit me.

364
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:09,071
He gives me little

365
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,146
Want to be Iasy!

366
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,022
Quick.

367
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,224
Quick.

368
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,119
The back will be broken.

369
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,130
What's the meaning.

370
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:17,099
Steps are unsteady, back is weak.

371
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,101
U p practice slowly.

372
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,167
Good.

373
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,047
Am I very heavy?

374
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,117
Teacher, I can't do it!

375
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,247
You must do it.

376
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:44,250
I will fall and hurt you too!

377
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,013
Teacher, why shaved off the beard?

378
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:46,019
I've been unlucky recently.

379
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,216
Yesterday I consulted fortune-teller

380
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,288
He asked me to shave off my beard.

381
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:52,184
Did it actually happen?

382
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,027
Don't commit nuisance here!

383
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,192
I'll take Ah Wen to lunch.

384
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,269
You're esteemed persons

385
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,270
Let us congratulate the magistrate.

386
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,205
Don't stand on ceremony, please.

387
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,221
Teacher, I've nothing to eat.

388
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,182
Of course, you can look only.

389
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,023
I do thankless job always.

390
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,064
Young people shouldn't mind this.

391
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,225
There's a foreign friend here.

392
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,202
I'll introduce him....

393
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:35,164
How was it?

394
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,139
Shevchenko.

395
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,202
Going outdoors without pants!

396
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,012
Come...bottoms up.

397
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,149
Come...bottoms up.

398
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,179
He's a Russian boxing champ.

399
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:53,019
He admores our Chinese Kung Fu.

400
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:59,127
I want to confront Chinese Kung Fu.

401
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,160
I think chinese kung fu is for show only.

402
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:09,036
The various strokes could be fun

403
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:13,269
Our Russian kung fu means business

404
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:20,176
Russian kung fu is fast.

405
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,108
Powerful too.

406
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,056
Fists are used.

407
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,031
Hows that?

408
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:43,073
Three percent effort is sufficient.

409
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,210
It's really fantastic.

410
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,120
I haven't made any effort.

411
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:01,989
Sit down.

412
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,220
I'm catching mosquitoes.

413
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:08,293
Don't be afraid.

414
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,207
My heaven.

415
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,122
These strokes are wounderfull.

416
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,094
Four Taels Uproot 1000 Catties.

417
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:42,189
Beat you to unconsciousness

418
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,085
Eagle's Claws.

419
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,156
You're progressing very fast.

420
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,994
I'll teach you more unique boxing.

421
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:19,032
You still have more unique strokes?

422
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,036
Of course.

423
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,196
You came so long ago.

424
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,270
How's that nobody told you.

425
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:26,270
Nobody.

426
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,076
Tomorrow I'll teach you.

427
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,109
Let me be comfortable.

428
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:39,053
Can't enter such place.

429
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,020
Teacher, I haven't taken launch.

430
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:47,053
I've forgotten .

431
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,994
Here's $2.

432
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:50,226
Take it.

433
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:55,162
Don't let mistress know it.

434
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,161
I don't know you.

435
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,190
Good dog stays at home.

436
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:28,266
Do you want to die?

437
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:47,123
Where did you learn kung fu?

438
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,189
Will you talk?

439
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,095
How long can you bear?

440
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,145
I can't bear anymore.

441
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:26,196


442
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,214
Teacher!

443
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,226
Let alone distant lands.

444
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:16,264
You're not safe in your mum's wombl.

445
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,121
It's not confusing.

446
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:52,208
Eagle's Claws? I'll burn you!

447
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,250
Who's your teacher?

448
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,028
You better talk!

449
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:22,105
Neck can't resist knide.

450
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:28,238
Speak, or not?

451
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:54,032
Crawl here.

452
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,233
Crawl.

453
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,014

457
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,033
Go there.

458
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,269
That side.

459
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:12,274
Go over.

460
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,083
You are delighted?

461
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,994
Take it.

462
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,075
Your life is in my hands.

Next time I'll take back.

464
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:44,272
Go!

465
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:01,025
Why you let him go.

466
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,259
Must bait him.

467
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:07,195
Watch him.

468
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,157
You seek trouble.

469
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:20,232
They forced me to talk.
I Never talked. I will present this jade
to you afterwards.

470
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:29,243
Let it be broken

471
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:45,968
He is the son of Chen-Kang
I'll teach him "Eagle's Claws".
For revenging his father.

472
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,257
Is this "Five Plums Stick?"

473
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,006
This will be ridiculed by others

474
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:35,068
Take it over.

475
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,207

476
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,260

01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:17,212
Heavy rain.

479
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:01,027

I have been kind to you.

486
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:48,102
I'll kill this animal.

487
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:56,247
No animal is allowed on the table.

488
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:02,218
Do you need it anymore?

489
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:04,091
No, I don't.

490
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:07,027
Re move it.

491
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,058
Keep calm.

492
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:17,164
I'll help you.

493
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,139
Not so bad.

494
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:29,081
You should have come earlier.

495
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,086
Now I've come.

496
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,215
Please sit down.

497
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,218
Dog is not allowed here.

498
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,285
Son, you go down.

499
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:44,030
Keep order, no confusion.

500
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:47,264
I'm disciplined and educated.

501
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:50,130
Then you're very learned.
- You are flattering me.

502
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,264
Have you read a poem?

503
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:57,068
Such thing is trifling.

504
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,245
Please.

505
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:05,143
Answer me.

506
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,251
Who cares for me in trouble?

507
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:12,026
Then?

508
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,162
Recite from the end.

509
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,096
I can also sing reversely.

510
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:21,068
For whom do I suffer?

511
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:26,132
Admit "I'm a dog!".

512
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,280
Don't laugh.

513
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:42,285
Act! Kill!

514
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:47,028
Get away soon .

515
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,063
Damned him.

516
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,066
Stop fighting.

517
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,163
You're still not running.

518
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:09,140
Sit down.

519
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,123
Young boss, are you alright.

520
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,017
Young boss!

521
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,066
You're pestering the nobleman.

522
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,092
You're too conceited.

523
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,194
The restaurant is smashed.

524
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:55,257
Clean it before leaving.

525
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:04,164
Want us to sweep the floor?

526
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,108
I've been leading an easy life.

527
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,236
Dishes are ready

528
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,241
The buns are coming.

529
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,012
Eat it.

530
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,154
Bosqu

531
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,058
Why not yet start sweeping?

532
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:26,118
Want us to do the sweeping?

533
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,965
Do the sweeping!

534
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,987
I don't need to sweep anymore.

535
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:58,090
Keep the tables and chairs in order.

536
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:16,238
Thank you.

537
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,249
Take it, put it down.

538
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,228
One more there!

539
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:44,036
Go q u ickly.

540
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,016

541
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,001
Son, it's me!

542
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,067
This is "Dog Bites Dog!"

543
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,273
Wait for me!

544
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,010
Bill not paid yet.

545
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:37,126
$14....so much tips!

546
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,095
You all, please.

547
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,294
Son, let us go.

548
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:57,079
Watch this!

549
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:05,246
Alright, yesterday you hit my boss.

550
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:06,282
Now fight!

551
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:10,058
Ahh, you wanna fight, right?

552
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:11,218
You are a damn dog.

553
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:05,167
You wish to be lazy?

554
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:06,139
No!.

555
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:09,006
No? I saw you changing dress.

556
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,202
I want to go outdoors.

557
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:13,077
Before learning kung fu?

558
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,108
Who says I'm lacking in kung fu!

559
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,051
I've learned Eagle's Claws, Five Plums Style...

560
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:20,017
I've defeated others.

561
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:24,059
Don't be happy before being skilled.

562
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,215
I'll spar with you

563
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,187
Teacher, be careful.

564
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:23,018
Teacher, what strokes are these?

565
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:28,180
This is "Shadow Eagle's Claws".

566
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:32,092
What is "Shadow"?

567
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:40,035
Image af animal and imagination

568
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:45,105
Attack foe's strong point.

569
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:50,201
Can attack and retreat.

570
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,012
Very fast.

571
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,150
I taught your father "Shadow Fist"

572
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,221
Was licked by Liaotung Phoenix Eyes Fist.

573
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,192
Ma Fei-jen is skilled Liaotung Phoenix Eyes Fist.

574
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:08,094
His Double Phoenix Basking is terrible.

575
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:13,058
Your father was killed by him.

576
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:18,036
Shadow Eagle's Claws are elusive.

577
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:22,234
To oppose Liaotung Phoenix Eyes.

578
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,288
Heart is the general.

579
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,995
Eyes are pioneers.

580
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,031
Fists are like arrows.

581
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,232
Body is like the bent bow.

582
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:58,145
Be natural in movements.

583
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,111
Strong wrists and powerful fingers.

584
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,014
Fast tough kicks.

585
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:15,993
Stand firmly.

586
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,262
Avoid foe's strong points.

587
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:30,271
Eagle's Claws tactics.

588
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:39,119
Practise Shadow Fist.

589
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:50,265
Shadow Eagle's Claws.

590
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,165
Ah Wen, teacher is going.

591
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,024
Teacher is used to loneliness

592
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:30,195
You may now go outside.

593
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,064
Teacher, nothing for you

594
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,201
I am like your father

595
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,205
Remember how your father died.

596
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,083
Teacher, teacher....

597
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,057
Teacher, teacher....

598
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,109
Boss, you'll go there?

599
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,238
Going back to the village.

600
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:11,305
Why?

601
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:17,176
Misfortune never comes single.

602
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:20,050
I must hurry, it's raining.

603
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:21,122
What has happened?

604
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:25,250
My father's school has been robbed.

605
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:27,050
Robbed by whom?

606
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:31,994
By the blind fellow and the deaf chap!

607
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:37,196
I'll help you to get it back.

608
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:44,102
Higher, still higher.

609
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:46,046
Right, lower still.

610
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,140
I said "higher still".

611
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,185
Right, lower still.

612
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:55,250
Damned Fatty, can't you see!

613
01:19:56,058 --> 01:19:57,025
Yes!

614
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,089
Fatty.

615
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:06,260
Getting rich?

616
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:09,163
Good morning sir.

617
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:13,005
How are you?

618
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:16,268
Ah Wen, how are you?

619
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,274
Lucky in lottery?

620
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:24,281
You're not noble-minded

621
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,156
We're not right to refuse helping him!

622
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:32,250
It's such a world.

623
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,189
Our poor Boss is kicked out

624
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:37,255
It's fair.

625
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:41,227
We work from 9 to 5.

626
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,033
How comfortable.

627
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,173
Or, accompany him to the village.

628
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:49,210
It's fighting without mercy!

629
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:53,013
You talk correctly.

630
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:57,144
Ah Wen, you're clever.

631
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:00,187
I help the boss to get back school.

632
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:05,117
His idea is to rob.

633
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,992
Good, up.

634
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:15,070
My back!

635
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,040
Stork? Left peck, right peck.

636
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:22,140
Peck.

637
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,147
I peck hand, head.

638
01:21:27,149 --> 01:21:28,241
Peck you rself.

639
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,116
Peckuu

640
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,031
Damned blind chap.

641
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:46,033
Peck.... I peck.

642
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:47,157
I peck.

643
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:54,275
Peck

644
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,177
Peck the head.

645
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:11,081
Peck, I peck....

646
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:13,219
Peck your buttocks.

647
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:29,034
Our new boss isn't here!

648
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,009
Where's he?

649
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:31,237
He's in the teashop.

650
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,135
What has happened?

651
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:57,229
Haven't seen you a long time!

652
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,004
Not so!

653
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:05,203
Not here, it's there!

654
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:44,084
Deaf joining hands with blind.
Your Cock's Claws are weak.

655
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:47,178
You're teacher can't instruct you.
Finish him off, right

656
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,240
These Cock's Claws are tasteful.

657
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:50,107
Joining hands....?

658
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,192
Are you mad? Not these strokes.

659
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,092
Not me.

660
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,164
Deaf joining hands with blind.

661
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,013
My eyes.

662
01:26:04,126 --> 01:26:06,060
My ears.

663
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:09,223
My eyes

664
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:11,095
My ears.

665
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:47,066
Ma Fei-jen.

666
01:27:22,137 --> 01:27:24,162
I've said before.

667
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,167
I would kill you next time.

668
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,197
Is this stick too small?

669
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,240
It is big enough?

670
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,052
The longer, the better.

671
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,088
Shorter is more terrible.

672
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:02,068
Older is gentler.

673
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:06,232
Left, right, front, back.

674
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:24,181
Left, right, up, down, foot, head

675
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:31,256
This is "Red" and "Green".

676
01:29:50,085 --> 01:29:51,074
Five Plums Stick!

677
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:32,283
Attack heart and lungs.

678
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:34,286
How, not sufficient strength?

679
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:35,997
We suffer.

680
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:04,143
Shadow Eagle's Claws to fight Liaotung Phoenix Eyes.

681
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:06,987
Taste my Liaotung Phoenix Eyes.

682
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:15,152
Heart is "General", eyes are "Pioneers", fist are "Guard"

683
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:05,137
Steps a re steady.

684
01:33:29,137 --> 01:33:30,229

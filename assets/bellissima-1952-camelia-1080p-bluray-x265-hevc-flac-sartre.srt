1
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,300
GORGEOUS

2
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,660
Attention, please!

3
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,500
We have a special message
for all our dear, faithful listeners!

4
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,100
Fathers, mothers, relatives!

5
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,020
Stella Film has organized
a great contest

6
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,580
to find a little girl,
a child from 6 to 8 years of age,

7
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,780
a pretty little Italian girl.

8
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,620
Bring your daughter to Stella Film,

9
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
to Cinecittà offices,
Via Tuscolana, km 9.

10
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,740
It could turn your luck
and hers around!

11
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
All the girls from 6 to 8 years,

12
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,500
can enter the theatre,
quietly and calmly

13
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,620
to be seen by
the film director Blasetti!

14
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,700
Now, go along inside!

15
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,820
Hurry! Hurry! Move along there!

16
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,860
Vito!

17
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,060
Where is this little girl?

18
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,220
- What's her name?
- Maria Cecconi.

19
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,900
Maria Cecconi!

20
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,700
Quiet, please! Quiet!

21
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,900
There! Good manners will get you far.

22
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,180
You will get your daughters
tested by us,

23
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,300
as you'd like, quietly and calmly.

24
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,060
We'll be able to see them better.
Right? Fine!

25
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
- Ready?
- Ready!

26
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,780
Glori, send over the first child.

27
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,540
Let's see the first child. Come on!

28
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,500
What can you do?

29
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,180
I can do an imitation
of Betty Grable.

30
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Good! Go on!

31
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,300
Very good!

32
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Well done! You're starting early,
how old are you?

33
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,500
- Eleven.
- Eleven! Give her a number.

34
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
Next!
Another child, hurry!

35
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,580
Be quiet over there!

36
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,140
Fine... Keep that child quiet!

37
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
- What can you do?
- "Arrivano I nostri".

38
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,780
Perfect!
Sing "Arrivano I nostri". Go!

39
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,060
Fine!

40
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
- Very good!
- Her voice is a little low!

41
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,620
- We need a louder voice.
- Louder!

42
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,420
Very good! Give her the number.
Next!

43
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,380
Please, be quiet over there!

44
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,340
Good, you with the Chinese hat!
Quiet!

45
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,100
Incredible! I've been looking
for you for three hours!

46
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,020
How could I go home without you?
Look what a mess you're in!

47
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,660
Just look what a mess you're in!
Stand up!

48
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,540
You deserve a good smack!
Now you're crying?

49
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,660
Look at you! Damn!

50
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,980
You're all dirty. You drive me crazy!

51
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,820
- They called you over the megaphone!
- Mummy!

52
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,820
What do you want from Mummy?

53
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,620
What did she do wrong?

54
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,660
She nearly gave me a heart attack.

55
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,940
I've been looking for her
all over Cinecittà!

56
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
They won't let us back in.
Are you happy?

57
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,820
- Are you here for the contest?
- Yes! Look what a mess she's in.

58
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,860
She looks like St. Lazarus!
Come here!

59
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,860
If I had to take a child to the
contest, I'd leave her like that.

60
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,820
All dirty? Beautiful!

61
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,140
They're prettier grubby and with
their hair tossed. They look nicer.

62
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,820
It's you who's nice.

63
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,060
She has a pretty face.

64
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,260
She's photogenic.
And she has lovely eyes.

65
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,140
Let me see!
Really lovely eyes!

66
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,420
Good thing! Let's hope they pick you.
Come on!

67
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
- Goodness! I'm lost now.
- I think they're at n. 5.

68
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
- What's that?
- Studio n. 5.

69
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
How do I get there?
I'm completely lost!

70
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,900
- I'll take you there.
- You will?

71
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,340
- Sure.
- How kind! Thanks. Let's go!

72
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,140
Wait till we get home!

73
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
This is the little girl who got lost!

74
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,900
- The lady can go in through here.
- If you say so!

75
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,220
I brought some photos of her.
Did I do the right thing?

76
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,820
- She really is a pretty child!
- At this age, they're all pretty!

77
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,580
Right. They're all pretty,
but I prefer their mothers!

78
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,380
Listen, allow me to give you
a piece of advice:

79
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,740
the second time
the test will be a bit harder

80
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,060
and these photos
won't help you much.

81
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,980
- They're not very good.
- Yes.

82
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,620
You need to get them re-done larger
and better by a professional.

83
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,220
- I will.
- I can give you an address.

84
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,180
- That'd be great!
- Tell him I sent you.

85
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm Alberto Annovazzi.

86
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,060
The photographer
is at 14, Via Quattro Fontane.

87
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Go to him. He's a real artist.

88
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,020
I'll go there! Thank you so much.

89
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,580
- Not at all.
- I don't know how to thank you.

90
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,220
- Can I go in?
- It leads straight to the studio.

91
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,780
- If I hadn't run into you...
- Best of luck!

92
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,860
- Say bye-bye!
- Bye! Don't run off again.

93
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,900
- I'll hold onto her tight!
- That's best.

94
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,940
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

95
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,100
Good. Well done, little one!
What's your name?

96
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
Mario! Give her a number.

97
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,980
Now, the other little girl
who is waiting her turn.

98
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,020
Come forward.
Madam, we're not at the races!

99
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,860
The incident's over!
Go back to your places! Enough!

100
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,140
Back to your places!
The incident is over!

101
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,180
This is the child who got lost!

102
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,140
- Ah, that one!
- I lost sight of her!

103
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,340
- Where?
- I don't know!

104
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,060
- It's a village, you can get lost.
- Where was she?

105
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,060
- Near the pool!
- Silence, please!

106
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,340
For goodness' sake! Quiet!
Where did you find her?

107
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,860
- Near the pool, fishing!
- She got dirty.

108
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,140
Yes. I struggle to iron her dress!

109
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,020
- Cute! What's your name?
- Maria!

110
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,300
- He didn't catch that.
- Maria!

111
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,020
Nice! Maria what?

112
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,420
- Maria...
- Zecconi!

113
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,740
- Zecconi!
- No. She lisps slightly.

114
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
- So, what's her surname?
- Cecconi.

115
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,300
Cecconi.
Repeat: "Maria Cecconi".

116
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,900
Okay, maybe she likes that way.

117
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,180
When I made the announcement
you were looking for your girl,

118
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,740
but I said the child has to be
6-7 years old and no younger!

119
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,260
- Mr. Blasetti, she's 7.
- She's a little...

120
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,540
You find her small?

121
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,260
The dress makes her look small.

122
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,220
To tell the truth,
she hasn't grown much this year!

123
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,740
She will. For sure!
What are you going to do for us?

124
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Do you dance? Sing? Or what?

125
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,140
- Venice.
- You're doing Venice!

126
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,020
Mr. Blasetti won't understand!

127
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,660
- The poem on Venice!
- Fine! Off you go!

128
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,740
- Do you want to hear it?
- Of course!

129
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,620
<i>Venice, your final hour has come</i>

130
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,340
<i>Illustrious martyr, you are lost</i>

131
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>The plague is spreading,
we are starving,</i>

132
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>A white flag
is fluttering on the bridge</i>

133
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,900
Did you teach her that?

134
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,860
Did you teach her that?
She's a star!

135
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,860
She didn't recite it that well
even at Christmas!

136
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,020
Come on, don't waste time. It's 2pm.

137
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,340
If we get to the stadium late,
it'll be full,

138
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
we'll be standing like idiots!
Hurry up!

139
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,540
I've had enough,
I don't feel like coming.

140
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,860
What?
You're not coming to the match?

141
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Bruno, did you hear him?

142
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
There's nothing odd about it.
I'm worried.

143
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,380
She's been out since this morning
and she has the child with her.

144
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,300
Why hasn't she turned up?
I'm not coming, don't insist!

145
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,300
She said: "I'm going to give
an injection in Monteverde".

146
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,700
Where do you expect her to go?

147
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,700
What's the point of going
as far as Monteverde to give shots?

148
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,380
It's Sunday and the tram
costs 20 cents each way,

149
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,140
and the child pays full fare.

150
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Your wife is nuts!
Come on, Franco, drink your coffee.

151
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,780
See what you've done?
This idiot's always laughing!

152
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,940
- Drink your coffee!
- Can't you see it's boiling?

153
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,780
Mum, it's best not to fret over her.

154
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,140
- She does as she likes anyway.
- Make her respect you!

155
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Right! Make her respect you!
Once and for all!

156
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Do you know what I think?
She didn't go to Monteverde!

157
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,660
What are you saying?
She has your daughter with her.

158
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,780
That's the reason!
Because she has the child with her!

159
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Come on! Let's go! It's 3pm
and we're still chatting! It's late!

160
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's go, Spartaco! Hurry!

161
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Give her another kiss!
Mum, you're always the same!

162
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,380
- I dropped food on myself.
- I'll clean you up. Bye!

163
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,780
- Won't you kiss my forehead?
- Bye! Don't catch too much sun!

164
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,540
- Don't worry!
- When you see Maddalena...

165
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,780
I'll tell her not to bring
the child with her any more.

166
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,220
- She hasn't eaten yet!
- Don't take it out on her.

167
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,900
I won't, don't worry.
Bye-bye. See you soon.

168
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,540
- Have a good time!
- Come on!

169
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,340
Spartaco! Your wife's there!

170
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,020
There she is!

171
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,340
- I want to know where you've been!
- Spartaco!

172
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,380
Slow down!
You're in such a hurry now.

173
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,220
- I did go!
- Where?

174
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,500
To Cinecittà,
for the film role contest!

175
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,700
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy or not, they picked her!

176
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,300
- Who?
- Our daughter, not me! If only!

177
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,300
Don't tell lies.
You're always telling fibs!

178
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,940
Leave her be, she always does what
she wants. And she's always talking!

179
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,380
Let's go, the match is starting.

180
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,380
Why don't you mind
your own business?

181
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,780
Don't you talk
to my brother like that.

182
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm coming with you.

183
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,020
No, you go home
and feed the child.

184
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,620
- Your mother can do it.
- You feed her!

185
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,100
- Take me to the movies tonight!
- I'll give you the movies!

186
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,340
We'll discuss tonight.
Let's go, Franco!

187
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,740
- What needs discussing?
- She's always talking!

188
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,940
- Cut it out!
- Bye, Maddalena.

189
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
We're going to the movies, right?

190
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,900
Be serious and take the child home
to feed her!

191
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,500
You grouch! Come on! Bye!

192
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,180
Two, three, four.

193
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,340
One, two, three, four.

194
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Mrs. Molteni!

195
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,740
What do you want, Maria?

196
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,580
I can't hear you! Shout louder!

197
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,500
They start waking people up
very early in the morning, dammit!

198
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,220
What do you want, Maria?

199
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,340
- Is my mother up there?
- No, she's not here, Maria!

200
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,740
She's at Margherita's giving her
an injection. I'll call her.

201
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,660
Mrs. Maddalena!

202
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,500
- What's up?
- Maria's looking for you!

203
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,700
- Who?
- Your daughter's looking for you!

204
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,380
What do you want?

205
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,580
Mummy, there is a lady
who wants coffee!

206
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,340
- I can't understand you! What?
- A lady wants coffee!

207
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,060
You're holding me up. I'm giving
an injection. I'll be right down.

208
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Be good, now!
Thank you so much, Madam.

209
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,940
Mummy's on her way.

210
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,060
She's giving a lady an injection.

211
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,140
You see this egg?

212
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,060
God sees and provides.

213
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,100
- Your daughter's been calling you.
- I know!

214
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,860
Is she ill?

215
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,620
She's fine, she was picked!
We're going to the photographer.

216
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,500
When are you going to have
this baby? Hurry up!

217
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,780
You're always on the stairs.
Go home!

218
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,820
Mrs. Gisella, please, ask your
daughter to do Maria's homework.

219
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,060
We're going to the photographer's.
She was picked! Bye-bye!

220
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,180
She's mad! That fanatic!

221
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
For heaven's sake, don't choke!

222
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,300
Is this the lady
who wanted some coffee?

223
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,940
Do excuse me. I had
a sort of cramp in my stomach.

224
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,500
I asked for a drop of coffee.

225
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,740
We don't have any. We do have
some eggs, but I see that...

226
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,180
- They're better.
- Yes, I know they're better.

227
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,100
- Excuse me, but who are you?
- How silly of me, you don't know me.

228
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm Tilde Spernanzoni.

229
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,020
The actress.

230
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,220
- What?
- The actress.

231
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,860
I've given up the stage now,
I'm tired.

232
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,780
When you get to a certain age,
you have to rest.

233
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,700
Anyway, you have to make way
for the young.

234
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,540
I do a little film work.

235
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,860
Mummy!

236
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,660
- The lady drank an egg.
- It doesn't matter. Don't worry.

237
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,860
Little blabbermouth!

238
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,940
This is the child who was chosen
for the second test?

239
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,740
Dear lady, who sent you here?
Cinecittà? Stella Film? Who?

240
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,900
No one.

241
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Someone must have sent you.
You're wasting my time!

242
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,220
An acquaintance gave me the names
of the ones who were chosen.

243
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
She's pretty, very pretty.

244
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,380
Take my hand, dear.
Give me your hand. Good girl!

245
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,740
While Mummy's making some coffee
with lots of sugar,

246
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,100
you'll recite something for me.

247
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,820
It's nice here! You have a garden!
Wonderful! Will you come with me?

248
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,660
- Let's go into the garden.
- Yes, it's a real palace!

249
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,300
Thank goodness we're moving.
Where are you going?

250
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,020
I've already asked
and she doesn't need lessons.

251
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,020
They want her just as she is,

252
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,580
provided she's bright
and intelligent. Look at her face.

253
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,740
My daughter doesn't need coaching.
Anyway, we can't afford it.

254
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,180
I see, but for our children
we can make sacrifices.

255
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,620
- But...
- Our children are our children!

256
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,620
Come here, dear, come here!

257
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,340
Have you turned up to teach me
how to bring up children?

258
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,340
You're holding us up.
We're going to the photographer.

259
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,540
How else can I put it to you?
Be reasonable!

260
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,300
- You'll go there later.
- What?

261
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,700
Where are you going?

262
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,540
Maria, recite
"The final hour of Venice".

263
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,500
She'll be satisfied and we can go!

264
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,860
What a clever girl!
Say "The final hour of Venice".

265
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,020
- I want to hear that poem.
- Who ever sent her here?

266
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,340
Who ever sent that mad woman
to my house?

267
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,660
You come home happy and
you find a mad woman in the house.

268
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,260
"I'm an actress..." She tells you
her life history. "I'm retired..."

269
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,180
I've so many problems of my own,
I'll give her coffee so she'll go.

270
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,140
How much time we're wasting here!
"I'm tired", "Now I'm teaching"...

271
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,140
But she's far from being mad!

272
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,540
You're tired,
but you drank three eggs!

273
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,260
What bad manners! How uncouth!
I'd best lock the meat up.

274
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,260
Now, we're wasting half an hour
to let her hear a poem?

275
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,620
It's simply incredible!

276
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,900
We'll miss our appointment
with the photographer!

277
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,860
Have you nothing better to do?
In this heat!

278
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,580
It's nice and cool at the park!
Instead of drinking others' eggs!

279
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
This really bothers me!

280
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,140
I can't accept it!

281
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,780
- Excuse me! Listen!
- Is the coffee ready?

282
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,100
I'm making it. Do you want it sweet?
With lots of sugar?

283
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,740
The little girl is talented.

284
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,940
But she'll get to poetry later!
Now, it's too soon.

285
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,420
It's tiring for her.

286
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,220
I'll teach her something myself.

287
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,580
We'll find a suitable,
quiet spot. Let's see.

288
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,060
Here we are! Take my hand, dear.
Come with me.

289
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,820
Come with me, here we are!
You'll see what I have to teach you.

290
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,700
This is an ideal spot.

291
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,780
Come with me. Good girl!

292
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,580
Imagine you're in a meadow,

293
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,300
a large, green meadow
that's cool, like here.

294
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,420
You're here to pick strawberries.

295
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,100
Excuse me! Excuse me!
She's even deaf.

296
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,940
The first exercise is
in role-playing.

297
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,740
Imagining yourself in a situation.
Do you like strawberries?

298
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,540
So you're happy
to pick strawberries.

299
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,780
Oh! Look how many strawberries
there are under that oak!

300
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,500
She's mad!
Where can she see an oak?

301
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,780
Run, run! Pick them! Go on!
Bend down, there's a good girl.

302
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,900
Pick them! There are so many!
Look how many there are!

303
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,820
And that silly girl listens to her.

304
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,340
Excuse me,
but you're sapping her brain.

305
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,220
Maria, what are you up to?
What are you doing?

306
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,380
She's picking strawberries,
isn't she?

307
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Can't you see
she's picking strawberries?

308
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,540
Give it to me. What a lovely one!
Bend down and pick it, dear.

309
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,060
You see?

310
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,140
- They don't understand anything.
- If she doesn't leave...

311
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,860
Maria, hurry!

312
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,060
How long does it take you
to come here, sweetheart? Hurry!

313
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Come on, you're making me late.

314
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,980
She drove us both crazy.
Who is that woman?

315
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,620
You must only listen to Mummy.
You're making me late! Come on!

316
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,380
Goodness me...

317
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Wash your hands.
Wait! Let Mummy pour the water.

318
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,860
Pick up the soap! Be quick!

319
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,300
Look what a state you're in.
Where did you go, in the coal shed?

320
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,020
Oh, what a slowcoach!

321
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,820
Can't you go any faster?
Now, rinse your hands properly.

322
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,420
Give your face a wash too.
Look what a state you're in.

323
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,340
Hurry, while Mummy gets ready.

324
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,620
How odd that woman is!

325
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,060
"Honey, pick the strawberries".
She was just pretending!

326
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,820
She was teaching you to act.
Yes, right, to act.

327
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,420
What is there to acting?

328
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,660
If I thought I was someone else,

329
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,940
if I pretended
to be someone else,

330
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,580
I'd be acting.

331
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,060
You're not interested, are you?

332
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,580
It's like when you say that poem,
the one about the butterfly.

333
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,180
"I'm a butterfly,
half white and half yellow."

334
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,820
The one you recite with
your hands like that! Show me!

335
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,580
I'm a butterfly,
half white and half yellow.

336
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,940
How do you move your hands?

337
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,580
My goodness!
You see that you can act!

338
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,140
You see you can act too?

339
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,740
But don't stutter, sweetheart,
otherwise they won't pick you?

340
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,580
You must speak without stuttering.
Do you understand?

341
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Picking strawberries...
Listen to your Mummy.

342
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,780
All the mothers in this block
make me laugh:

343
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
"My daughter, my daughter..."
They don't have what it takes!

344
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,020
You're my daughter,
you certainly can be an actress!

345
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,340
You can be an actress, you know?

346
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,940
I could have, if I'd wanted to.

347
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,060
Come here and let me fix your hair.
What a mess you're in!

348
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,340
How would you look
with a centre parting?

349
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Oh, Lord! You look ugly like that!

350
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,580
No, let's leave it.
All combed back, like Mummy!

351
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,740
Let's see.

352
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,780
Let's see how you look.
My beautiful potato!

353
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,060
Let's fix your plaits.

354
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,980
Let me see.

355
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,220
These plaits!

356
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
But... But you're cute!

357
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,820
You look pretty like that!
You look simpler and more natural.

358
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,180
Today, we'll just do the photo.
We can't afford anything else.

359
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,060
Understood? Understood?

360
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,060
Mummy, am I going back
to school tomorrow?

361
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,700
Oh, my Goodness! You're stuttering
and lisping. What are we to do?

362
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,940
Repeat it.

363
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,620
Louder!

364
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,300
What are you up to?
Are you doing it on purpose?

365
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,900
You never stuttered before.
You never lisped.

366
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,740
Pronounce it properly.

367
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
You can't speak Roman dialect
if you want to be an actress!

368
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,540
What's happening here?
Come here, next to Mummy.

369
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
This is a problem a real problem.

370
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,140
No, no, without lisping!

371
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
You're making me lisp too!
What's going on?

372
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Here! Take your shoes
and go and get dress in there.

373
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
Put on your socks and shoes.

374
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,780
Then put on the dress
that's on the coffee table.

375
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Don't toss your hair!

376
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,660
Do you have to stand there every
time I open the window? Scram!

377
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,860
What a brazen boy! At his age!

378
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,500
What a house this is! It's crazy!
They come right into your flat!

379
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,620
I'm lisping too! Really!

380
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
What's going on here?

381
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,140
Are you ready?

382
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,500
Don't toss your hair putting on
your dress, or you'll get a smack!

383
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,180
That's too high a pitch! Ready?

384
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,220
We have to do everything
in a hurry...

385
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,980
You're still there!
You're bothering me.

386
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,300
Supposing that mad woman's right?
Maybe you do need to study...

387
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,500
Is lisping a family trait?
Are you ready?

388
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,820
What's she like?

389
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,580
Show me.

390
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,820
There she is! Just a moment.

391
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,700
- What pose are you putting her in?
- This one. How's that?

392
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,980
That's not suitable!

393
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,340
- Put her in the tomboy one.
- Don't interfere!

394
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,780
Sorry. My wife's been an invalid
so long, she likes to get involved.

395
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,220
Let's hurry, now!
Would you like to choose a pose?

396
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,820
- Now, poppet, sit up straight!
- Put her in the pose I suggested!

397
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,580
I thought you knew each other.
That would be normal,

398
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,740
both here for the contest
and acquaintances of Annovazzi.

399
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,260
Me? I hardly know him.

400
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,820
Lift up your chin, won't you?
Come on!

401
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,980
Lift up your chin!
Keep your head straight!

402
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,540
I met him at Cinecittà
and he was interested in my girl.

403
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,340
Look over there, over there.
Don't cry!

404
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,580
Mummy's sweetheart!
Let's take a nice picture.

405
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,780
It was he who advised me
to come to you.

406
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Because he particularly liked
her eyes.

407
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,060
Why are you crying, sweetheart?

408
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,340
Poor thing, she's not used to this
and she's a little scared!

409
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,580
Smile, come on! Smile!

410
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,580
Your daughter takes ballet classes.

411
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,580
They have to dance in the film.

412
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,820
- Not at all! Who said it?
- I thought they did!

413
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,380
Because one of the little girls
I photographed

414
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,900
was from the Opera school.

415
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,220
- The Ruskaja School.
- No, the Opera school!

416
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,500
- The Ruskaja School!
- That woman!

417
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,820
Excuse me, but are you sure
they have to dance?

418
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,620
In the novel the film is based on
the little girl dances.

419
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,580
I've read it!
That's exactly how it starts!

420
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,980
I do believe you're mistaken.
I don't want to insist.

421
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,500
It starts with her saying
she can't stand it any more.

422
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,100
Yes, it starts like that,

423
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,100
then the girl dances around
the table on her birthday.

424
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,220
No. She tells him she's leaving him.
He wants to kill her.

425
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,980
The girl is very happy
because it's her birthday.

426
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,340
She's cheerful and dances and hops,
there's a cake on the table!

427
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,780
In the book, the girl dances!

428
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,020
Excuse me.

429
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,380
Anyhow, if they can dance,
it'll be for the better, won't it?

430
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,820
No, she doesn't have to dance!

431
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,780
- Ready?
- Wait! I just need to settle her!

432
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,980
- A big smile!
- Please step aside!

433
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,060
A big smile! Look at the camera,
he'll take a nice photo of you!

434
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,580
There we are!

435
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,540
- You nearly set me on fire!
- It all went fine!

436
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,860
The bang will have frightened her
and she'll have closed her eyes!

437
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,820
No, they were wide open!

438
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
- Did you watch them carefully?
- Don't worry!

439
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,700
- They're what I'm worried about!
- I'm busy now.

440
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,740
- I'm the photographer!
- No need to lose your patience!

441
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,700
Now it's the turn of the pretty girl.

442
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,700
- How did you have your eyes?
- Open.

443
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,420
You tell so many lies.
Were you feeling afraid?

444
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,380
We risk wasting time
and money here. Excuse me...

445
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,980
When shall I come
for the negatives?

446
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,140
- This evening. Tomorrow, rather.
- This evening, please!

447
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Why not yesterday?
I can't do them for this evening!

448
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,660
- Come tomorrow, they'll be ready.
- You're so kind!

449
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,260
Do you want to take it home?
Mummy will get you one like it!

450
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,780
It's really late, now.
Daddy will be starving!

451
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,900
- Goodbye! Thank you.
- Goodbye.

452
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,700
You know what the photos are for.
I'm in your hands!

453
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,020
Don't worry.

454
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,700
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Say goodbye to the gentleman!

455
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,500
Are you ready for your shot?

456
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,140
- Yes I am!
- So am I, I'm almost ready.

457
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,660
- Thank goodness.
- Decide where you want to have it.

458
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,020
I have. On the right again.

459
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,900
Always on the right!
You're full of holes there!

460
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,780
It hurts on the other side!

461
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,540
Very well. The right side it is!
But if it hurts, don't complain!

462
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,060
- What is it? Penicillin?
- No, we've finished with that.

463
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,180
You've had 8 million shots.

464
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,180
- So what are you giving me?
- We're back on Balerofosforo!

465
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,300
- I've had a whole box of that!
- You need another. You're run-down!

466
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,860
Look at the white of your eyes!

467
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,820
You're heavy,
but you have no strength!

468
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,220
Let's hope it helps!

469
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,060
What a chatterbox! I'm wasting time
here and I've so much to do!

470
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,500
Are you ready?
I must ask you for a favour.

471
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,620
- May I make a phone call?
- Of course! Naturally!

472
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,060
You're still lying there?
Come on! Show me where you want it!

473
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,140
I must phone my daughter.

474
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,260
We had the photos done!
They came out very well.

475
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,420
Don't hold me up, now!
Come on! Turn over!

476
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,980
Careful with that
or you'll set fire to the bed!

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,900
Hurry up! Turn over!

478
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,700
- Come on, skinny!
- Don't hurt me!

479
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,660
You're nice and plump!
Who enjoys all this abundance?

480
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,340
- Relax your leg.
- Don't hurt me!

481
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,820
Don't delay me. I must stop in on
the Commendatore.

482
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,180
- What's he got?
- Diabetes.

483
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,340
- He's worse off than you.
- That's life!

484
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,900
You'll get it too if you go on
eating, smoking, drinking...

485
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,980
They're vices.
I can't give them up.

486
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,740
- You're mad! Relax this leg.
- All right, but don't hurt me!

487
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,140
You hurt me!

488
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,660
You make me break out in a sweat
every time I give you a shot!

489
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,660
You didn't even feel the needle!

490
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,220
I have a very light hand!

491
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,860
The Commendatore, the diabetic,
says he only has his shots from me.

492
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
- He's in love with you!
- What do I care?

493
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,940
As long as he has his injections.
There you are, as good as new!

494
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,580
Rub the spot yourself.
I need to make that phone call.

495
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,140
- Go on, then!
- Thanks.

496
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,220
If you don't mind,
I'll move the phone over there.

497
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,100
All this stuff is open.
I don't want to spill anything!

498
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
- Come in!
- Are you expecting company?

499
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,860
It's my breakfast.

500
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,860
- Lord! You're having four eggs?
- I have to keep my strength up!

501
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,300
Your liver must be bombproof!

502
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,020
- What's she got to complain about?
- Who knows!

503
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,140
- Do you want an injection as well?
- No, I don't need one, do I?

504
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,620
- You do! You do!
- I don't need any injections.

505
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,060
You do! Can't you see how fat
you are? I'll help you slim down!

506
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,260
- She's huge! Where did you find her?
- Who knows?

507
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Hello! Mrs. Gisella?

508
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,620
Listen, this is Mrs. Cecconi.

509
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,580
Would you do me a favour?

510
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,620
Thanks. My little girl
is in the courtyard.

511
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,020
Would you please tell her...
No, don't bother to go down.

512
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,500
Call down from your balcony
and tell her

513
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,660
that I'm not coming and
she is to carry on with her lesson.

514
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,700
What do you mean, what lesson?
Acting! She's with her teacher.

515
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,220
Right! And tell her we'll collect
those things tomorrow.

516
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,260
We've even crossed paths
with a black cat!

517
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,900
Has he died by any chance?

518
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,340
- Who is it?
- Oh, you've answered at last!

519
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,380
- It's me, Mrs. Cecconi!
- Oh, right! Sorry!

520
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,700
She's locked herself in.

521
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,300
- Do come in!
- Another black cat!

522
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,260
- Don't be afraid. Come in.
- No. How is the attorney?

523
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,580
- Oh Lord, another one!
- Well, actually...

524
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,220
He's not well.

525
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
He has a fever again.

526
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,580
The doctor says he has
to go back to taking

527
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,260
the streptomycin every 12 hours.

528
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,860
And not to stop
even if his fever goes down!

529
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,940
- Of course he shouldn't!
- This was to be your last visit.

530
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,620
But you'll have to come back,
my dear.

531
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,940
- Thank goodness for that!
- What do you mean?

532
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,740
No, I meant for him, poor man!

533
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,060
I'll be right there. Just a moment.

534
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,780
I'll get my syringe and go through.

535
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
- Quietly, please.
- I'll walk on tip toe!

536
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,420
How could I do otherwise?
He's unwell, fortunately!

537
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,380
In five days, I'll pay for her dress.
Thank you, St. Joseph!

538
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,220
You're so kind to me!
I'll light a candle to you, later.

539
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,300
Eleonora!

540
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,500
What are you up to? We've been
waiting for you for an hour!

541
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,140
- Just a moment! Here I am!
- Don't keep the lady waiting!

542
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,780
This is all the tulle I've found!

543
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,180
But the storerooms are full of it!
You're making me look bad!

544
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,860
- That's all there is!
- Nonsense!

545
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,300
Look, Madam.

546
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,100
- Do you like it, Madam?
- Lovely! Just like a cloud!

547
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
- Let me feel it, Miss!
- Here!

548
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,060
A little hard, isn't it?

549
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
It's a pre-war fabric.
I'll sell it to you cheap.

550
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,260
- This is better.
- At cost price!

551
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,540
- This is nice and soft.
- You see?

552
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,740
This is the pattern
with a fluffy tulle skirt!

553
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,140
It's a classical tutu with
a sleeveless satin bodice.

554
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
- I see.
- Have you seen "The Red Shoes"?

555
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I'll make it identical to that one.
Don't worry! You'll love it!

556
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,780
How pretty you'll look!
Here! Do you like it?

557
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
It's the price that worries me.

558
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,740
Don't worry! I'll ask a fair price!

559
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,540
Since I'm a little short after
all I've had to spend on her,

560
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,820
at times, you never know,
one can think that...

561
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,260
I'm a nurse,
should you ever need shots!

562
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,220
Dear lady, are you joking?

563
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,540
If there's one thing I enjoy,
it's really good health!

564
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,020
You don't have shots
only when you're at death's door!

565
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,620
You have them when you're well,
as a tonic, to give you a boost!

566
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,620
- Are you here to bring me bad luck?
- You've misunderstood.

567
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,060
Maybe at home you've a relative
who needs a course of treatment.

568
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,940
What? I'm fine as I am
without you making holes in me.

569
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,100
And my family too. Right, girls?
Tell her we're bursting with health!

570
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,060
You can't get round me, you know?
Come here, dear. I'll measure you.

571
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,820
Come on!

572
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,300
She's cute!
She's about my daughter's age.

573
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,540
- Yes, she's very young.
- Right!

574
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,740
Oh, goodness!

575
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Excuse me, but must she always
stay so close to the wall?

576
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,940
She'll hurt herself like that!

577
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,300
Don't worry! She won't hurt herself!
It takes time.

578
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,980
We're in a hurry! Why doesn't she
put her with the others?

579
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,100
Aren't I right?

580
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,380
Always stuck to the wall?

581
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,940
Excuse me, does my daughter always
have to stay stuck to the wall?

582
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,620
It's been three hours.
Put her with the others!

583
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,660
But they've been studying
for two or three years.

584
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,260
You marched in here saying:
"Make her dance like a butterfly".

585
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,700
Where's your common sense?
You're asking for a lot!

586
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,340
That child is very small!
She isn't old enough for ballet!

587
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
- How old does she need to be?
- Eight!

588
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,620
Am I supposed to wait three years?

589
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,260
Do as you think best!
Anyway, her little legs...

590
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,860
Her legs? Look at them closely!
Her legs are as straight as a dart!

591
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,420
Straight legs are not enough!
You need other things.

592
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,180
You need intelligence. You dance
with your brain, not your feet!

593
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,340
What?

594
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,020
You dance with your brain,
not your feet!

595
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,420
She has a good brain. She was born
healthy, she wasn't born backward!

596
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,620
That's your opinion!
You're getting on my nerves!

597
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,540
We're the teachers! We decide
if a child is intelligent or not.

598
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,940
I decide because I'm her mother!

599
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,540
I assure you
my daughter is not stupid!

600
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:55,220
Sweetheart,
why are you crying like that?

601
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,580
They're not going to hurt you.
You too will become a good dancer.

602
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,340
Look at that girl!
How good she is!

603
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,500
Look! Can you see her?
Do you want to become like them?

604
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,420
You'll learn to be good too!

605
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,820
Did you have to make her cry?
How rude you are!

606
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,700
We're going home now.
Give Mummy a nice smile!

607
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,100
Don't let Daddy see you crying!
Let's go home! Come on!

608
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,740
Naturally, the child is rather
disheartened now,

609
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,580
but I must make it clear that
here, we study, study, study.

610
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,900
I've been dancing for 40 years,
but if I didn't practice daily,

611
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,420
these arabesques,
these temps levés...

612
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,620
You see these steps?
I couldn't do them!

613
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,500
You tell her, Placida!

614
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,660
Unfortunately, it's the truth,
you have to study

615
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,660
and sweat, sweat, sweat!

616
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,820
That's the way it is!

617
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,780
Hello, Spartaco.

618
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,300
Now you go out after dinner?
And you take the child with you?

619
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,660
What could I do? You weren't here.
Was I to leave her on her own?

620
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,020
- Where have you been?
- Giving injections.

621
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,060
- Say hello to Daddy, won't you?
- Hello, Daddy.

622
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,980
Daddy's little darling!
Give Daddy a kiss!

623
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,580
- Maddalena!
- Yes?

624
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,180
The instalments aren't
60,000 lire, but 65,000.

625
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,740
How come?

626
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,500
The lift has to be paid for.
We didn't include it.

627
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,820
Everyone's paid for it,
and so will we.

628
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
What happened to you, poppet?

629
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,900
- Tell Daddy what happened.
- I'm tired.

630
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,700
Daddy's little sweetheart!

631
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,660
This is the new house
that Daddy has bought you.

632
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,300
We're putting your bed here.

633
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
And Daddy will buy you a Pinocchio.

634
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,980
Do you know the story of Pinocchio?

635
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,940
The boy whose nose grew longer
because of all the lies he told.

636
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,860
He lied to his father,
an old man who...

637
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,980
There's only 60,000 lire here.

638
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,420
I don't have another cent.

639
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,900
How will we manage?

640
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,220
Spartaco, do we absolutely have
to pay the instalment on Monday?

641
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,820
Yes, on Monday.
We're only 5,000 short.

642
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,580
You'll just have to ask
for some arrears!

643
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,220
Didn't you feed the little one?

644
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,580
So now I'm starving her!
That's all we need!

645
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,660
She had a cup of coffee and milk
and two buns. Tell him!

646
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,020
- That wasn't much!
- Tell him!

647
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,700
- Leave it!
- Mummy will undress you.

648
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,860
- I'll do it!
- You'll tear her dress!

649
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,340
There! You undress her.

650
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,580
Daddy will put you to bed.

651
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,980
Tomorrow, I'll take her out
and buy her a big ice cream.

652
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,340
Ice cream's bad for her tummy.

653
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,420
- Maddalena, go away!
- You know I do whatever you say.

654
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,780
See how tired the child seems!
Look!

655
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,740
What do you want from me?

656
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,620
How pretty you are.
The baby of the family!

657
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,140
Do you love your Daddy?
Give me a kiss and a pinch.

658
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Tomorrow Daddy's taking you
for an ice cream all the same.

659
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,820
Are you happy?

660
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,260
- So, are you coming?
- I have a lesson tomorrow!

661
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,020
No, you're coming with Daddy.
No lessons!

662
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,700
Give Daddy a kiss.

663
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,100
Be good! Go to sleep now.
I'm turning off the light.

664
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,180
You see? It's Montgomery Clift.
He's nice, isn't he?

665
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,100
Maddalena,
forget about the cinema!

666
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,580
Spartaco, you don't understand me!

667
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,980
Look what lovely places!

668
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,620
Look where we're living.

669
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,700
When I see those things, I...

670
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,300
- Maddalena, it's all make-believe.
- It's not make-believe!

671
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,260
Oh! Look!
They're taking the wagon across!

672
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,700
Incredible!

673
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,180
All the horses are in the water!

674
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,340
Lucky them, having a bath!

675
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,340
Isn't that fantastic?

676
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,380
It's fantastic!

677
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,540
I'm falling asleep.

678
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,340
- I can't keep my eyes open.
- Let's go to bed.

679
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,300
- No! I'm before her!
- Calm down! Calm down!

680
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,820
Stop being so pushy!

681
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,060
- Who's being pushy?
- Stay calm!

682
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,140
- He's holding my ticket!
- No! I'm first!

683
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,340
- Where must I go?
- In the room next door.

684
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,860
- Were you bitten by a tarantula?
- Such unfairness in this world!

685
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,340
- She never stops yakking!
- You're always so pushy!

686
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,220
Come here!
Don't you ever get tired?

687
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,980
- I am tired! I can hardly stand!
- It doesn't look like it!

688
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:52,700
Look, I had my granddaughter's
picture taken,

689
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,020
but I made her stand because
it looks better, doesn't it?

690
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,500
I only had one done
because they're so expensive!

691
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,620
- They told me one was enough.
- Of course it's enough.

692
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,380
Did you want to bring them a film?

693
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,620
My child only has one, too.

694
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,140
The photographer wanted
to take her while dancing.

695
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,740
I said to him: "She'll show
what she can do at the audition".

696
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,260
If they choose her for the audition.

697
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,260
I think they've already
made up their mind!

698
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,660
- Really?
- And we're all wasting our time.

699
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,940
If I hadn't seen it with
my own eyes, I'd keep quiet!

700
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,620
- What did you see?
- What did you see? Tell us!

701
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,340
I was here yesterday because
I got the dates mixed up...

702
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Got the dates mixed up! She came
on purpose to be here first!

703
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,900
No, it was a genuine mistake!

704
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,900
They were doing special auditions.

705
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,420
For the recommended candidates!

706
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,620
I saw them with my own eyes!

707
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,300
There was a lady with a little girl,

708
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,700
who didn't ask for the director!

709
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,420
No, no.
She asked for the other man!

710
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,260
- Who's that?
- The other one! That ugly man,

711
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,340
the fat one who's always
yelling into the megaphone.

712
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,500
- That nasty fellow.
- Glori!

713
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,340
As soon as he saw her he said:
"How cute this little girl is!".

714
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,980
"How pretty she is..."

715
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,940
What's wrong with that?
My child's pretty too!

716
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,980
"How pretty she is", looking at
the mother in the meantime.

717
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,420
What are you insinuating?
It was just an impression.

718
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,220
Don't exaggerate!

719
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,220
Sure! We're all stupid here!

720
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,980
I understood perfectly
what the lady was saying!

721
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:46,180
But we'll go to the producer
and the director and make a fuss!

722
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,940
It's a real disgrace!

723
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,660
Because there are some favourites,
some recommended candidates!

724
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,500
And we're all supposed to be equal.

725
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,300
It's not right! It's unfair!
We must do something about it!

726
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,180
My husband knows someone
who works here at Cinecittà.

727
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,300
I'll ask him to put in a good word
for me with Stella Film!

728
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,140
My husband is a close friend
of one of the phone company heads.

729
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,540
What does the phone company head
have to do with all this?

730
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:18,020
He's a personality too!

731
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,620
Don't make us laugh!

732
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,940
We can all find someone
to pull strings for us.

733
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,060
We can all find someone important!

734
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,980
I have a relative who's a friend
of a waiter in Cinecittà.

735
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,740
He knows him very well, really!
He's high up...

736
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,620
Amerigo! I'm in a big hurry!

737
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,300
- Bath, shower?
- No, we don't need them.

738
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:59,100
Just a trim and a couple of curls.

739
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,580
Go on in. Amerigo, a cut!

740
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,420
- Don't I get a receipt?
- No, you don't need one.

741
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,660
- The child needs an hair dye too.
- Are you crazy?

742
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,340
We need to lighten her hair, no?

743
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,980
If I take her home blonde,
all hell will be let loose!

744
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,740
But just a slight...

745
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,500
She just needs a trim.

746
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,500
- And a couple of curls.
- One moment, then it's your turn!

747
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,860
What... Where are you?
They're making us waste time here.

748
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,060
- Well, if it's just 5 minutes...
- Listen to me a moment!

749
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,100
- We'll give you a good tip!
- It's not a question of a tip.

750
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:41,380
But it's just a quick job!
These darned balloons!

751
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:47,500
Just trim her plaits
and make a couple of curls.

752
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,340
- I'm serving this lady!
- You've almost finished!

753
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,900
A quick rinse and she's off!

754
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,060
I haven't finished yet.
I've paid and I have my rights!

755
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,100
Are you going to keep on washing
her hair till tomorrow?

756
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,260
I have another client waiting!
You don't have an appointment!

757
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,580
- Just two minutes! Do me this favour!
- Sit her there, I'll do her later!

758
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,100
How jumpy you are!
The balloons don't bother you?

759
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,980
See how kind he is?
Now, sit here...

760
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,140
Give me the balloons,
I'll tie them here.

761
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,140
Do you mind if I tie them to this?

762
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:22,300
They'll keep you company.
Mummy will be right back! Be good!

763
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,540
- Will I make it in time?
- I think so.

764
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,900
If I don't come back,
Mrs. Spernanzoni will collect you.

765
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,300
If I'm not back in time, she'll be
picked up by middle-aged lady

766
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,660
who's called Tilde Spernanzoni.

767
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,420
A slightly odd lady! She's her acting
teacher. Understood, sweetheart?

768
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,700
- I don't want to stay here!
- What?

769
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,620
You have to stay!
They'll make you look pretty!

770
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,820
If you need to stay with her,
we'll go out another day.

771
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,180
No! I don't have to stay.

772
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:59,020
Fine. Remember to lighten her hair
to give it a softer tint.

773
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,340
- A hair dye.
- No! Are you joking?

774
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,300
Just highlights, natural streaks.

775
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,300
- Just touched up a little?
- And a light perm.

776
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,820
No! Don't spoil her hair!

777
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,700
Just a set, then. Her hair's fine
and won't stay in place!

778
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,820
- She got that from me.
- I could give you a nice hair-do...

779
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,500
You'd waste your time on me.
No one has managed that!

780
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,300
- I would!
- You'd be wasting your time.

781
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,220
- How much? I want to settle up now.
- 1,250 lire!

782
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,940
Do I pay out there? Fine.

783
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,420
- Well, let's go.
- Be a good girl, now.

784
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,260
Just a trim and a couple of curls.

785
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,980
So when I comb her hair,
it'll be all fluffy.

786
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,580
- Bye, honey! Be good!
- Let's go.

787
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,580
Mummy's coming back.

788
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,620
I don't want to stay here!

789
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,380
You're not alone, you're with him!
Behave nicely!

790
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,700
Be good! I'll look after you.
Be good!

791
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,260
I don't want to stay here!

792
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,380
Don't start! Be good!

793
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,300
If you behave, I'll buy you
some sweets afterwards.

794
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,340
You be good
and I'll give you some curls!

795
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:10,980
Amerigo, you have to set my hair!
It's still all wet!

796
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,740
I'll call Michele and he'll take
care of you! Just a minute!

797
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,220
- Michele, come here!
- I'll be right there!

798
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,380
I want to go home!
I want my Mummy!

799
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,700
- Give the little girl a trim.
- How can I? I'm busy.

800
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
- Call Guido!
- Okay.

801
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,220
Hurry up!

802
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,700
- I went to get the shampoo!
- Come on!

803
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,780
- I want to go to my Mummy!
- Guido, give her a trim.

804
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,500
Give the little girl a trim,
then maybe she'll pipe down!

805
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,940
- Amerigo, my set!
- Coming!

806
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,540
Listen, Guido,
just a simple trim.

807
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,420
Don't worry! I'll take care of her.

808
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,100
- Just a little trim?
- Yes, just a trim.

809
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,180
Let's cut it here... Here.

810
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,580
Here's one, young lady!

811
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,100
And the other!

812
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,140
Are you happy, Miss?
Is that all right?

813
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,740
I wonder what you think of me
asking you for an appointment.

814
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:42,260
When a lovely lady asks me for
an appointment, I think well of her!

815
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,380
If you take it like that, great!

816
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,980
I'm no longer so used
to walking so far.

817
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,380
Listen... Tell me frankly...

818
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,700
Do you think my girl will be picked?

819
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,980
I'm a little discouraged.

820
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:23,860
It happens, for no reason
something seems easy, natural,

821
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,380
then it no longer seems feasible.

822
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,900
You start feeling worried
about everything.

823
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,260
I don't know if you understand me.

824
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:36,420
I wouldn't like to make
so many sacrifices

825
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,940
then see the recommended one win!
You do understand me, don't you?

826
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,620
- Yes, but it depends on you.
- How can it be?

827
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,740
A recommendation can help
or hinder!

828
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,780
No, no! It helps!

829
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,820
No, you see, we're used
to recommendations.

830
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:57,300
If they were worth anything,
there'd be no unemployment!

831
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,300
In Italy
we live on recommendations:

832
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,980
"Please, don't forget...",
"I assure you, I promise..."

833
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,620
but we don't remember,
because we can't.

834
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,940
Who are we supposed to remember
and why should we remember them?

835
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,380
- There's only one foolproof method.
- What's that?

836
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,860
Putting the person who can help you

837
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,300
in a position to request to help you.
You see?

838
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,340
- No.
- Do you already want to leave?

839
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,780
No, it's so pleasant here.

840
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,340
I'd never been here.

841
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:31,940
Well, just once on a Sunday,
but it was very crowded.

842
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,500
It's so nice and peaceful today.

843
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:37,620
Yes, it's nice, but not on one's own.

844
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,420
You have to come to a place
like this in good company!

845
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,820
- Am I good company?
- Very.

846
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,300
If you like me,
do me this favour, won't you?

847
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,180
- I like you a lot!
- Better still!

848
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,300
I want my daughter to have
the best recommendation of all.

849
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,580
She has to do a screen test.

850
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,420
It's as if she'd already auditioned,
it's certain.

851
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,140
It's just that it depends on you.
That's simple, isn't it?

852
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,780
Now I understand.

853
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,980
You know what we say in Rome?
"Nothing given, nothing received."

854
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,340
As well as friendly,
you're also intelligent.

855
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,540
- Really? Everyone says so.
- And you're quick witted.

856
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,860
To make a big profit,
one must run a big risk!

857
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,220
50,000 lire sounds right to me.

858
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,100
You're crazy!
50,000 lire is 50,000 lire,

859
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,940
not a small sum!

860
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,180
Today, 50,000 lire is nothing.

861
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,780
To you! To me, lots of sacrifices,
don't even think about it!

862
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,740
It's the bare minimum
we need to reach our goal.

863
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,860
I'll manage the 50,000 lire
and get you a contract.

864
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,700
You'll earn,
at the very least, a million,

865
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,140
which is 20 times
the amount you staked.

866
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,580
Do you think I'll be spending it?

867
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,900
No, it's not for me, but for
the favours that will be needed.

868
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:17,740
- Who will you do these favours to?
- Everyone and no one!

869
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,700
Flowers for the producer's wife,
perfume for his mistress,

870
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,700
who is often the wife
of the leading actor.

871
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,740
In the film world that happens...

872
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,580
They don't need them, of course,
but they help since

873
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,580
these favours
remind them of a name.

874
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,380
In this case, your name.
Cecconi.

875
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,660
Kind Mrs. Cecconi
who sent that gift...

876
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:47,340
The word soon spreads. Have you
never thrown a stone into a pond?

877
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,500
The stone falls in just one spot
but from that spot

878
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:56,220
waves ripple out
until they reach the ocean.

879
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,540
- How shrewd you are!
- Shrewd...

880
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,340
It's just a practical way
of getting through life.

881
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,420
Am I to take this risk
with no guarantees?

882
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,180
What risk would it be otherwise?
Do you want a guarantee?

883
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,860
I'll give it to you!
Your child will have a screen test!

884
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,260
All right?

885
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,580
I accept.

886
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,700
I accept. I do have that sum.

887
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,820
I brought my savings book with me.

888
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,060
The trouble is
I need the money right away.

889
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,780
No problem!

890
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,540
Let's hurry.
The banks are closed

891
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,100
but a friend of mine is a clerk.
I'll swap the book for cash.

892
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,100
Then tomorrow morning,
she can withdraw the money.

893
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,740
Listen, Madam...
If it's difficult for you,

894
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,820
shall we forget the whole idea?

895
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,940
Especially since...

896
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,660
I'm sorry to have
business relations with you.

897
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,860
I'd have preferred, maybe,

898
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,860
I don't know...

899
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:16,100
It's fine by me. It's much better.

900
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,020
Let's hurry as it's late.

901
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,940
- Did you bring the money?
- Of course! Here it is!

902
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:40,420
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 50,000. The scooter?
- It's outside!

903
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,020
This is the scooter.
Do you like it?

904
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,900
I'm 10,000 lire short.

905
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,380
But who's complaining?
I'm just saying "stop"!

906
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,540
The little girl has learned enough!

907
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,700
Do you expect me to thank you?

908
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:50,340
Naturally! I'm used to being
thanked and respected!

909
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,180
I thank you and I respect you!

910
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,060
Did my wife pay you?
This is the door! Get out!

911
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:58,700
Your wife is the only person
who understands art!

912
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,700
Art, sure! Get out,
before I start swearing at you!

913
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,660
- Watch your language!
- What's all this racket?

914
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,900
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

915
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,220
It happens that I've had enough!

916
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,020
I don't want to see
strangers in my house!

917
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,620
I don't want my daughter...

918
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,220
I've never been fortunate,
but I have been respected!

919
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,940
Who's ruining your daughter?
That silly...

920
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,300
Don't exaggerate.

921
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:34,420
I've been so patient,
but now I've had enough!

922
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,100
Will you stop making a scene?

923
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:43,220
- Madam, please leave!
- Spartaco, stop that!

924
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,940
What did you do?

925
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,540
You're asking her? Where were you?

926
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,380
You left the child with this wretch!

927
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,260
- You're calling me a wretch?
- Yes, a wretch!

928
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:59,140
- I'm reporting you to the police!
- Spartaco, don't make such a fuss!

929
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,260
It looks short because it's curly.

930
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,780
I'll wet it and straighten it out.

931
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,700
- You'll make her catch bronchitis!
- I won't make her catch anything!

932
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:12,420
Didn't you notice anything?
Look at the state she's in!

933
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,780
- I'm not her nanny!
- So what?

934
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,900
- I'm an actress!
- Do you have no eyes?

935
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,860
Just because you're an actress,
if they cut off her head,

936
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,500
would you stand by and watch?

937
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,380
- Madam, this is the door!
- May I?

938
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,300
- Who's this?
- Is Mrs. Cecconi here?

939
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:32,100
Dressmakers Fracassini!
Shall I leave it here?

940
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,620
Did I get here in time?
I have the invoice with me.

941
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,300
- I must collect the balance.
- Thank you.

942
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,420
What did they do to you?
They gave you a "gamine" cut!

943
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,420
Don't take me for a fool!
Pay up what you owe me!

944
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,140
That's 1,260 lire.

945
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,620
1,000 for the lessons,

946
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,380
200 lire for the child's haircut

947
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,700
and 60 lire for the tram!

948
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:03,140
Madam, don't get agitated!
We'll pay in full! I'll see to it.

949
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:08,820
You won't see to anything!
You've got to stop this nonsense!

950
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,540
Don't you touch me!

951
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:15,060
How much does she owe you?
There, 1,260. Now, go!

952
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,140
- I'm 10 lire short!
- We'll give it to you!

953
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:22,780
- You can keep it!
- How generous! Now, go!

954
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,820
- You scoundrel!
- Get out!

955
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,340
You were right
to get her a "gamine" cut!

956
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,340
She'll feel cooler in the summer!
Won't you, honey?

957
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,060
Signorina, why don't you leave?

958
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,580
- What's in there?
- Don't touch it! It belongs to me!

959
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,300
- I paid for it with my money!
- No, it's my money too!

960
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,220
I never asked you for a cent
for these things!

961
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:47,740
Spartaco, please,
let's not fight over it!

962
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,700
You take advantage of me
because I'm weaker!

963
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,180
Can't you see
you're scaring the child?

964
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:59,820
For the last week, our life
has been turned upside down.

965
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,420
- Am I no longer in charge, here?
- I've had enough of you!

966
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,820
I've done far too much for you!
Is that clear? Get out of here!

967
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,620
- Get out!
- I'll kill you?

968
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,340
Concierge!

969
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,980
Come down!
He's killing Mrs. Cecconi!

970
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:24,740
- Concierge!
- What's going on?

971
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:29,020
Hurry! They're killing each other!
Concierge!

972
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:35,980
Just a minute!
I'm coming as fast as I can!

973
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,940
- The Cecconis are fighting!
- Of course! They're always at it!

974
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,260
Spartaco! What are you doing?

975
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,620
If you take the child away,
you won't see me again!

976
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,260
You won't see me again!

977
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,100
Take her away with you!

978
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,660
You always say
she's unhappy with me!

979
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,380
He's the only one who loves her.

980
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,020
Only he makes sacrifices for her.
I ruin her.

981
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:33,820
It's just because I want my daughter
to become somebody.

982
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,940
Yes, I want my daughter
to become somebody.

983
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,340
Do I have this right or not?

984
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:42,780
Or is it a crime?
She mustn't become a loser,

985
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,740
she mustn't depend on anyone,
she mustn't get beaten like me!

986
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,060
You don't know
what sacrifices I made

987
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,900
to find the money
to pay for these little things.

988
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:56,020
I went all over Rome
without telling him,

989
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:00,220
not to have to touch his money.
And how does he thank me?

990
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,500
He's beating me!
Get out!

991
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,620
I can't stand the sight of you!

992
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,220
Get out! You've ruined me!
I'm covered in bruises!

993
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:15,380
I'm covered in bruises!
Look, my face is swollen!

994
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,700
Go away!
I can't stand the sight of you!

995
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,700
You've ruined me!

996
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,860
Stop this play acting!
Come on!

997
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,140
I'm not play acting!

998
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:35,820
Come on, Mr. Spartaco...
She's made so many sacrifices!

999
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:40,500
She went to the other side of Rome
for a diabetic! What more do you ask?

1000
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,380
Give her the child!

1001
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,060
We'll settle this score later!

1002
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:54,620
This man will be the death of me!

1003
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:57,340
Give me the child!

1004
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,060
We made it.

1005
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,860
If we didn't do that,
we wouldn't have got an audition!

1006
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:11,340
My dear, am I working for nothing?
Cheer up! You have to sing!

1007
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:17,100
I've lost my voice,
but you'll see how I sing tomorrow!

1008
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,340
Mummy's little darling!
Mummy's little darling!

1009
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,820
We made it.

1010
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:55,340
It's the voice
of Commendatore Blasetti!

1011
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,020
I'm going to faint!

1012
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:00,060
Madam!

1013
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,660
Good morning!

1014
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,140
Maybe it's my child's turn!

1015
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,900
- Will you let us hear him?
- What does that woman want?

1016
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,060
- Madam, please.
- If you say so...

1017
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:53,020
Come over here a minute.
I have to tell you something.

1018
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,140
- I'm leaving.
- Good!

1019
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:17,580
- All the gifts, the presents...
- All taken care of!

1020
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:21,100
- Did you send the flowers?
- To Blasetti's wife, of course.

1021
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,580
It's important, you see...

1022
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,020
- Did you send the perfume?
- To the cameraman.

1023
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,660
To the cameraman's wife, sure!
Cigarettes to the cameraman.

1024
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,180
Right!

1025
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,420
Did you send a big bunch of flowers?

1026
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,380
Instead of a bunch of normal flowers,
I sent orchids.

1027
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,540
They cost more
but are more impressive.

1028
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,740
You'll see that the gifts work!

1029
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,140
I'm nervous,
I don't care about anything!

1030
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,180
My heart is in my mouth.
My hands are shaking!

1031
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,220
- I hope you won't faint!
- No, I won't faint like her!

1032
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:55,060
She was a fanatic who...
Who's this?

1033
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,220
- With that funny hairstyle.
- That's Mimmetta!

1034
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,820
How are you?

1035
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,620
What a rogue you are!

1036
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:09,940
- Did you buy yourself a scooter?
- Yes, I did!

1037
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,980
When are we inaugurating it?

1038
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,540
With a solemn launching,
a bottle of champagne

1039
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,380
and maybe even a patroness!

1040
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,740
I don't enjoy ceremonies!

1041
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,780
I may get a part
in Colamorucci's next film.

1042
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,380
Glori promised it to me.

1043
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,940
Good for you! Congratulations!

1044
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,500
So in the end, it's you
who have to thank me, right?

1045
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,740
Right!

1046
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,220
Mummy, I've finished!

1047
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:46,100
You've finished? How did it go?

1048
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:47,980
- Very well!
- Tell me about it!

1049
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,740
Mr. Annovazzi, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

1050
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,700
- May I go for a minute?
- I don't think that...

1051
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,500
It's my daughter's turn!

1052
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:21,620
How discourteous!
This isn't at all correct!

1053
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,140
That's her!

1054
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:27,780
That's her. How pretty she is!

1055
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,340
Look how that dress
suits her so well.

1056
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,020
She looks like a hen!

1057
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,220
Mummy's sweetheart!

1058
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:47,220
- What's he saying to her?
- Blasetti's telling her what to do.

1059
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:52,220
- Oh! She has to eat the cake?
- No, they're lighting the candles

1060
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:54,980
and she has to blow them out
as if it were her birthday.

1061
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,860
- And she doesn't get to eat it?
- No!

1062
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,860
What a pity! She'd have done it
well since she loves sweet things!

1063
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:03,420
What's he doing, picking her up?

1064
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,540
She's cute!

1065
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,420
He kissed her!

1066
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,380
He kissed my child, see that?

1067
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,020
Everything's fine. I'm sure of it.

1068
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:22,340
Come to lunch at my
mother-in-law's restaurant on Sunday.

1069
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,500
- I will.
- Bring that young lady with you...

1070
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:29,020
- Mimmetta!
- Yes, the one wearing trousers...

1071
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,780
Your fiancée, I mean.

1072
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:35,340
You should have seen her!
She was phenomenal!

1073
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:38,340
Under those lamps!
All the spotlights on her!

1074
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,100
It was like being in Piazza Navona

1075
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,900
with Commendatore Blasetti
who overawes me!

1076
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:48,260
I couldn't watch him...
She was quiet, confident and calm!

1077
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,380
The child was very calm.

1078
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:54,140
While she was so nervous,
as if it was she auditioning.

1079
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,340
- Don't say such silly things!
- You were trembling all over!

1080
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,660
All right, just a little.
My child's future is at stake.

1081
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,140
It's understandable, isn't it?

1082
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:07,820
Your medicine! I forget everything!
My head is in a spin.

1083
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,500
You must take this medicine

1084
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,780
because in a few days
you have to start working so hard

1085
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,260
that if you don't get a boost...
What is it? Glycerophosphate of...

1086
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,620
- Sodium!
- It'll do you so much good!

1087
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,980
I don't want it! It tastes nasty!
I don't want it! It tastes nasty!

1088
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,700
If you don't take it, I will!

1089
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,780
I'm going to take it myself!

1090
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,020
And you know what will happen?

1091
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,780
The little girls who don't take it
turn into geese!

1092
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,220
Tomorrow morning, you'll wake up:
quack, quack, quack!

1093
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:40,060
Come on! Take it!
It tastes like water! Quack quack!

1094
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,620
- Look, I'll take it.
- You see?

1095
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,060
Did you have to bring here
this chancer?

1096
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,860
You're always complaining!
What's it to do with the chancer?

1097
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:09,940
You're never happy if you're not
fighting with someone, are you?

1098
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,500
You should try
to sweeten your character.

1099
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,580
You know why I bought him here,
because he helped me!

1100
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:18,540
Don't pretend not to understand.
He helped my daughter!

1101
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,900
- Here's the fruit!
- Thank you.

1102
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,420
Up with Roma!

1103
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:28,780
Are you a Roma team fan now?
Oh, Lord! Get out of here!

1104
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:32,900
I want him to meet Spartaco, so
Spartaco can tell you if it's true!

1105
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,900
- Mrs. Maddalena!
- What?

1106
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,340
At least you'll believe him,
you never believe me!

1107
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:40,980
- Come down to the river!
- Are you mad?

1108
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,340
- You'll see how cool it is there!
- He's mad!

1109
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:48,340
I can't come
because I'm in high heels.

1110
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,860
Don't worry about your heels.
I'll give you a hand!

1111
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:54,740
- Take my advice, come on up!
- You come down!

1112
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,820
What a pain! I'm coming!
I'm in heels, it'll be tough!

1113
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,420
- I'll give you a hand!
- Thank goodness for that!

1114
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,860
Be careful you don't hurt yourself.
I'm coming!

1115
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,340
- You make me fall.
- Here you are.

1116
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:15,340
You're crazy to make me come down
in these heels!

1117
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,500
- Can't you feel the breeze?
- It's terribly hot, here.

1118
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,900
- The breeze is cooler!
- Don't let me fall!

1119
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:27,620
- What lovely greenery!
- Where's the greenery?

1120
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:33,020
- I mean nature!
- We're so used to it!

1121
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,220
Then why do you stay
indoors all the time?

1122
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:39,020
It's nice walking here!
It's shady and cool!

1123
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:42,900
It's shady and cool!
There's a refuse dump here!

1124
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:48,860
We're hiding like quails.
Don't push me down! No tricks!

1125
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:54,660
- What... Oh, Lord!
- Don't hit me, or you'll fall!

1126
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,580
Let me take off my shoe
which is full of sand.

1127
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,220
Don't push me down there
or I'll take you with me!

1128
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:03,340
- No! Otherwise I'll fall too!
- I'll drag you down with me!

1129
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:10,020
Let me take my shoe off.
Heavens! It's full! Look!

1130
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,140
- Look at all this!
- Nice earth!

1131
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:16,220
- I must wash my feet! Hold me!
- I'll hold you!

1132
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:19,060
Oh! It's so cold!

1133
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:24,340
Oh, Lord!
My digestion has stopped.

1134
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,900
It's really nice here!

1135
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,220
- It's almost nicer than the Naviglio!
- This man is nuts!

1136
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:32,220
- You did the right thing coming!
- What a mess!

1137
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,340
- I really needed it!
- What?

1138
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,540
- 10 minutes alone with you.
- Really? Why?

1139
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:43,060
Did you want to thank me
for the gift I gave you?

1140
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:47,340
- What are you talking about?
- What's it like? Does it run well?

1141
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,380
How fast can it go?

1142
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:54,660
- I'm not following you!
- Oh, poor fellow!

1143
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,980
May I give you some advice?
You'd take care of it.

1144
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,820
You need to get a cover for it
so it won't get wet!

1145
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,940
If you ruin it, you won't find another
chump like me to buy you another one.

1146
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,820
You can't be thinking that I...

1147
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:16,820
- Not me! I wouldn't dream of it!
- Really!

1148
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:21,620
What do I care!
I understood perfectly.

1149
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:24,860
I was interested in getting
what I wanted.

1150
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:29,220
Comb your hair, you look dishevelled!

1151
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:34,100
- You're fun to be with!
- I know, everyone says that!

1152
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,340
No one can resist my cheerfulness!

1153
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,220
So... don't be cruel.

1154
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,500
I'm very kind. I'm kindness itself!

1155
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:45,300
And I'm obedient!

1156
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,980
It's so pleasant here!
A nice lunch, sunshine, all I need...

1157
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,940
It's a girl, I know. I invited her,
but you didn't bring her!

1158
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:57,340
- Mimmetta? She's not my girl!
- Really?

1159
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:02,100
We dated for a while and we may
get back together, but not now...

1160
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:06,940
- Did you break up?
- Me? I never broke up from anyone!

1161
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,700
- And if I said it was your fault?
- Sure!

1162
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:15,580
- Where do I come into it?
- You do!

1163
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,100
If you want to talk seriously,
we'll talk seriously,

1164
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,420
if you want to joke...
I saw her with you twice...

1165
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,140
- Right!
- Is she jealous?

1166
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,300
Of me? Pull the other one!

1167
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:33,700
A pretty girl like her!

1168
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,020
Do you think a girl
can't be jealous of you?

1169
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,660
I'm not saying that, but...

1170
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:45,820
- Did your husband never tell you...
- Of course he told me, and how!

1171
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,740
Let's hope they win!

1172
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:51,500
- The Lazio team?
- Roma! Let's not fight!

1173
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,220
- Very well, very well!
- Roma will win!

1174
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,540
As you wish!

1175
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,780
That's more like it!
Let me hear what they're saying.

1176
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,980
I can't make out anything
from down here, dammit!

1177
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:06,180
- This is the way to go.
- No, that's not proper!

1178
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,900
- Stay still! Stop that!
- Who, me?

1179
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,900
- Look what a shrewd face!
- Let's be honest!

1180
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:16,060
- Let's be honest!
- I fixed things for your child.

1181
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,780
That cost me my girlfriend!

1182
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:22,180
You bought the scooter!
What more do you want?

1183
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,380
Don't make me say what I think!

1184
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,500
Lord, how cunning he is!

1185
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,300
What a son of a...

1186
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:41,500
- I got the scooter!
- You deserve...

1187
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:44,340
Life's great, isn't it?

1188
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,780
Sure! Life is great.

1189
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,740
It would be great,

1190
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:53,220
but you only live it once,
quite briefly and quite badly.

1191
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:57,660
I know you love your husband
and you feel good.

1192
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,900
You're happy when you're with him
and your daughter.

1193
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,180
But...

1194
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:06,740
Today, at this moment,

1195
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,260
we're happy here together.

1196
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,500
Why shouldn't I say so?

1197
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,700
It's true.

1198
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,860
And we're on the same wavelength.
It's nice being here.

1199
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,700
I feel a great urge to hug you.

1200
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,060
Is there anything wrong
in saying so?

1201
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,620
No.

1202
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:33,220
My mother,
who's a little old lady now,

1203
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:37,700
if as a young woman
she'd let someone hug her,

1204
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,620
like this, in the sunshine,
on the riverbank,

1205
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,580
instead of torturing herself
thinking

1206
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,500
what my life would be like
when I grew up,

1207
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,900
today she might be less sad

1208
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:56,140
seeing the days go by
while washing my four shirts.

1209
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:59,380
My mother...

1210
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:04,780
All the things she gave up
she turned into hopes for me.

1211
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,500
Poor thing!

1212
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:13,060
And now, like Mimmetta,
she says to me all day:

1213
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:16,780
"Be a go-getter. Be a go-getter!".

1214
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,500
I am a go-getter.

1215
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:22,900
You know that very well!

1216
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:26,700
I never pass up any opportunity
that comes my way.

1217
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,420
I don't get my hopes up.

1218
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,260
But I don't want to have
any regrets.

1219
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,660
Am I right, Maddalena?

1220
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:41,620
Don't make me finish up my Sunday
counting the ants in the sand!

1221
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,620
Maddalena, listen...

1222
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:49,340
Have you ever tried
letting yourself go?

1223
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:54,980
Doing one of those silly things
people do just like that,

1224
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,060
once in a while,
without thinking about it much,

1225
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:02,220
without mulling it over, like
the rich, when they squander money?

1226
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,860
They're the most fun things,

1227
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,980
they brighten up our lives.

1228
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:10,820
They're everything.

1229
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,860
Right now, in this light,
your eyes are blue.

1230
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,580
No, they're green, like the water.

1231
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,100
They change, it's the reflection.

1232
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,620
And now they're very pale
and seem to be laughing.

1233
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:45,820
Come on! Don't talk nonsense!

1234
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,980
Look... I'm all dirty!

1235
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,980
- Why did you stand up?
- Because I have to go!

1236
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,100
Do you want to stay here
counting the ants?

1237
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,220
Stay, if that pleases you!

1238
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:10,020
Shall I send you my mother-in-law?
She can help you a little, no?

1239
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,260
Let's go.

1240
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:14,260
What? Aren't you coming?

1241
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:18,900
To do want to have a swim,
to cool your hot head?

1242
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:26,180
Let's go and watch the auditions.
Come on! Get moving!

1243
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,940
Poor tousled fellow,
you were unlucky. No matter!

1244
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,140
You'll be luckier another time!

1245
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,220
Oh, my jacket! Excuse me.

1246
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:02,020
If you want to see the screen test,
come to the Cinecittà editing room

1247
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,060
and ask for Iris.

1248
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,820
- Thanks so much.
- Goodbye.

1249
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,820
Goodbye, everyone!

1250
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,820
Did you take off only your shoes?

1251
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,540
May I? Is Iris here?

1252
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,820
I'm Iris! Come in!

1253
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,620
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, do come in!

1254
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:04,300
Mr. Annovazzi told me to come to you.

1255
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,700
He mentioned that!
I was expecting you!

1256
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:10,420
He said you have the auditions.
Of all the little girls.

1257
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:13,140
- Do you have my daughter's too?
- Which one is she?

1258
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,100
- This one here.
- Number 7! It's in the can!

1259
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:20,540
- What do you mean?
- To take it to the viewing room.

1260
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,820
The film! I see!

1261
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:26,740
- May I watch it? Is it this one?
- No, this is a different test.

1262
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,260
- Ah, it's another little girl!
- Right.

1263
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:32,260
But it's not very clear.

1264
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,860
She seems like a cat!

1265
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,180
She gives me the shivers!

1266
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,660
- May I see my daughter's?
- No!

1267
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,100
Blasetti is waiting for me
in the viewing room.

1268
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:49,260
Iris, hurry and bring the tests
down as Blasetti is waiting!

1269
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,060
- I'm coming!
- He's angry!

1270
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:54,700
- They are in room n.3.
- Fine, bye!

1271
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:58,060
- Are they viewing the tests?
- Yes, they are!

1272
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,420
- Including my daughter's?
- Yes!

1273
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:03,660
- Please show it to me!
- Believe me, I can't!

1274
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:06,540
- I came all the way here!
- They'll tell me off!

1275
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:09,740
- But who'll see me?
- Nella, you try telling her!

1276
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,700
- Try to understand...
- It's just impossible!

1277
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:17,740
Where did I see you? I saw you!

1278
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:20,940
Where did I see you? Help me!

1279
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:22,860
Tell her! Are you ashamed?

1280
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:26,540
- You'll have seen me in a film!
- It's true!

1281
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:30,780
That really nice Roman film,
"Under the Roman Sun".

1282
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,660
How lovely that film was!

1283
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:36,780
Was it you who got slapped?
How I enjoyed it!

1284
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:40,180
Do you remember it?
You loved it!

1285
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:45,580
- Are you in the film with my girl?
- No, I don't make films any more.

1286
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:48,540
I work here. I do editing.

1287
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:51,260
You're no longer in films... Why?

1288
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,620
I'm not an actress.

1289
01:32:55,380 --> 01:33:00,140
They hired me once or twice,
as I was the type they needed.

1290
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,660
I even got my hopes up

1291
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,980
and it cost me my job
and the fiancé I had then.

1292
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:11,100
You need to be real,
professional actors

1293
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,780
or give up your dreams
and have a job to turn to.

1294
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:18,180
I'm sorry to say that.
You're getting your hopes up.

1295
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,340
You may well be right.

1296
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,180
I doubt it, though.

1297
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:26,540
So many people ended up badly
thinking they'd make it in films.

1298
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:30,060
I'd convinced myself
I was very good and very beautiful.

1299
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:32,860
Yet, here I am, editing films,

1300
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,980
no one called me any more.

1301
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:39,980
Really?

1302
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,780
Poor thing.

1303
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,300
It can't be the same for everyone.

1304
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:54,060
That would be terrible.

1305
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,940
That would be really terrible.

1306
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:02,340
With no solution.

1307
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:07,140
I'm staking everything on her.

1308
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:12,420
I'd be disappointed!

1309
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,260
Don't worry, Madam,

1310
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,900
everything will work out.
She's so pretty.

1311
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,100
- Have you seen her screen test?
- Yes, I have.

1312
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,740
- Is she cute?
- Yes, very.

1313
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:30,740
- Show it to me.
- How can I?

1314
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:35,940
How can I? Nella! What do you say?
Shall I send it up for viewing?

1315
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,700
Why not, give it a try!

1316
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:40,780
No one will see me.
I'll stand behind you.

1317
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,300
You're so kind.

1318
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,820
I'll take you there,
provided you stay quiet!

1319
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:51,180
I won't say a word! I won't move!

1320
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,340
Thank you!

1321
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,300
There is my daughter.

1322
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:07,540
Please, let me see my daughter.
Thanks.

1323
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,940
You see her? The girl who was
at the photographer's! Remember?

1324
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,260
- Do you see her?
- Yes, I saw her.

1325
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,740
Quiet, or they'll throw us out!

1326
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,260
- What's this one's name?
- This is Maria Cecconi.

1327
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:36,620
That's you!

1328
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,220
How small you look from afar!

1329
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:50,420
What are you doing?
Now you have to put out the candles.

1330
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,020
Blow, blow!

1331
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,620
Poor thing!

1332
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:15,620
Couldn't you manage?

1333
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,980
You've so much breath at home,
but not here?

1334
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,860
My goodness, you make me feel ill!

1335
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:32,660
Guys! Please!

1336
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,180
It's really incredible!

1337
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:38,860
Laugh, laugh... You too...

1338
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:43,900
- Who brought her, Glori?
- Not me! Maybe him, Annovazzi.

1339
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:46,100
Did you bring her?

1340
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:50,660
I only directed her here,
because her mother asked me...

1341
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:55,780
Now, you say the poem.
I know you can recite it well.

1342
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,580
You burst into tears?

1343
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,900
Why did you burst into tears?

1344
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:30,340
They're amused, can't you hear?

1345
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:33,060
Perhaps you made them laugh!

1346
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,740
What do they have to laugh at?

1347
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,100
What are they saying?

1348
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,260
Are they talking badly of her?

1349
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:16,380
Why are they so amused?

1350
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,380
Why? What's so funny?

1351
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:30,020
She's a dwarf, look!

1352
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:37,860
Swines!

1353
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,340
Swines! I can't take this!

1354
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,820
I can't take it, I can't stand it.

1355
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,380
Aren't you overdoing it?

1356
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:51,340
Stop the film
and restart it from the beginning!

1357
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:55,620
- What's so laughable?
- She's funny with that fringe!

1358
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:59,140
She's not a child, she's a dwarf!
In '25 she was at school with me!

1359
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:01,260
Are you insinuating
you're 30 years old?

1360
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,340
- Fine. What do you think?
- It's a counterproductive test.

1361
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:11,940
Sorry if I express my opinion,
but I think it's a waste of film.

1362
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:16,820
I realized immediately that
the girl would come out like that.

1363
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:19,020
I believe I already told you...

1364
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,740
Your name's Annovazzi, isn't it?

1365
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,780
Have you served in the army?
Stand up!

1366
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:30,660
Good! By the left!
By the left! Quick march!

1367
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:33,140
Glori, get rid of him!
Go away!

1368
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:34,780
Sorry, Blasetti!

1369
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:39,580
Carry on like this and you're out.
I won't be able to hire you.

1370
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:42,500
- You've no chance.
- At least let me apologize.

1371
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:43,900
You'll make it worse!

1372
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:48,780
Is it fair that I lose my job
over this?

1373
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,980
Let me explain,
I'll apologize to him!

1374
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:53,180
- You'll make it worse.
- What do you mean?

1375
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:58,700
I was right, we've wasted
time, money and film!

1376
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:01,860
Time, money, film and our health!

1377
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:06,540
We work hard for two weeks
to find this little girl

1378
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,700
and then you tell us
we've wasted money.

1379
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:12,420
Filippo, please!
You've laughed up till now!

1380
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:15,220
Go and see what's happening there?

1381
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:19,340
No, let me through!

1382
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
- You can't come in.
- Leave me alone!

1383
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:25,180
- Don't you dare touch me!
- Madam, calm down...

1384
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:27,940
- Can't I talk to the director?
- What do you want to say to him?

1385
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:30,500
What was so funny in this little girl?

1386
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:33,140
Is she so funny?
Where is he? There he is!

1387
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:35,420
- Mr. Blasetti...
- Later!

1388
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:38,140
Let me through! Let me through!

1389
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,140
Excuse me, Mr. Blasetti...

1390
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,380
I was hiding up there in the booth...

1391
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:47,380
I heard you all laughing.
What made you laugh so much?

1392
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,500
Do you find this little girl
so laughable?

1393
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,940
Look at her!
She's just like all the others!

1394
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:55,220
- One of you called her a dwarf!
- No, no!

1395
01:40:55,380 --> 01:41:00,020
How rude! You've no respect
for other people's feelings!

1396
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:02,940
You've no respect
for sacrifices people make!

1397
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:06,940
I made so many sacrifices
to buy her this dress...

1398
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:10,580
- All these sacrifices...
- Don't worry, Madam.

1399
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:14,500
And Mr. Annovazzi...
Where is Mr. Annovazzi?

1400
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:17,020
- We kicked him out.
- You did the right thing!

1401
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:20,140
You're a person who understands.
You did the right thing!

1402
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:27,060
How can we tell if someone
is hiding in the projection booth?

1403
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:30,060
Mr. Blasetti, I beg you,

1404
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:34,980
don't send me away like this,
without a glimmer of hope.

1405
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:37,700
You see? This is the cinema.

1406
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:41,260
We're responsible for all this.
Glori, come here!

1407
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:44,580
We can't deal
with the mothers too!

1408
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:48,100
- Put reel n.7 back on.
- The one with Maria Cecconi!

1409
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:51,580
I want to see the test again.
Do you want to go to Doney's?

1410
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,100
- No, I'm going to watch it again.
- I'm pleased. It's such fun!

1411
01:41:56,180 --> 01:41:58,420
The dwarf in the land of the giants...

1412
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:03,340
Remember I'm from Milan,
I don't have lunch at Doney's!

1413
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:07,220
- Do you go to Motta?
- No, I have lunch in the office.

1414
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,940
"Today, tomorrow and never".
Seventh screen test.

1415
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:22,020
Annovazzi! Alberto!
Wait for me! Stop!

1416
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:25,780
You must immediately find the child
who did the screen test!

1417
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:28,140
The one that made us laugh,
what's her name?

1418
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,420
- Cecconi?
- Right, Blasetti wants her!

1419
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:35,060
Blasetti kicked me out,
it's no longer my business!

1420
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:40,020
Don't be stupid! Don't be a fool!
You have to find that child!

1421
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:44,420
You find her! Here's her address:
via Alberto da Giussano, 4. Bye!

1422
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:47,580
If you find her for me
and we sign the contract tonight,

1423
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:49,820
I promise you'll be in the film!

1424
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,340
- Swear on it!
- I swear. I give you my word!

1425
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,980
She lives in Prenestino,
via Alberto da Giussano, 4.

1426
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,220
I'll go ahead by scooter,
you join me by car!

1427
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:03,540
All right. Orsini, move it!

1428
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:06,060
The contract is ready
and signed by the producer.

1429
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:08,860
All we need is your approval.
We have the best actors!

1430
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:10,500
- There's...
- Amedeo Nazzari.

1431
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,820
- And that American actress...
- Lana Turner!

1432
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:15,500
- If not her, a better one!
- That's what I said!

1433
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:20,620
Maybe while we're talking to him
he's worried about his wife.

1434
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:23,140
Don't worry, she'll be back.
She's not a child.

1435
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:27,860
I'll take care of that!
We and the police are very close.

1436
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:32,220
Orsini, go straight to talk
to Superintendent Giusillo.

1437
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:37,660
Tell him Glori sent you
and that I need a favour.

1438
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:42,020
- Forget about the police.
- He's right. Forget about it!

1439
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:45,780
My wife will be here soon!
She wanted to do her own thing!

1440
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,940
I'd really like to know
where she got to!

1441
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:51,100
I even asked someone
to let me know when she arrives.

1442
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:54,340
- Do have a seat.
- Orsini, you can go.

1443
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:56,940
- We can discuss the contract!
- Fine.

1444
01:46:58,060 --> 01:46:59,180
So...

1445
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:02,740
With this private agreement,
we are hiring the child...

1446
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:04,180
Maria Cecconi!

1447
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,420
As the leading juvenile player.

1448
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:11,260
Mr. Spartaco! She's here!
Come on up! She's here!

1449
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:19,100
At last, you got it!

1450
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:23,300
Stay still! Don't touch her!

1451
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,860
Don't touch her!

1452
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,140
Maddalena!

1453
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:31,340
Spartaco, don't wake the child up!

1454
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:34,300
Don't wake her up.

1455
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,300
Will you let me through?

1456
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,180
Thank goodness she's arrived!

1457
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:49,540
Her eyes are red, she's been crying.

1458
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,900
Maddalena! What's the matter?

1459
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,660
- You got what you wanted!
- Well...

1460
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:02,420
For once you're successful,
and you start crying!

1461
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:04,780
Let's sign this contract!

1462
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:07,260
Otherwise, we're done for.

1463
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:10,820
Either we sign the contract,
or we all sleep in the street.

1464
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:13,740
She's crying!

1465
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:16,860
Here she is, our Greta Garbo!

1466
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:20,380
Don't touch her!

1467
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:22,780
Don't touch her!

1468
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:27,740
Madam, let's sign the contract!
We just need one signature!

1469
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:30,420
I'll give you 250,000 lire now!

1470
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:33,780
A further 250,000 in a week,
and more in 15 days.

1471
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:37,020
I'll give you the first instalment
straight away.

1472
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,980
Where's the cheque book?
Do you have it, Alberto? No.

1473
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:42,780
It must be at Cinecittà.
I'll be right back to pay you!

1474
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:45,620
It's two million lire!
You're going to get two million!

1475
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:49,740
Plus a thousand lire a day
with the lunch and other things.

1476
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:54,380
Don't turn your back on luck,
it only comes round once!

1477
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,740
Do me a favour and sign it!

1478
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:00,260
Very well...

1479
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:06,020
How do you want the child?
With curly hair or straight?

1480
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:08,260
Is she to lisp? Is she to stutter?

1481
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,020
What makes you laugh most?

1482
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:13,980
Haven't you all had enough fun?

1483
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:18,940
I'm really sorry,
but my daughter's staying put!

1484
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:22,740
I didn't bring her into the world
to amuse anyone.

1485
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:26,620
For me and her father,
she's very pretty!

1486
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,980
She's very pretty!

1487
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,100
We're keeping her here!

1488
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,740
Go now, or you'll wake her up.

1489
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,340
Leave us alone.

1490
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:52,020
Spartaco, what are you waiting for
to tell these gentlemen

1491
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:54,580
that your daughter
will never be in films?

1492
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,300
Kick them out!

1493
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:00,020
Kick them out, Spartaco!

1494
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:02,900
Kick them out, kick them out...

1495
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,220
Can you hear me?

1496
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:15,300
I fear there's nothing we can do.
I know her well.

1497
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:20,100
Take back the contract,
return to Cinecittà. I'm sorry.

1498
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:23,300
What are you doing here?
You're always a nuisance!

1499
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:26,420
Get that!
We're always a nuisance?

1500
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:29,940
What about you
and the racket you make?

1501
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:33,500
I'm the concierge. Haven't I
the right to tell these ladies

1502
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:37,020
what goes on in the house
where I work as a concierge?

1503
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:41,500
Be quiet!
My daughter's sleeping!

1504
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:46,660
Be quiet! Do me the favour
of taking all these whales away!

1505
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:52,180
Quiet! My daughter is asleep!

1506
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:54,220
Go away!

1507
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:57,140
What are you doing here?
Out! Come on! Move!

1508
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:00,260
You must stop it
or I'll send you my husband.

1509
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,940
Send us your grandfather
and your uncle! Go away!

1510
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:04,380
What a harridan!

1511
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:12,860
How will I look in front
of the producer, of everyone?

1512
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:16,340
Orsini's already driven off.

1513
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:19,700
- How do I get back to Cinecittà?
- I'll take you on my scooter.

1514
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:29,900
Well, let's go!

1515
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,500
- Good evening. I mean goodbye!
- Good evening.

1516
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,900
That infernal cinema!
Always disturbing us!

1517
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,100
My poor little house...

1518
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:19,020
My poor little house,
where did you go?

1519
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,500
Give me four slaps!

1520
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,500
Give them to me
and you'll feel better. Hurry!

1521
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:16,260
What are you waiting for, Spartaco?

1522
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,820
This crazy wife of mine!

1523
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:55,380
Don't worry about the house.

1524
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:59,020
Don't you worry, I'll see to it.
I'll pay for everything.

1525
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:01,820
Even if I have to kill myself working.

1526
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:05,140
Even if I have to get all of Rome
to come down with diabetes!

1527
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:08,820
Don't worry, Spartaco. Don't worry.

1528
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,780
- Can you hear him?
- Who?

1529
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:18,900
Burt Lancaster... What a nice man!

1530
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,420
Maddalena, now I'll beat you for real!

1531
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:24,060
Can't you even take a joke?

1532
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:35,780
Quiet, don't talk,
don't wake the child up!

1533
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:38,260
Don't wake the child up!

4
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,782
<i>Eunuchs have seized power
in the palace.</i>

5
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:17,078
<i>They also control
two powerful espionage agencies:</i>

6
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:20,582

and the Imperial Guards.</i>

7
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,083
<i>These are the Imperial Guards.</i>

8
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,754
<i>These are agents of the Eastern Depot,
a kind of secret police.</i>

9
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:30,091
<i>These agents and guards are ruthless.</i>

10
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:33,052

11
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:35,221

12
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:38,892

14

15

16
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:53,990
<i>He's a master swordsman
and wields great power.</i>

17
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:57,535
<i>He's unsurpassed in the martial arts.</i>

18
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,122
<i>High government officials
all tremble in fear</i>

19
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,541

20
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,762

23

<i>YU was framed
by treacherous and powerful eunuchs</i>

24
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,778
<i>and sentenced to death
for conspiring with foreigners,</i>

25

Your Excellency is most insightful.

I say rip the weeds out by the roots!

51
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,808

54
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,268
Stop!

55
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,151
Step aside!

56
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,700
Beat it!

57
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,161
Officer, take them away.

- Hurry!

59

Your Excellency.

60

What is it?

61
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,209
Someone intervened?
.

62
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,087
They can't get far.
We can overtake them.

63
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,969
No, wait for them at Dragon Gate.

64
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,670
- Look.
- What?
.

65
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,630
Just look!

66
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,757
Go tell the boss.

67
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,468
- Boss!
- What's all the commotion?
.

68
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,887
We have guests. Look.

69
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,309
Go help with their things.

70
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:46,647
Leaving now? Come back soon
..

71
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,987
How strange!
Guests at this time of year?
.

72
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,991
You must be tired.
Let us take your things.

73
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,162
You've had a hard journey.
Please come inside.

74
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,956
This way.

75
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:13,382
Draw water for washing,
and prepare tea.

76
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,262
I’m sure you're all very tired.
Please sit down.

77
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:23,768
Have some tea.
Pour tea for our guests.

78
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,603
Have some tea.

79
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:30,274
Would you like a room upstairs?
.

80
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,195
Please sit down.

81
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,614
Make some tea.

82
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,700
Right here is fine.

83
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,762
Where's the innkeeper?
.

84
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:03,724
He's away. I’ll be happy to help.

85
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,355
What do you do here?
.

86
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,315
I’m the bookkeeper.

87
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,073
How many guests are staying here now?
.

88
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,784
This time of year? None
..

89
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,248
- Good. We'll take the entire inn.
- The entire inn?

90
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,211
We'll probably stay five to ten days.

91
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:37,299
You're to accept no other guests
while we're here, understand?

92
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,385
Yes, but -

93
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,099
- Go arrange rooms for the men.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:48,227
A gratuity for our trouble sir?
,.

95
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,650
- Wait over there.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,009
I’ll get you some fresh tea.

97
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,969
Waiter!

98
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,806
Bring some fresh tea.

99
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,153
- How much?
- Whatever you think, sir.

100
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,656
The luggage was heavy,
and we lugged it for miles.

101
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,992
I see.

102
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,550
How many soldiers are stationed nearby?
.

103
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,718
- I’m not sure.
- Out with it!

104
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,054
About twelve.

105
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:57,064
You there... go handle it.

106
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:10,494
We need this place
for a little business.

107
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:14,915
If other guests arrive,
you consult with me first.

108
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:17,334
Understand bookkeeper?
,.

109
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,128
Yes, sir.

110
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,968
Give them a good burial,

111
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,262
and bring me a nice pot of tea.

112
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,357
I’ll wait for them on the road.

113
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:25,486
Take some men into the woods.
We'll meet down below.

114
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:28,822
And leave a few men to guard the inn.

115
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,137
We have no rooms, sir.

116
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,764
- I won't be staying.
- And you are?
....

117
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,058
Is the innkeeper Mr Wu here?
,.,.

118
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,060
He's away on business.

119
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,062
When will he be back?
.

120
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,897
I don't exactly know.

121
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,735
Perhaps you could come back
in a few days.

122
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,237
No, I’ll wait.

123
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,493
I’d leave now if I were you.

124
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,911
Why?
.

125
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,581
Because -

126
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,083
Because...

127
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,878
the thing is...

128
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,048
this area isn't safe right now.

129
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,176
Because of the Tartar soldiers?
.

130
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,469
Exactly!

131
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,722
That's all right.
I’m not afraid of them.

132
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,687
Why did you stop playing?
.

133
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,612
Besides, the inn is full. You'd best -

134
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:35,073
He just told me that.
Any lodgings will do.

135
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,243
Bring me
some mutton noodles and wine.

136
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,997
You...

137
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,127
Bring mutton noodles and wine.

138
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,880
Waiter...

139
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:16,592
I’d like a bowl of mutton noodles too.

140
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,721
I want the bowl
on that gentleman's table.

141
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,932
That bowl there.

142
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,734
Sir, I’ll bring you another bowl.

143
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,485
Hold it!

144
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,490
I want that bowl Understand?
..

145
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,953
Yes, I understand, but...

146
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,415
The gentleman can have this bowl.

147
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,083
Thank you.

148
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,341
Here!

149
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,474
Please.

150
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,152
Waiter, don't just stand there.

151
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,655
Go see if my wine's ready.

152
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,239
Take it to him.

153
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,492
Take it to him!

154
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,552
Sir, your wine is -

155
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,220
What about it?
.

156
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,977
Your wine is -

157
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,117
No, don't!

158
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,046
What's wrong?
.

159
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,007
Your wine spilled.

160
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,930
I’m sorry.

161
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,198
What's going on?
What's the matter with you?
.

162
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,191
You!

163
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,943
It wasn't me!

164
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,198
- What's going on?
.
- I have no idea.

165
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,143
Sit down.

166
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:39,020
Bet this for me.

167
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:43,859
Get some rope to tie him up
and take him away.

168
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,944
Move it!

169
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,156

- You put something in my wine!
- I didn't!

171
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,926
- No? Then you drink it
..
- No!

172
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,012
You have no choice!

173
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,230
Get back!

174
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,611
You blind dogs!

175
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:33,783
You've got some nerve!
Don't you know who I am?
.

176
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,383
Waiter, another pot of wine.

Let me use your towel.

179
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,900
I’m talking to you! You hear me?
.

180
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,736
Pick those things up.

181
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,044
Don't just stand there!

182
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,908
Bring me my wine.

183
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,751
- What happened?
.
- Hold it!

184
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,463
Don't forget your tools of the trade.

185
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,566
One step closer and you're dead!

186
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,835
Oh dear!

187
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,339
- Bring me another bowl of noodles.
- You still want to eat?
.

188
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,174
Do as you're told!

189
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,303
Now you've done it, sir!
- How so?

190
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,681
There are dozens of them.
They'll be back any minute.

191
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:06,353
Don't worry.
They won't dare return while I’m here.

192
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,862
- I’ll go look into it, sir.
- Wait.

193
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,866
This fellow's clearly up to no good.
Be careful.

194
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,195
Did you kill that man?
.

195
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,447
Why?
.

196
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,615
- Didn't he tell you?
.
- He did.

197
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,576
Then you needn't ask me.

198
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:48,413
I heard one side of the story.
I want to hear yours.

199
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,415
What are you to him?
.

200
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,542
I’m his friend.

201
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,630
Seeing as you're his friend, I’ll tell you.

202
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,970
He poisoned my wine!

203
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,265
You killed him for that?
.

204
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:11,144
What proof do you have that he did it?
.

205
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,813
My word is proof enough.

206
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:20,612
A man's life is involved.
How should we resolve this?
.

207
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,322
What do you think?
.

208
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,867
A debt for a debt, a life for a life.

209
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,287
Fine. Report me to county officials.

210
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,956
I have no time for that.

211
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:35,084
And I doubt county officials
could handle me.

212
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,504
That's right.

213
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:41,424
You'd have to explain
how those porters got killed.

214
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,970
- Stop being difficult!
- I thought we'd just forget the whole thing.

215
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,599
Forget the whole thing?
.
It's not that simple.

216
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,019
Why not?
.

217
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,188
You're being unreasonable!

218
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,028
Well?
.

219
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,728
Stay back!

220
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,788
I’ve told you men not to cause trouble
among the people.

221
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,291
But dogs just can't help eating shit!

222
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,921
Sir, this fellow just -

223
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,759
Bring water for washing.

224
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,261
My compliments!

225
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,429
You're too kind.

226
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,306
They're all ignorant fools.

227
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,600
Please forgive them for offending you.

228
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,268
It's quite all right.

229
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:17,937
Might I ask your name?
.

230
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,482
Xiao Shao-zi.

231
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,611
My dear Mr. Xiao...

232
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,408
what is your occupation?.
- Oh, I’m just a loafer.

233
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:35,872
Where there's a free meal,
I stay for a while,

234
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,292
but no job can keep me for long.

235
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,758
If I may be so bold...

236
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,969
what brings you
to these desolate parts?
.

237
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,056
The innkeeper is a friend.

238
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:57,810
And what is your occupation?
.

239
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,317
I work for the
Criminal Investigation Department.

240
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,111
I travel around with these fools.

241
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:10,323
Really? Are you here on a case?
..

242
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,241
I have no choice.

243
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,995
When paid to solve a problem,
one must deliver the goods.

244
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,165
We might need your help someday.

245
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,668
You flatter me.

246
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,337
What case brings you here?
.

247
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,094
I hope you won't take offense...

248
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:34,263
but we can't reveal too much.

249
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,015
I understand.

250
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,018
We're here by secret imperial order.

251
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:43,523
Our instructions say
no outside parties may be present

252
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,025
while we're on this case, so -

253
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,779
I understand.
You're asking me to leave.

254
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:53,116
Never!
But if you wouldn't mind terribly,

255
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,993
I’ll be sure to repay the favor.

256
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,829
That won't be necessary.

257
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:12,468
I’d like to help
with your travel expenses.

258
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,762
I wouldn't hear of it.

259
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,765
But I’ll be back when Mr. Wu returns.

260
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,642
Of course. Thanks very much.

261
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,477
My bill, please.

262
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,396
- It's on the house.
- No, I’ll -

263
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,358
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

264
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,318
Until we meet again.

265
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:34,490
Please return this to that gentleman.

266
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,577
Good-bye.

267
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,547
Have two men tail him.

268
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,255
Brother Wu.

269
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:34,926
Ah, Xiao! You finally made it.

270
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,638
- I was just at your inn.
- Why didn't you wait for me?.

271
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:41,766
Criminal Investigation officers
working on a case there

272
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,227
said I’d be in the way.

273
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,858
They didn't look like officials to me.

274
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,110
They weren't in uniform.

275
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,823
Wait a minute.

276
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,867
Who do you think they are?
.

277
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,620
I don't know,
but they're up to no good.

278
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,997
And every one is a crack swordsman.

279
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,334
What did you want to see me for?
.

280
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,504
Let's get to the inn!

281
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:20,972
Commander, that Xiao fellow's back.

282
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,890
Put everything away.

283
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,310
You're not to call me
"commander" from now on

284
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,689
or to tell anyone
we're with the Eastern Depot.

285
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:33,276
We're with Criminal Investigations.
Go tell the others.

286
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,907
Go tell the sentries outside.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,251
My dear Mr. Xiao.

288
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:55,631
Back so soon?
.
- I met Mr. Wu at the pass.

289
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,758
This is the officer
from Criminal Investigations.

290
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,136
- I’m Wu Ning.
- Nice to meet you.

291
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:04,807
Please forgive me if service
was unsatisfactory in my absence.

292
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:07,393
- No, it's been very good.
- Mr. Wu...

293
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,229
my name is Mao Zong-Xian.

294
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,065
We need your inn for official purposes.

295
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,526
Beyond preparing our food,

296
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:17,904
you're not to interfere
with our business.

297
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:21,490
And until we go,
no one here is to leave.

298
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,326
That includes you.

299
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:27,705
And remember: no other guests
without our permission.

300
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,415
Certainly.

301
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,521
Halt!

302
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,150
What do you want?
.

303
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:49,495
Let's go.

304
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,998
Brother!

305
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,252
Let's just watch where they go.

306
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,020
Let's go have a look.

307
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,561
- What do you want?
.
- A room.

308
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:58,564
Open up!

309
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:02,359
Open this door!

310
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,905
Open up!

311
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,438
There are no rooms. Stop knocking!

312
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,131
Who's the innkeeper here?
.

313
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,050
I am.

314
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,553
I asked politely!
Why didn't you open up?
.

315
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:14,390
Forgive the rude welcome,
but we really have no rooms.

316
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:16,475
Then I’ll sleep right here!

317
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:22,481
- What's this boorish behavior?
.
- Who are you?

318
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,901
- An interested party.
- Mind your own business!

319
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,990
How dare you act like this!

320
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:34,910
Brother, forget it. Listen to me.

321
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:39,165
- Forget it.
- No! I’ll camp right here!

322
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,293
No need to camp anywhere.
Please take my room.

323
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,003
We couldn't do that.

324
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,922
We travelers must help one another.

325
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,133
- Who's that fellow?
.
- Just a merchant.

326
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:50,676
Innkeeper, let's eat!

327
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,015
Excuse me, please.

328
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,188
Dig in, everyone.

329
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,192
- Where are you two headed?
.
- We're going -

330
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,527
To Gansu to visit a relative.

331
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,992
And what is your business here?
.

332
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:20,206
We're government officials
on the tracks of two escaped convicts.

333
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,791
I’m sure that's very difficult work.

334
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,253
Let me toast you all.

335
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:32,343
Have you by any chance seen
some convicts being transferred?
.

336
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:34,720
A man woman and child?
,,.

337
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,148
Yes, we saw several groups, in fact.

338
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:49,360
Do you know their names
and destination?

339
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:53,489
Zhang's the last name.
Distant relatives headed for Tianshou.

340
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,699
I haven't seen them.

341
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,284
What about you?
.

342
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,411
I’ve heard nothing about them.

343
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:02,706
Let's have another drink.

344
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,506
This wine's awful.

345
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:14,385
Go see if there's something better,
and warm up two pots.

346
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,656
They've poisoned the wine.

347
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:53,507
My friend, I was very rude earlier.

348
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,634
I’d like to apologize.

349
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,261
Let's drink together.

350
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:02,057
Fine. We'll put all that behind us.

351
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,727
Cheers!

352
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:08,147
Thanks.

353
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,486
THE WINE IS POISONED

354
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:19,783
- Have a little warm wine.
- Thanks.

355
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,709
Here's to you!

356
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:32,546
What are you doing?
.

357
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,924
- Drunk already?
.
- I haven't had any yet!

358
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,385
Just a little spill. Not to worry.

359
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,346
Let me refill it.

360
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:43,682
Cheers!

361
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,687
What's wrong with you?
.

362
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,106
How about some sesame cakes?
.

363
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:52,983
You really are drunk.

364
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:57,029
You'll get chest pains again.
- When did I ever have chest pains?
.

365
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,615
Mother told me to look after you.

366
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,868
She said you'll get
chest pains if you drink.

367
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:10,834
This is strong stuff.
There's pigeon crap in it.

368
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:16,590
My little brother's always
bossing me around.

369
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:37,736
Since your brother can't drink,
let's you and I share a drink.

370
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:38,904
Sure.

371
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:40,739
Cheers!

372
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,495
You spilled half of yours.
That's not fair.

373
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,997
Drink from my cup. It's full.

374
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:52,918
I spilled mine too.
Let me have yours.

375
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,840
Why fuss young man?
,.
They're all the same.

376
00:45:58,924 --> 00:46:00,092
No, they're not!

377
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,845
Why do you say that?
.

378
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,888
Fill his cup.

379
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,396
I want your cup.

380
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:14,773
What's so special about my cup?
.

381
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,944
Are you trying to start something?
.

382
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,904
Leave me alone, brother.

383
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,449
Just give your cup to Mr. Zhu.

384
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:28,787
I’ll handle it!

385
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:37,296
This isn't how one offers a drink!

386
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,388
You're drunk.

387
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,813
Forgive him. He drinks too much.

388
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:03,071
His little trick nearly cost me my life.

389
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:07,784
Stop displaying your incompetence
and let go!

390
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,068
Commander...

391
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:26,947
I think those Zhu brothers
are somehow connected to YU Qian.

392
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,909
I think Mr. Xiao is the real troublemaker.

393
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:34,246
He let Zhu know
the wine was poisoned.

394
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:35,581
When?
.

395
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,793
- When he came over to offer a toast.
- How?
.

396
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:42,629
I didn't see,
but those four are in cahoots.

397
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,172
Four?
.

398
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,592
Including Wu, the innkeeper.

399
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:50,429
Then just kill them all!

400
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,348
Mr. Xiao will be a challenge.

401
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:00,439
Let's set them against each other.

402
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,234
I don't trust that Xiao fellow.

403
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:07,112
We'd be dead if he hadn't warned us.

404
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,949
But why?
.
He had no reason to save us.

405
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,550
Sleep over there, brother.

406
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,011
On the floor?
.

407
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:39,061
You've got lots of tricks up your sleeve.

408
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,171
You got that?
.

409
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:12,571
- Brother!
- Stay there!

410
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:17,993
I want to explain -
Stop being so unreasonable!

411
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:37,929
A woman?
.

412
00:52:04,623 --> 00:52:07,000
Mr Zhu what happened to you?
.,.

413
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,998
Officer Mao,
did you hear a noise just now?.

414
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,583
No.

415
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,927
Come to my room later.

416
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,101
Who is it?
.

417
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,769
The innkeeper.

418
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,188
Ah, Mr. Wu.

419
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:13,358
What happened earlier?
.

420
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,110
I don't know.

421
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:26,538
I know.

422
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,541
If you have something to say, say it!

423
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,376
Stop beating around the bush!

424
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:34,212
Who are you to talk to me like that?
.

425
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:38,383
A young man like you,
always insulting and attacking others!

426
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:42,345
If not for your sister,
you'd be dead by now!

427
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,974
Watch what you say,
old man, or I’ll -

428
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:47,934
Still looking for a fight?
.

429
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,936
My brother's hot-tempered.

430
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:54,441
You were always foolish as a child,
and at 30 you haven't changed!

431
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:03,408
Do you know us?
.

432
00:54:06,703 --> 00:54:09,080
It's no wonder you don't recognize me.

433
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:11,833
He was just eight when I met him.

434
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,753
What is your name?
.

435
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,047
Wu Ning.

436
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,594
Were you General Wu
under Minister Yu's command?
.

437
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:26,681
Your father and I served
in the same battalion.

438
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,434
Uncle Wu!

439
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,438
It's been over ten years.

440
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,443
Get up. Come to my room later.

441
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:57,045
How can you tell
they're with the Eastern Depot?
.

442
00:54:57,879 --> 00:54:59,839
I’ve seen many of their kind.

443
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,217
They're here for the YU family.

444
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,803
Uncle Wu what do you think?
,.

445
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,722
What should we do?
.

446
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:11,476
Wait till they're asleep,
then kill them all!

447
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:13,395
By my calculations...

448
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,649
the YU family should be here
by noon tomorrow.

449
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:21,987
At dawn we'll go intercept them
and take them to safety,

450
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:24,447
then come back
and deal with these agents.

451
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,158
These men will probably
go searching at dawn too.

452
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:29,661
We'll have to risk it.

453
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:33,623
Zhu Ji and I will head east.
You and Miss Zhu will go west.

454
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:36,251
We'll have to sneak out quietly.

455
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:54,102
Search him.

456
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:08,700
EUNUCH OF THE EASTERN DEPOT

457
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:12,203
ON SPECIAL IMPERIAL ASSIGNMENT

458
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:03,588
If anything happens,
get word to me immediately.

459
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,392
If things get tough, I’ll just -

460
00:57:17,352 --> 00:57:19,062
Don't do anything reckless.

461
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:27,213
They're coming!

462
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:31,092
Stop yelling and go tell
the second in command.

463
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,760
Let's go.

464
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,525
DRAGON INN

465
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:00,205
Innkeeper is there a room available?
,.

466
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:03,249
A room?
.

467
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:05,710
Yes. This way, please.

468
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:10,506
Get us some food.

469
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:14,093
Draw water, make tea,
and bring out some buns!

470
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,678
Hurry!

471
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:24,896
Water to freshen up.

472
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:29,275
How long will you be staying?
.

473
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,278
- We'll be leaving tomorrow.
- That's fine, then.

474
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:47,085
Go on.

475
01:00:25,248 --> 01:00:26,749
This is bad news!

476
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,418
They've arrived.

477
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,546
Go take them away.

478
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:34,549
If it's too late,
take them to the granary.

479
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:37,969
I’ll go find Xiao. Take the shortcut.

480
01:00:45,893 --> 01:00:48,813
Master YU, run!
Get your family out of here!

481
01:00:49,856 --> 01:00:53,151
These are Eastern Depot agents,
with many more outside.

482
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:56,696
Take them upstairs!

483
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:04,787
Attack!

484
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,807
To the granary! Hurry!

485
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:42,700
Commander,
there are people approaching!

486
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:57,298
Stop them.

487
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,600
You go around back
and open the granary door.

488
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,727
You attack from the front.

489
01:03:47,825 --> 01:03:49,327
Out of my way.

490
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,301
Let's just forget all this, young man.

491
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:08,012
Fine. Release the YU family.

492
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,474
Very well.

493
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:15,019
Go inside
and ask Master YU to come out.

494
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:17,396
I’ll stay here with Master Zhu.

495
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:53,260
Let's go!

496
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:56,847
Miss Zhu!

497
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:20,705
Go out through the granary.

498
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:23,207
You can still catch up with them.

499
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,751
What about you?
.

500
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,962
I’ll deal with these scoundrels.

501
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:31,799
Brother Xiao.

502
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,841
<i>- Mr. Xiao.</i>
- Who's that?
.

503
01:08:13,966 --> 01:08:17,595
<i>Pi Shao-tang.
Could you step out here a minute?</i>

504
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:38,574
What is it Mr Pi?
,..

505
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:44,663
Mr. Xiao, look there.

506
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:52,129
You asked me out here to see this?
.

507
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:55,758
No, but I do think
these men were innocent.

508
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:57,301
Innocent?
.

509
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:00,346
They're always strutting around.

510
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:03,140
They needed a little lesson.

511
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:08,145
The YU family is nothing to you.
Why keep opposing us?

512
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,732
I have no choice.

513
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:15,194
When paid to solve a problem,
one must deliver the goods.

514
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:17,279
In that case, let's have a talk.

515
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:20,825
I’ve chosen my side.

516
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,660
There's nothing to talk about.

517
01:09:22,827 --> 01:09:26,205
Not so. You could still join our side.

518
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:29,458
Join your side? It's not that simple
..

519
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:30,668
Why not?
.

520
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:33,462
This way I win both fame and fortune.

521
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:37,508
I’m paid for saving
the descendants of a loyal minister.

522
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:41,762
My friend, don't be offended...

523
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:46,517
but your Eastern Depot
has quite a reputation.

524
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,311
No need to mince words.

525
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:53,023
The Depot is indeed known
for being evil and vicious,

526
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:55,484
but we do pay very well.

527
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:58,904
Just how well?
.

528
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,699
Depends on what you have to offer.

529
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,038
Well...

530
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,791
you've seen what I can do.

531
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,673
So you're interested?
.

532
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,843
That's right.

533
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:24,471
Our official price is 100 taels of silver.
I’ll double it.

534
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,727
I can't do it for that amount.

535
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,897
Then name your price.

536
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,690
Two hundred taels of gold.

537
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:36,483
It's a deal.

538
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:39,570
In advance.

539
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:42,573
You've gone too far!

540
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:47,244
- What's this?
.
- Play games with me will you?
,.

541
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,930
Get him!

542
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,898
Get back.

543
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,503
Keep this up and I’ll get very angry!

544
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:54,413
Get them out of here!

545
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,187
Now rest a while.

546
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,041
Why bother tending to those men?
.

547
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,792
You be quiet!

548
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:56,553
It's nothing serious.

549
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:03,310
- Let them go.
- Very well.

550
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:08,982
You can all go.

551
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:15,030
- You can't let them go!
- You keep quiet!

552
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:18,158
They'll come back after you again!

553
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:21,954
That's not your concern.
Never mind him. Come along.

554
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:29,169
Go on.

555
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:43,308
Thank you all very much.

556
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:47,062
We don't know what to say.

557
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:49,773
Remember:
Don't drink too much water.

558
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:51,984
Hurry now.

559
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:58,240
Those two are still unconscious.

560
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:17,259
Mr. Wu...

561
01:17:17,384 --> 01:17:19,970
may I have a word with you?
.

562
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:23,598
- Don't listen to him!
- Stay out of this.

563
01:17:33,692 --> 01:17:35,193
Go ahead.

564
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:37,654
Mr. Wu...

565
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:43,076
we're never going back.

566
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:45,203
Why is that?
.

567
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:49,666
If you have no objection...

568
01:17:52,336 --> 01:17:54,254
we'd like to join you.

569
01:17:57,007 --> 01:18:00,302
You wouldn't have
much of a future with us.

570
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:05,015
There's not much of a future
with them either.

571
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:09,478
They commit
the most heinous crimes.

572
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:16,068
We could be killed any moment.

573
01:18:20,197 --> 01:18:22,115
- What's your name?
.
- Duola.

574
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:23,909
What?
.

575
01:18:24,034 --> 01:18:25,952
Duola.

576
01:18:26,078 --> 01:18:27,788
We're Tartars.

577
01:18:27,913 --> 01:18:29,748
This is my younger brother.

578
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:33,418
We've always admired Chinese culture.

579
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:36,838
We dreamed of coming to China
ever since we were boys.

580
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:40,801
When I was 18,
YU Qian was recruiting soldiers.

581
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,845
We journeyed a long way to enlist.

582
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,807
We never imagined...

583
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:50,894
Do you know me?
.

584
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:57,067
Every soldier
under Yu's command knows you.

585
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,988
Then why did you join
the Eastern Depot?.

586
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,951
Just before YU Qian was executed,

587
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,745
I was transferred
to the Imperial Guards.

588
01:19:09,538 --> 01:19:12,749
The day after his execution...

589
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:17,254
I visited his grave
to pay my respects.

590
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:22,217
Little did I know
that Cao Shao-qin would find out.

591
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:25,220
He transferred us
to the Eastern Depot.

592
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:29,099
He made you agents just like that?.

593
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:35,063
May we speak in private?
.

594
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:49,911
Cao took us
into the castration chamber...

595
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,206
and had us castrated.

596
01:20:06,595 --> 01:20:09,973
They probably won't be here
for a day or two.

597
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:13,768
You say that Cao
is a brilliant martial artist.

598
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:16,688
Just how good is he?
.

599
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:18,982
I can't exactly say.

600
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:22,736
He's a masterful swordsman,
fast and precise.

601
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:28,116
But with his asthma,
he mustn't overexert himself.

602
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:33,288
Let's show them, Mr. Xiao.

603
01:20:46,134 --> 01:20:48,094
You think that will do?
.

604
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:54,226
- He's faster than my brother and me.
- Really?
.

605
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,687
This I have to see.

606
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:22,379
They're coming.

607
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,941
<i>Open up.</i>

608
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:46,695
Who's there?
.

609
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:49,155
<i>Mr. Wu, it's Gui YU-Zhang.</i>

610
01:21:57,831 --> 01:21:59,958
- Greetings, Lieutenant Gui.
- Greetings.

611
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:04,004
You can all come out.
He's on our side.

612
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:10,885
Come inside, men.

613
01:22:14,264 --> 01:22:16,266
Where are my twelve soldiers?
.

614
01:22:16,391 --> 01:22:18,435
Killed by agents of the Eastern Depot.

615
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,478
Why did they do that?
.

616
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:23,523
They came here
to kill Minister Yu's family.

617
01:22:23,648 --> 01:22:25,692
Your men were in the way.

618
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:29,279
Mr. Wu, we're old friends.

619
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:32,616
You mustn't do anything rash.

620
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:36,411
Keep an eye on them.
Wait till I sort everything out.

621
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:39,831
Out of my way!

622
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:42,459
Didn't you hear?
Drop your weapon!

623
01:23:55,073 --> 01:23:56,741
Your Excellency.

624
01:23:57,867 --> 01:24:00,370
You've made quite a mess of things.

625
01:24:00,495 --> 01:24:04,290
I have failed, but those men
are formidable opponents.

626
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:07,752
Idiot! Just look at yourself!

627
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:10,338
Go change your clothes!

628
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:11,965
Yes, sir.

629
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,884
Wait!

630
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:19,806
I hear the innkeeper is a Mr. Wu.

631
01:24:20,432 --> 01:24:21,891
That's right.

632
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:26,563
Is it Wu Ning?
.

633
01:24:28,815 --> 01:24:30,900
TO WU NING FROM CAO SHAO-QIN

634
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:51,463
"Brother Wu,
please turn the YU family over to us.

635
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:56,926
Anyone involved in harboring
those criminals will be punished."

636
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,234
Judging from that, he's in the vicinity.

637
01:25:13,777 --> 01:25:17,113
The arrogance of that eunuch!
I’ll go talk to him.

638
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:23,161
Your duty is to guard the border.

639
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:25,580
This is a matter for the state.

640
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:29,834
Stay out of it,
or you're asking for trouble.

641
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,253
Now go back.

642
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:36,549
This is my territory.
Palace eunuchs aren't to interfere here!

643
01:25:37,217 --> 01:25:38,760
How dare you!

644
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:42,722
A lowly lieutenant
speaking to me like that!

645
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:45,141
You're relieved of your duty!

646
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:50,063
Very well. Show me the royal order.

647
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:53,983
Show the lieutenant the royal order.

648
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:13,414
Your Excellency, come look.

649
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:26,946
Take cover outside!

650
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:32,869
TO CAO SHAO-QIN FROM WU NING

651
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:48,718
"I am occupied with business

652
01:29:48,885 --> 01:29:51,179
and thus can't be here to welcome you.

653
01:29:51,304 --> 01:29:53,556
Take care, and may we meet again.
Wu Ning."

654
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:58,621
We'll be safe once we've crossed
over that mountain.

655
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:42,165
Give it here.

656
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:49,964
Come back!

657
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:03,978
Duola, cover me!

658
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:52,568
Go report to His Excellency.
I’ll take care of this sissy.

659
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:03,162
She got him in the shoulder.
Go for his legs!

660
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:11,754
Traitors!

661
01:33:52,295 --> 01:33:53,921
Run!

662
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:41,093
You guard the rear. We'll attack.

663
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:22,862
They've got us surrounded.

664
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:26,449
Cao Shao-qin is trying to trap us.

665
01:36:26,574 --> 01:36:28,909
We have no choice but to fight.

666
01:36:32,163 --> 01:36:34,707
Where are Master YU and the others?
.

667
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:46,135
You stay here with these officers.

668
01:36:46,427 --> 01:36:48,971
We'll go look for the old guy.

669
01:36:51,098 --> 01:36:53,934
I’ll go along. I might be useful.

670
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:57,480
No, stay here and look after them.

671
01:36:57,938 --> 01:37:01,484
I’m afraid you may be no match for him.

672
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:05,196
If we don't return by dusk,

673
01:37:05,321 --> 01:37:07,573
take Master YU and run for your life.

674
01:37:31,597 --> 01:37:35,184
Tell us where Cao Shao-qin is
and we'll let you go.

675
01:37:39,396 --> 01:37:41,649
Where is he?
.

676
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:43,317
Out with it!

677
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:46,028
Talk!

678
01:37:46,195 --> 01:37:47,196
There!

679
01:38:05,256 --> 01:38:09,301
Go tell Cao that Xiao Shao-zi
wants to speak with him.

680
01:38:09,552 --> 01:38:10,970
Go on.

681
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:30,656
Oh? Where are they?
..

682
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:32,366
Just outside.

683
01:38:33,242 --> 01:38:35,160
Tell them to come in.

684
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:58,434
By order of His Excellency,
Xiao Shao-zi is commanded to enter.

685
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:15,159
Cut the formalities
and tell Cao to get out here!

686
01:39:20,831 --> 01:39:22,833
His Excellency.

687
01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:19,890
Which of you is Xiao Shao-zi?
.

688
01:40:26,271 --> 01:40:27,690
I am.

689
01:40:37,574 --> 01:40:40,285
You're fond of meddling in others' affairs.

690
01:40:42,121 --> 01:40:44,707
Only when justice is at stake.

691
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:49,878
I hear you're a skillful fighter.

692
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:53,048
I get by.

693
01:40:53,465 --> 01:40:57,219
I’d never have guessed.
Appearances can be deceiving.

694
01:40:58,137 --> 01:41:01,181
It's true. I’d never have guessed
you were a eunuch.

695
01:41:01,724 --> 01:41:03,100
How dare you!

696
01:41:03,225 --> 01:41:05,978
Save your shrewish tantrums for your men!

697
01:41:14,737 --> 01:41:16,572
I’ll make you an offer:

698
01:41:17,156 --> 01:41:19,575
Turn over the YU family...

699
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:22,870
and I’ll let you go
and forget what's happened.

700
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:26,415
And should you decide to follow me,
I guarantee you

701
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,292
a top position.

702
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:31,712
And if I don't?
.

703
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:37,426
I’m afraid the alternative
isn't very attractive.

704
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:06,288
You're really something, old man!

705
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:16,340
I understand
you've trained since childhood.

706
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:18,550
That's a difficult path.

707
01:42:19,134 --> 01:42:22,721
So many pleasures
of the senses to forego.

708
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:29,728
But I doubt that was so very hard.

709
01:42:29,853 --> 01:42:34,483
You were castrated so young,
certain pleasures were never an option!

710
01:42:57,464 --> 01:43:00,843
Take some men
and look for those YU bastards.

711
01:43:40,007 --> 01:43:42,509
That was close!

712
01:43:42,718 --> 01:43:44,970
I almost became just like you!

713
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:43,278
Stay back!

714
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:40,669
Get back!

715
01:46:27,466 --> 01:46:30,635
Cao, you already lost
what you had down below.

716
01:46:30,761 --> 01:46:33,555
Careful you don't lose what's up top too!

717
01:46:36,683 --> 01:46:40,062
Give up, Cao!
You're too old for this!

718
01:51:33,063 --> 01:51:35,774
THE END

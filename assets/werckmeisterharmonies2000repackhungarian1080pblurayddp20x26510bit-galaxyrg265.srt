00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:04,027
A film by

2
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:17,874
WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES

3
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:51,283
Ten o'clock! Closing up!

4
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:54,494
Gentlemen, please!

5
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:04,046
Just wait a bit for Valuska to show us.

6
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,422
Leave it out!

7
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,526
Valuska. Come on.

8
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:30,697
Show us.

9
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:39,289
Let's make some room
for Valuska to show us!

10
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,365
You are the Sun.

11
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,744
The Sun doesn't move.
This is what it does.

12
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:27,587
You are the Earth.

13
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,633
The Earth is here for a start

14
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,095
and then the Earth moves around the Sun.

15
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:41,435
And now...

16
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:46,064
we'll have an explanation
that simple folks like us

17
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:49,651
can also understand about immortality.

18
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,615
All I ask is that you step with me
into the boundlessness

19
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,868
where constancy,

20
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,287
quietude

21
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,331
and peace,

22
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,544
infinite emptiness reign.

23
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:16,470
And just imagine that
in this infinite sonorous silence

24
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:21,224
everywhere is an impenetrable darkness.

25
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:28,607
Here we only experience general motion

26
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:35,947
and at first we don't notice
the events we are witnessing.

27
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,871
The brilliant light of the Sun

28
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:48,502
always sheds its heat and light
on that side of the Earth

29
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:51,338
which is just then turned towards it.

30
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:54,758
And we stand here in its brilliance.

31
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:06,686
This is the Moon.

32
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,941
The Moon revolves around the Earth.

33
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,079
What is happening?

34
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,164
We suddenly see

35
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:12,043
that the disc of the Moon,
the disc of the Moon...

36
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,089
on the Sun's flaming sphere
makes an indentation

37
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,841
and this indentation,

38
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,761
the dark shadow, grows bigger...
and bigger.

39
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:24,222
And as it covers more and more,

40
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,934
slowly, only a narrow crescent
of the Sun remains,

41
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,145
a dazzling crescent.

42
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:33,231
And at the next moment...

43
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:38,111
the next moment,
say that it's around one in the afternoon,

44
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:42,574
a most dramatic turn of events occurs.

45
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,037
At that moment...

46
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:52,125
the air suddenly turns cold.

47
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,629
Can you feel it?

48
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:59,925
The sky darkens

49
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:03,303
and then goes all dark.

50
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:06,222
The dogs howl,

51
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:09,976
rabbits hunch down, the deer run in panic,

52
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,145
run, stampede in fright.

53
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:16,691
And in this awful, incomprehensible dusk

54
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:19,277
even the birds...

55
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:23,198
the birds too are confused
and go to roost.

56
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,285
And then... complete silence.

57
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,335
Everything that lives is still.

58
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:41,466
Are the hills going to march off?

59
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:47,222
Will Heaven fall upon us?

60
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,433
Will the Earth open under us?
We don't know.

61
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,519
We don't know,

62
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:55,313
for a total eclipse has come upon us.

63
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:39,232
But...

64
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,111
but no need to fear, it's not over.

65
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:48,033
For across the Sun's glowing sphere

66
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,077
slowly the Moon swims away.

67
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:54,998
And the Sun once again bursts forth

68
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:58,168
and to the Earth slowly

69
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:02,380
there comes light again,

70
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:05,050
and warmth again floods the Earth.

71
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,434
Deep emotion pierces everyone.

72
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:17,228
They have escaped the weight of darkness.

73
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:24,671
That's enough!
Out of here, you tubs of beer!

74
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:50,446
But, Mr. Hagelmayer, it's still not over.

75
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,512
Mr. Eszter!

76
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,766
Mr. Eszter!

77
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,482
Uncle György, come on.

78
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,276
You're getting cold.

79
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,362
Please come.

80
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:09,182
Your socks too.

81
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,504
Sleep well.

82
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:59,174
FANTASTIC:
THE WORLD'S LARGEST GIANT WHALE!

83
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:06,265
AND OTHER WONDERS OF NATURE!
GUEST STAR: THE PRINCE

84
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,527
Good evening.

85
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,580
Good evening, Uncle Béla.

86
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,916
You're late today, János.

87
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,754
How's János?
How are things in the cosmos?

88
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:39,840
Everything is fine.

89
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:44,762
Thanks.

90
00:23:50,893 --> 00:23:53,479
<i>Family tragedies come in succession.</i>

91
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,606
<i>One just after the other.</i>

92
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:00,986
<i>Now, if a family takes hold of itself,
they simply disappear.</i>

93
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:03,280
<i>And nobody knows anything about it.</i>

94
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:07,451
<i>Now don't tell me that this is normal.
A normal proceeding.</i>

95
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,872
<i>The world has gone completely mad.</i>

96
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,086
<i>Now it's not down here but up there
where something's gone wrong.</i>

97
00:24:19,964 --> 00:24:21,674
<i>For in November</i>

98
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,927
<i>the Radio says that it's 1 7 below.</i>

99
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,596
<i>There's a shortage of coal.</i>

100
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:32,351
And then to top it all,
there's the arrival of the circus.

101
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:37,731
They're bringing that
horrible great whale, and that Prince.

102
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:40,818
All of ten kilos.

103
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:45,197
They say he's carried in their arms,
has to be.

104
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,659
And for that matter, he's got three eyes.

105
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,204
I don't know if that's true or not.

106
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:55,916
They say that he's taken from town to town

107
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,919
and makes that godless, monstrous speech.

108
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,215
Nobody knows for sure.

109
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,137
Even those who were there
don't understand it!

110
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:11,181
They say that
in the market square of Sarkad,

111
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,475
when they were bringing the Prince around,

112
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:16,395
the clock of the church began to go,
just like that.

113
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:20,899
The clock that had stopped years ago,
and there it started all over again.

114
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:24,319
And the poplar tree fell.

115
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,448
A great crack

116
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:29,408
and out came its roots

117
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:32,578
from the concrete.

118
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,456
No wonder people are afraid.

119
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:38,333
There isn't anyone
who dares leave the house after dark.

120
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,587
They're afraid of being attacked,
burgled, robbed.

121
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:46,216
Plundered, stabbed, raped.
You have to keep a dog.

122
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:47,968
The mind just boggles.

123
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:50,429
You have to have a dog for these rascals.

124
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,099
But once again

125
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:56,560
nothing is sacred.

126
00:25:56,727 --> 00:26:00,689
They went and pulled down
the statues in the Gondocs Gardens.

127
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,028
They stole the headstones
from the graveyard.

128
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,407
So how can you explain all this
in normal terms?

129
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:13,869
The mysterious unknown plagues are here.

130
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,459
Great frozen mountains of refuse
are everywhere.

131
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:25,339
People bolt the door and tremble,

132
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,008
dreading what is to come.

133
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:30,260
It's certain that something is to come.

134
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,690
How's our János?

135
00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:09,401
Good morning, Uncle Karcsi.

136
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,842
- Have you seen them?
- No. Who?

137
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:42,768
You don't know anything?

138
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:46,271
- No.
- Listen.

139
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,107
Apparently,

140
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,820
they came on the evening train yesterday.

141
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:57,491
Because of the whale.

142
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:04,081
Well, you can never know.

143
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,710
You can never know anything for sure.

144
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:31,566
Some say
there's at least three hundred of them,

145
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:33,193
someone else

146
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:38,156
that there's only two of them actually,

147
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:40,867
and that the whole attraction

148
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:43,203
is the most frightening thing
that you would ever see.

149
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:49,209
It's also said that the whole thing
is just a cover-up for other things.

150
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:53,338
That when night comes,

151
00:29:56,758 --> 00:29:59,136
they'll swoop down
on the peaceful inhabitants.

152
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:03,223
They also say...

153
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:12,107
the whale's got no part in it.

154
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,571
Then the next moment,

155
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:24,453
that the whale is the cause of it all.

156
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:35,797
What's sure is that
they're already looting.

157
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:39,801
They broke the windows
of the clothing shop.

158
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:43,388
The stoker saw that with his own eyes.

159
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,018
If I go that way, I'll take a look.

160
00:30:58,653 --> 00:30:59,863
Goodbye.

161
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:41,006
I have to make it clear that
not even for a moment

162
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,468
is there a doubt that
it is not a technical

163
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:49,014
but a philosophical question.

164
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:57,022
So that the tonal system in question,
through research,

165
00:32:57,647 --> 00:33:01,234
has led us inevitably to a test of faith,

166
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,487
in which we ask:

167
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:06,281
On what do we base our belief

168
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:09,034
that this harmony,

169
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,495
the core of every masterpiece,

170
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:14,080
referring to its own irrevocability,

171
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:17,209
actually exists or not?

172
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:21,129
From this it follows

173
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:27,344
that we should speak of,
not research into music,

174
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:31,181
but a unique realization of non-music

175
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,725
which for centuries has been covered up

176
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,520
and a dreadful scandal

177
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:40,857
which we should disclose.

178
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:45,737
Hence the shameful situation

179
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:51,409
that all the intervals
in the masterpieces of many centuries

180
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:54,079
are false.

181
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:56,665
Which means

182
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:59,000
that music

183
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:04,422
and its harmony and echo,
its unsurpassable enchantment

184
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:08,009
is entirely based on a false foundation.

185
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:12,806
Yes, we have to speak
of an indisputable deception,

186
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:14,933
even if those who are less sure,

187
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:19,145
a little moderate,

188
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:22,232
babble on about compromise.

189
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,651
But what kind of compromise,

190
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:27,112
when for the majority

191
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:30,115
pure musical tonality

192
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:32,284
is simply illusion,

193
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:34,661
and truly pure

194
00:34:34,828 --> 00:34:37,289
musical intervals do not exist?

195
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:41,126
Here we have to acknowledge the fact

196
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,380
that there were ages
more fortunate than ours,

197
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:49,342
those of Pythagoras and Aristoxenes,

198
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:53,179
when our forefathers were satisfied
with the fact

199
00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:56,600
that their purely tuned instruments

200
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:59,561
were played in only some tones,

201
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:04,232
because they were not troubled by doubts,

202
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:09,321
for they knew that heavenly harmonies
were the province of the gods.

203
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:14,534
Later, all this was not enough.

204
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:17,996
Unhinged arrogance

205
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:21,583
wished to take possession
of all the harmonies

206
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,088
of the gods.

207
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,924
And it was done in its own way.

208
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,886
Technicians were charged
with the solution,

209
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:35,847
a Praetorius, a Salinas,

210
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:39,476
and finally an Andreas Werckmeister,

211
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:42,729
who resolved the difficulty

212
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:47,776
by dividing the octave of the harmony
of the gods, the twelve half-tones,

213
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:51,196
into twelve equal parts.

214
00:35:52,072 --> 00:35:54,908
Of two semi-tones, he falsified one.

215
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:58,870
Instead of ten black keys,
five were used

216
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:02,207
and that sealed the position.

217
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:08,672
We have to turn our backs
on this development of tuning instruments,

218
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:14,636
the so-called constant-tempered
and its sad history,

219
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,724
and bring back
the naturally tuned instrument.

220
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:26,606
Carefully, we have to correct
Werckmeister's mistakes.

221
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:31,945
We have to concern ourselves
with these seven notes of the scale

222
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:37,617
but not as of the octave,

223
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:39,994
but

224
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:41,496
seven

225
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:45,792
distinct and independent qualities

226
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,713
like seven fraternal stars in the heavens.

227
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,801
What we have to do then,

228
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:57,303
if we are aware,

229
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:02,892
is that this natural tuning
has its limits,

230
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:09,733
and it is a somewhat worrisome limit

231
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:13,862
that definitely excludes

232
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:16,239
the use of certain

233
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:18,199
higher signatures.

234
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,887
- How much?
- A hundred forints.

235
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,897
Thanks.

236
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:19,555
Tell me, what's in there?

237
00:45:19,722 --> 00:45:22,892
People are chattering about some Prince.

238
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:25,186
Certainly not, Mr. Árgyelán.

239
00:45:25,353 --> 00:45:27,855
A giant whale has arrived.

240
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:33,361
This mysterious creature from the sea
has come from the far-off oceans.

241
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:36,822
Most definitely you have to see it too.

242
00:45:37,406 --> 00:45:39,742
I don't like this at all, János.

243
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:43,412
Nothing wrong with it, Mr. Árgyelán.

244
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,623
Just see what a gigantic animal...

245
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,501
...the Lord can create!

246
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:50,586
How mysterious is the Lord

247
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:53,381
that he amuses Himself
with such strange creatures.

248
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:55,508
It'll lead to trouble, János.

249
00:47:30,603 --> 00:47:32,021
How's János?

250
00:47:32,188 --> 00:47:34,273
Good morning, Uncle Lajos.

251
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:15,202
Good morning, Auntie Tünde.

252
00:51:17,663 --> 00:51:19,206
How's János?

253
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:18,557
I've come about very important
and serious business.

254
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:21,769
It's about my former husband.

255
00:52:21,935 --> 00:52:25,105
I know that you are close to him,
that you are devoted to him.

256
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:27,441
I've done everything too for him.

257
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:31,987
No, I never ever wished him harm.

258
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:35,491
I made the greatest sacrifice for him:

259
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,453
I moved out.

260
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,164
At his request.

261
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:45,292
So he can devote himself to his art.

262
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:49,755
By doing this I gave up the position

263
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:52,549
due to me in the town.

264
00:52:57,638 --> 00:52:59,390
Now it is his turn.

265
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:03,852
Now he has to make a sacrifice.

266
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,522
That's easy to understand.

267
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,450
You do understand, János?

268
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:28,252
So with the police chief

269
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:32,589
and some more people of good will
we are establishing a movement

270
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:35,884
which will restore order,
create cleanliness,

271
00:53:36,051 --> 00:53:38,679
and we are procuring the necessary funds.

272
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:42,766
You can see that a movement like this
needs a chairman,

273
00:53:44,518 --> 00:53:47,855
a strong individual, who...

274
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:51,650
has influence over others,
who is persuasive.

275
00:53:52,568 --> 00:53:53,986
And he,

276
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:56,280
he is such a personality.

277
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,910
Yes, and now two possibilities
offer themselves.

278
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:06,415
One is that he accepts the chairmanship

279
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:09,960
and everything remains as it was.

280
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:13,714
The second is that he says no and then...

281
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:16,675
Yes. And then

282
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:20,012
I'll have to move back in with him,

283
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:22,139
and...

284
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:26,435
to convince him of my serious intention,

285
00:54:26,602 --> 00:54:30,731
I'm sending my suitcase ahead of me.
All my things are in it.

286
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,278
Everything has been prepared.

287
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:41,992
Here is the list.

288
00:54:45,913 --> 00:54:47,915
On it are all the people

289
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:50,584
of good will and standing in the town.

290
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:55,839
He should seek them out
and win them round to the cause.

291
00:54:58,509 --> 00:55:00,427
Just a few signatures,

292
00:55:02,054 --> 00:55:04,932
and then he can sit back again
at his piano

293
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:06,558
and strum away.

294
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,278
Auntie Tünde, I...

295
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:20,239
I know that...

296
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:23,742
The fact is...

297
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:28,121
Uncle György isn't very well and...

298
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,459
I'd like to lie down for a while myself,

299
00:55:33,794 --> 00:55:38,382
because I worked all night
and I think that he won't be able

300
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:42,594
to take this on.

301
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:45,305
- But...
- So please don't be annoyed.

302
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:49,518
You have to understand that
there's no time to put this off.

303
00:55:51,103 --> 00:55:53,856
If he doesn't collect all the signatures

304
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:56,483
by 4 this afternoon at the latest,

305
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:58,735
then...

306
00:56:00,612 --> 00:56:03,907
I'll move back in with him,
no matter how difficult it will be for me.

307
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:09,746
It's impossible
in that wretched hovel I live in

308
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:11,206
to organize all this.

309
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:13,584
Do you understand?

310
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:27,556
I see, but...

311
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,558
This is the time that

312
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:33,353
Uncle György likes to work and I...

313
00:56:36,231 --> 00:56:38,817
Now wouldn't be a good time

314
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:41,528
for me to go to him, because...

315
00:56:44,698 --> 00:56:45,991
you see,

316
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:49,953
I'm very tired.

317
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,587
But, yes, he'll succeed,

318
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,966
so go and talk to him at home.

319
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:11,183
Just say that
what I'm waiting for him to do

320
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,226
is to show an example,

321
00:57:13,393 --> 00:57:16,229
to come forward with money
for this movement.

322
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:21,109
And add to that, if he doesn't,

323
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:23,946
then

324
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:27,532
I'll be having supper with him

325
00:57:29,451 --> 00:57:30,911
this very evening.

326
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,576
- Hello, Lajos.
- Good morning, ma'am.

327
00:58:11,743 --> 00:58:12,869
Good morning.

328
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,205
How's it going?

329
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:17,017
LAJOS HARRER Jr.
BOOT AND SHOEMAKER

330
00:59:55,388 --> 00:59:57,015
Good morning, Aunt Harrer.

331
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:11,905
How's János? So you're here.

332
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:13,657
That I am.

333
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:17,244
What's happening outside?
What did you see on your way here?

334
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,747
- Will I be able to get home?
- Of course, you will.

335
01:00:20,914 --> 01:00:23,291
There's talk that
they're breaking shop windows

336
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:25,335
and set fire to the hotel.

337
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:28,088
And the butcher got his head cracked open.

338
01:00:28,255 --> 01:00:31,716
No wonder an honest person
doesn't dare go out in the street.

339
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:34,553
Don't be afraid, Aunt Harrer.
Just be calm.

340
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,805
You can go home without any worry.

341
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:43,812
Being careful never hurt anybody.

342
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:46,982
I said not to get excited.
There's no problem.

343
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:49,109
You can go home easily.

344
01:01:29,024 --> 01:01:33,612
On this perfectly tuned instrument
you yourself can hear

345
01:01:35,363 --> 01:01:38,325
how grating is the E flat prelude

346
01:01:39,326 --> 01:01:41,703
from the <i>Wohltemperierties Klavier.</i>

347
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:46,917
This is for you from Auntie Tünde.

348
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:02,307
She asks you to get dressed

349
01:02:02,474 --> 01:02:05,393
in your warm clothes,
because it's very cold outside,

350
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,480
and to set off to find these people
and persuade them

351
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:11,650
to join the Clean Town Movement,
and you'll be chairman.

352
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:16,821
Because she and the Chief of Police
would like to restore order

353
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:19,991
in the town and because
the people won't say no to you.

354
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:24,412
She also says that
if you do not feel like doing that,

355
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:28,708
then she'll have supper here today,
"this very evening."

356
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,920
That's why she sends this case
with her clothes,

357
01:02:32,087 --> 01:02:34,089
so that she won't have to carry it.

358
01:02:36,716 --> 01:02:38,593
We're not going anywhere.

359
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,596
Neither now, nor later.

360
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:43,932
But...

361
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:47,727
Auntie Tünde says you should do everything

362
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:50,897
- by 4 this afternoon...
- János, just don't worry...

363
01:02:51,523 --> 01:02:53,233
There will be no trouble.

364
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:58,863
We haven't yet
and we won't move from here.

365
01:03:00,782 --> 01:03:04,911
Especially not for this stupid slattern
and her petty-minded

366
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:07,497
and evil command.

367
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:12,502
Aunt Tünde also says that
if you take on the chairmanship,

368
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,380
everything will remain as it was.

369
01:03:23,471 --> 01:03:25,432
We're not going to do anything.

370
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:30,186
We're not going to make
the same mistake twice.

371
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,733
I'll be coming with you, see.

372
01:03:35,942 --> 01:03:38,111
It's no big thing, Uncle György.

373
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:42,282
We'd better start.
We'll be late for four o'clock.

374
01:03:43,742 --> 01:03:46,411
Aunt Tünde doesn't mean you any harm.

375
01:03:48,163 --> 01:03:52,417
See, we'll go there, arrange it all
in a couple of hours and come back.

376
01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:55,545
And then she wouldn't come back here,
this evening or any other time...

377
01:03:57,881 --> 01:03:59,924
Believe me, Uncle György,

378
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:02,302
Auntie Tünde is very determined.

379
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,686
So this is serious, you think?

380
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:14,356
Yes.

381
01:04:19,402 --> 01:04:21,654
Let's suppose I comply,

382
01:04:22,572 --> 01:04:25,033
will you take the case back then?

383
01:04:26,034 --> 01:04:27,243
Yes.

384
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,596
I'm finished for now, Mr. Eszter.

385
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:50,183
Thank you, Mrs. Harrer.
Your money is on the writing table.

386
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,894
Thank you.
I'll be here at the usual time on Friday.

387
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:01,986
A little fresh air won't hurt you.

388
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:11,663
Goodbye.

389
01:05:16,835 --> 01:05:19,254
János, would you be so kind

390
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,590
as to get that out of here?

391
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:26,428
Go and find the furthest point
in the house

392
01:05:26,594 --> 01:05:28,471
and put it there.

393
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:30,598
Right away.

394
01:05:32,142 --> 01:05:33,893
Come on then, Uncle György.

395
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:30,950
So if we're going like this,
I can fetch your lunch.

396
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:37,624
I knew she wouldn't give up,
she couldn't stand it

397
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:42,086
and that she'd be in contact sometime.

398
01:06:53,973 --> 01:06:57,185
For a moment of madness,
what a price to pay.

399
01:07:24,128 --> 01:07:26,130
<i>It's all the same in the end.</i>

400
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:29,050
<i>I've paid for it
and I may pay for it all my life.</i>

401
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:34,681
<i>I'll split the slut's skull
"this very evening."</i>

402
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:41,437
Uncle György,
let's go towards the market square

403
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:45,149
and then you can see for yourself
the giant whale,

404
01:07:45,316 --> 01:07:48,611
as long as twenty meters
and you can see into its throat,

405
01:07:49,404 --> 01:07:51,364
and it really stinks.

406
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:54,826
And all a man can do is look upon it

407
01:07:54,993 --> 01:07:58,705
and see how great
is the Lord's creative impulse

408
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:03,585
and power, and how omnipotence
is reflected in that animal.

409
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:07,672
That's what has to be looked at,
must be seen, Uncle György.

410
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,550
First let's finish with this damned list.

411
01:10:08,668 --> 01:10:12,630
- Good afternoon, Mr. Eszter, János.
- It's you I was looking for.

412
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:14,215
Good afternoon, Mr. Eszter.

413
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:18,344
- Something has to be done.
- We can't count on the power supply,

414
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:20,930
the school and the town hall are closed.

415
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:24,308
Because of the shortage of coal,
the problems of heating homes

416
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:27,061
have taken on terrible dimensions...

417
01:10:27,228 --> 01:10:30,982
There are no medicines,
traveling by bus or car is finished.

418
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:34,318
The telephones have gone dead.
There's no street lighting...

419
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:37,697
And to top it all here comes this circus

420
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:41,367
with this horrendous whale and Prince!

421
01:10:41,534 --> 01:10:44,203
With blasphemous words
inciting people to riot!

422
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:47,915
When we don't know if the world's
coming to an end by tomorrow!

423
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:51,836
And to allow in that motley nightmare
with that stinking monster,

424
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:54,172
when the town itself is under threat?

425
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:57,258
Who can think of amusement in this chaos?

426
01:10:58,092 --> 01:11:01,429
I'd like to draw your attention
to the need for solidarity.

427
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:04,182
Common sense is the most important...

428
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:09,228
We can't look on passively
while catastrophe swoops down on us...

429
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,189
Children and mothers are in tears...

430
01:11:11,355 --> 01:11:13,316
The Earth is in dire peril!

431
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:15,818
A moment, gentlemen.

432
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:18,404
Uncle György, take it easy.

433
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:19,822
Not now...

434
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:26,162
From your despondent words,
the situation must be serious,

435
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:30,500
and in the interest of restoring order
we have to take action.

436
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:36,297
So, Uncle György, I'll run off and get
your lunch before the kitchen closes.

437
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:37,715
Off you go.

438
01:11:54,732 --> 01:11:56,651
Now then, gentlemen,

439
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:58,069
here is...

440
01:11:58,653 --> 01:12:00,321
Here is this list.

441
01:12:07,453 --> 01:12:09,539
Now then, let's go through it,

442
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:11,499
before

443
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:16,712
every one of us loses our head,

444
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:24,345
and try to rise above
the threat hanging over us.

445
01:12:49,453 --> 01:12:50,746
Good afternoon!

446
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:56,043
- How's our János?
- Good afternoon.

447
01:12:57,628 --> 01:13:00,923
You're late, János.
We want to get off to go home.

448
01:13:02,008 --> 01:13:03,217
Good afternoon.

449
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:54,894
Right.

450
01:13:55,061 --> 01:13:57,396
- Here you are. Take care...
- Thank you.

451
01:13:57,563 --> 01:13:59,982
- Goodbye, Uncle Karcsi.
- Bye-bye, János.

452
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:39,999
What's going to happen to the whale?

453
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,543
My friend,
it'll be four o'clock in a minute.

454
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,879
The most important thing
you can do is go to her

455
01:15:45,046 --> 01:15:48,424
and tell her that I've done
what she asked.

456
01:15:48,591 --> 01:15:50,801
- But...
- It would have been good

457
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:53,304
to meet this excellent being

458
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:56,557
to scrutinize him,
a point on the evolutionary scale

459
01:15:56,724 --> 01:15:59,518
where I would have happily stopped.

460
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:03,189
A meeting both pleasurable
and entertaining.

461
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,815
But...

462
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,777
this walk has exhausted me,

463
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:09,695
and

464
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:13,532
a meeting with this whale of yours

465
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:18,079
may well be, I think,
just as captivating tomorrow.

466
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:35,137
Goodbye.

467
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:37,556
All the best to you. Bye!

468
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:50,147
Hey, kid!

469
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:51,941
What are you doing here?

470
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,612
Who are you?

471
01:18:56,779 --> 01:18:58,364
János Valuska.

472
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:07,289
What do you want here?

473
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,542
I'm...

474
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:14,838
I'm on an errand, I'm the...

475
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:17,841
Mr. Eszter told me to...

476
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:20,302
- Mr. Eszter...
- Aha.

477
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,514
...who on Auntie Tünde's request...

478
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:27,601
- Drink this.
- Just that...

479
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:30,145
Let's hear it.

480
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:34,441
He was requested to go
and Auntie Tünde when she arrives...

481
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:38,362
Your attention please!
Our show is over for today.

482
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:41,198
For technical reasons

483
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:44,201
the appearance of the Prince
has been canceled.

484
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:48,872
All the best until our ticket office
opens tomorrow morning.

485
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:51,583
I thank you for your attention,

486
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,087
and commend our company again to you.

487
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:57,506
So, please go home.

488
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,720
Go!

489
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:07,803
<i>Filthy gang! No class!</i>

490
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:09,972
<i>Swine!</i>

491
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:17,146
<i>Dirty swine! Rabble!</i>

492
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,730
<i>Rogues!</i>

493
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,526
Good evening, Auntie Tünde.

494
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:29,032
Uncle György sent me to tell Auntie Tünde

495
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,994
that all that you asked has been arranged,

496
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:35,330
and the organizing
of the whole thing is under way,

497
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:39,334
so I'm to bring your case here
this evening, right away.

498
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:41,837
That doesn't concern us now, János.

499
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:47,634
Are they ripping the square apart?

500
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:49,386
Or setting it on fire?

501
01:22:50,554 --> 01:22:53,891
The whale, the great sensation
of the century, has arrived,

502
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:56,643
a gigantic, wonderful whale, and...

503
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,020
Wait a moment.

504
01:22:58,562 --> 01:23:02,983
<i>The whole squad advances! Attack!</i>

505
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:05,986
<i>Bastards!</i>

506
01:23:08,363 --> 01:23:12,826
<i>Show no mercy! Shoot right into them.</i>

507
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:16,163
<i>I've called for the tanks.</i>

508
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:20,375
Don't!

509
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:22,961
Don't.

510
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:26,423
- What are you trying to do?
- Lie down and go to sleep.

511
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:29,009
Stop it! Get away from me!

512
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:31,970
No time for sleeping, resting!

513
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:36,141
- Out of the question!
- That's enough! Go and lie down!

514
01:23:36,308 --> 01:23:37,601
Now wait!

515
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:39,436
Just wait!

516
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,772
Pull yourself together, act like a man!

517
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:42,940
Stay!

518
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,068
Stay. Don't go!

519
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:50,614
<i>Tünde!</i>

520
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:59,248
I have something important
I want you to do.

521
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:04,294
Go to the police chief's home
and put his children to bed.

522
01:24:04,962 --> 01:24:07,130
Tell them he's going to be late,

523
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:11,510
then go to the main square,
take a look around,

524
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:16,557
observe how many there are,
who is talking to who and what about,

525
01:24:16,723 --> 01:24:19,309
then come back here
and tell us everything.

526
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:22,604
Delighted to oblige, Auntie Tünde.
I'll go and take a look around.

527
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,816
I'll gladly observe
and tell you everything,

528
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:28,277
who is talking to who, then.

529
01:24:29,528 --> 01:24:31,154
I've just come from there,

530
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:35,200
I'd like to find out
just what this strange secret is.

531
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:37,869
- Off you go.
- Goodbye.

532
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:11,069
Now, my little witch,
do you know who wrote this piece?

533
01:25:15,907 --> 01:25:17,034
Just dance!

534
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:33,008
Just dance!

535
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:54,112
Do you like it?

536
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:03,724
Off to bed with you!

537
01:27:04,307 --> 01:27:07,394
- I don't want to go to bed!
- Off to bed!

538
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,272
I'm not going to bed!

539
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:13,358
- Go and get into bed!
- No!

540
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:27,748
That was just a pat.

541
01:27:35,922 --> 01:27:37,966
I didn't really hit you.

542
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,894
I'll be hard on you.

543
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,823
I'll be hard on you.

544
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:10,874
Go to bed, both of you!

545
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:12,501
I don't want to.

546
01:28:47,953 --> 01:28:49,621
I'll be hard on you.

547
01:28:52,499 --> 01:28:54,417
I'll be hard on you.

548
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:03,593
I'll be hard on you.

549
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,766
I'll be hard on you. I'll be hard on you.

550
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:12,894
I'll be hard on you.

551
01:29:16,147 --> 01:29:19,776
I'll be hard on you. I'll be hard on you.

552
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:24,948
I'll be hard on you. I'll be hard on you.

553
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:30,745
I'll be hard on you.

554
01:29:39,087 --> 01:29:42,591
I'll be hard on you. I'll be hard on you.

555
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:16,207
Good evening, Uncle Lajos.

556
01:30:16,374 --> 01:30:19,461
How's it going...
what are you doing here, János?

557
01:30:20,378 --> 01:30:21,796
Auntie Tünde sent me.

558
01:30:22,631 --> 01:30:25,383
She said to go to the market square,

559
01:30:25,926 --> 01:30:28,261
and take a look around
to see what was happening

560
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:33,099
and tell her about everything,
who's doing what, who's talking to who.

561
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:36,853
Don't go there, János,
this is not for us...

562
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:40,482
They'll have to get the army in.

563
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:42,776
There's nothing we can do now.

564
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:46,446
I'll watch out.

565
01:30:47,781 --> 01:30:49,741
Be careful, János.

566
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:53,078
Goodbye, Uncle Lajos.

567
01:31:28,738 --> 01:31:30,115
Good evening.

568
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:35,448
Sorry.

569
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:39,077
The whale...

570
01:33:40,036 --> 01:33:42,330
Can't I see the whale now?

571
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:45,083
Or in the morning?

572
01:33:46,417 --> 01:33:48,086
Fuck off out of here.

573
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,891
See how much trouble you've caused!

574
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:30,980
Even though you haven't been able
to harm anyone for a long time.

575
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:41,407
<i>...and not from the whole.
As the Director imagines.</i>

576
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:46,037
<i>I don't imagine anything, but I know</i>

577
01:35:46,204 --> 01:35:50,500
<i>that if he doesn't calm them
but fires them up,</i>

578
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:53,336
<i>then the whole thing is going
to start all over again!</i>

579
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:57,715
<i>And tell him this too.
That I take his impudence badly.</i>

580
01:35:58,424 --> 01:35:59,968
<i>- Translate that!
- Why?!</i>

581
01:36:00,134 --> 01:36:03,680
<i>So that it'll get through
that infantile skull of his</i>

582
01:36:03,846 --> 01:36:07,350
<i>that he cannot go out,
that you aren't going to take him out.</i>

583
01:36:07,517 --> 01:36:10,812
<i>You're not going to pick him up
and translate for him.</i>

584
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:12,772
<i>But he sticks to me!</i>

585
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:17,110
<i>I won't stand for his stirring up
the rabble with his lies.</i>

586
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:20,655
<i>Tell him that we have finished now
once and for all.</i>

587
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:24,075
<i>He never wished to go anywhere.
The Director takes him.</i>

588
01:36:24,242 --> 01:36:29,872
I engaged him to show himself,
and not to stir and incite.

589
01:36:30,456 --> 01:36:33,626
I won't let him out
and let him speak. Translate that.

590
01:36:33,793 --> 01:36:35,086
No point.

591
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:38,339
No one can stop him, whatever they do.

592
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:43,052
I won't stand for his tearing
the town apart with these bandits.

593
01:36:43,219 --> 01:36:46,723
I am not willing to risk
the good name of the company.

594
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:49,976
The last time was positively the last.

595
01:36:50,643 --> 01:36:51,811
No way!

596
01:36:52,395 --> 01:36:53,730
Ridiculous!

597
01:36:53,896 --> 01:36:57,692
He doesn't recognize any
superior authority. Nothing of that kind.

598
01:36:57,859 --> 01:37:01,029
In the eyes of his followers out there,
he is the Prince.

599
01:37:01,195 --> 01:37:04,449
No ordinary force can hold him,
he has magnetic power!

600
01:37:04,615 --> 01:37:08,619
His magnetic power is a disfigurement!
He is an aberration!

601
01:37:08,786 --> 01:37:11,497
A born freak who knows nothing
about anything!

602
01:37:11,664 --> 01:37:15,084
The title of Prince I bestowed on him
for commercial reasons.

603
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:18,713
Tell him that I invented him.

604
01:37:19,547 --> 01:37:21,799
His followers are waiting outside!

605
01:37:21,966 --> 01:37:24,677
They are losing patience.
To them he is the Prince!

606
01:37:24,844 --> 01:37:26,596
- Then he is fired!
- Fine!

607
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:30,850
From now on, he seeks independence.
He's taking me with him.

608
01:37:31,017 --> 01:37:32,602
- You!
- Me.

609
01:37:33,686 --> 01:37:36,606
I shall do what he wants,
because he means money.

610
01:37:36,773 --> 01:37:39,734
You are poor.
The Prince means money for you.

611
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:42,236
Will you stop poncing about!

612
01:37:47,658 --> 01:37:50,078
Why don't we try to arrange something?

613
01:37:50,578 --> 01:37:51,996
Tell him...

614
01:37:52,914 --> 01:37:55,625
that I'll let him out, on one condition.

615
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:59,545
That he doesn't open his mouth,
not even a single word,

616
01:37:59,712 --> 01:38:02,131
and he is to be as silent as the grave.

617
01:38:02,632 --> 01:38:03,800
Tell him that.

618
01:38:13,935 --> 01:38:16,521
The Director cannot lay down any rules!

619
01:38:17,563 --> 01:38:21,901
The Director gets the money,
the Prince gets his followers.

620
01:38:22,068 --> 01:38:26,072
There's no point in arguing!
The Prince alone sees the whole.

621
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:28,282
And the whole is nothing.

622
01:38:29,242 --> 01:38:32,036
Completely in ruins.

623
01:38:32,745 --> 01:38:35,832
What they build and what they will build,

624
01:38:35,998 --> 01:38:39,919
what they do and what they will do,
is delusion and lies.

625
01:38:40,086 --> 01:38:42,755
Under construction,
everything is only half complete.

626
01:38:42,922 --> 01:38:44,799
In ruins, all is complete.

627
01:38:44,966 --> 01:38:49,095
What they think is ridiculous.
They think because they are afraid.

628
01:38:49,846 --> 01:38:51,681
And he who is afraid knows nothing.

629
01:38:51,848 --> 01:38:53,850
The Director doesn't understand

630
01:38:54,016 --> 01:38:57,061
that his followers are not afraid
and do understand him.

631
01:38:58,354 --> 01:39:01,441
His followers are going
to make ruins of everything!

632
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,943
Confused drivel!

633
01:39:05,361 --> 01:39:08,781
Tell that to the rabble and not to me.

634
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:12,326
I won't listen to this anymore.
I'll wash my hands of him,

635
01:39:12,493 --> 01:39:15,037
I won't take responsibility
for what he does.

636
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,168
You gentlemen,
from this moment on, are free.

637
01:39:20,918 --> 01:39:23,171
<i>You can do what you want.</i>

638
01:39:23,337 --> 01:39:25,339
<i>If they destroy the towns,</i>

639
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:28,551
<i>after a while, there will be nowhere left
for him to go.</i>

640
01:39:28,718 --> 01:39:29,927
<i>Does he know that?</i>

641
01:39:37,768 --> 01:39:41,856
<i>His followers do. Tell him.
There is disillusion in everything.</i>

642
01:39:42,023 --> 01:39:44,025
<i>They don't understand why.</i>

643
01:39:44,192 --> 01:39:46,277
<i>But the Prince knows full well</i>

644
01:39:46,444 --> 01:39:49,864
<i>that it is because the whole is nothing.
They are finished.</i>

645
01:39:50,031 --> 01:39:51,991
<i>We crush them with our fury!</i>

646
01:39:52,742 --> 01:39:56,412
<i>We punish them! We will be pitiless!</i>

647
01:39:56,913 --> 01:39:58,539
<i>The day has come!</i>

648
01:40:01,834 --> 01:40:03,961
<i>There will be nothing left!</i>

649
01:40:05,755 --> 01:40:07,298
<i>Fury overcomes all!</i>

650
01:40:08,299 --> 01:40:10,176
<i>Their silver and gold...</i>

651
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:13,346
<i>cannot protect them!</i>

652
01:40:14,013 --> 01:40:16,516
<i>We'll take possession of their houses!</i>

653
01:40:16,682 --> 01:40:19,477
<i>Terror is here! Massacre!</i>

654
01:40:21,562 --> 01:40:23,606
<i>Show no mercy! Slaughter!</i>

655
01:41:32,341 --> 01:41:34,010
Arson.

656
01:57:45,939 --> 01:57:51,903
<i>When the clamor died down,</i>

657
01:57:52,779 --> 01:57:58,118
<i>the Prince said this:</i>

658
01:57:59,452 --> 01:58:03,540
<i>"What they build</i>

659
01:58:03,707 --> 01:58:10,630
<i>"and what they will build.</i>

660
01:58:11,715 --> 01:58:15,343
<i>"What they do</i>

661
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:22,434
<i>"and what they will do.</i>

662
01:58:24,728 --> 01:58:31,735
<i>"Is delusion and lies.</i>

663
01:58:33,737 --> 01:58:38,116
<i>"What they think</i>

664
01:58:38,283 --> 01:58:45,206
<i>"and what they will think.</i>

665
01:58:46,041 --> 01:58:48,835
<i>"Is ridiculous.</i>

666
01:58:49,002 --> 01:58:55,925
<i>"They think because they are afraid.</i>

667
01:58:56,801 --> 01:59:03,808
<i>"And he who is afraid.</i>

668
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:06,978
<i>Knows nothing."</i>

669
01:59:07,145 --> 01:59:14,069
<i>He says he likes it</i>

670
01:59:16,112 --> 01:59:23,119
<i>when things fall apart.</i>

671
01:59:24,412 --> 01:59:27,207
<i>"There is construction in all ruins..."</i>

672
01:59:27,374 --> 01:59:30,585
"A single emotion for destruction,
implacable, deadly.

673
01:59:30,752 --> 01:59:34,464
"We didn't find the real object
of our abhorrence and despair,

674
01:59:34,631 --> 01:59:38,927
"so we rushed at everything we came
across with wilder and wilder fury.

675
01:59:39,094 --> 01:59:42,722
"We destroyed the shops,
threw out and trampled everything

676
01:59:42,889 --> 01:59:46,351
"that was movable,
and what we couldn't move

677
01:59:47,102 --> 01:59:50,855
"we broke up with slats of shutters
and iron bars.

678
01:59:51,022 --> 01:59:54,567
"We turned over cars in the streets,

679
01:59:55,068 --> 01:59:57,696
"tore off the miserable sign-boards,

680
01:59:57,862 --> 02:00:00,281
"destroyed the telephone center

681
02:00:00,448 --> 02:00:02,784
"because we saw the lights inside,

682
02:00:04,369 --> 02:00:08,039
"and we had the two post office girls

683
02:00:08,206 --> 02:00:10,250
"and we left only

684
02:00:10,417 --> 02:00:14,129
"when they had fainted
and like two used rags,

685
02:00:14,295 --> 02:00:16,631
"lifeless, hands clasped between knees,

686
02:00:17,382 --> 02:00:20,802
"hunched over,
they slipped off the bloody table..."

687
02:01:31,456 --> 02:01:33,249
- Hello there.
- Hello...

688
02:01:34,834 --> 02:01:36,628
- Doing okay?
- Fine.

689
02:01:36,795 --> 02:01:38,213
Just a moment...

690
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:45,595
Allow me to introduce

691
02:01:47,263 --> 02:01:49,182
Mrs. Eszter.

692
02:01:50,391 --> 02:01:51,935
Privilege, ma'am.

693
02:02:03,404 --> 02:02:04,614
Ma'am.

694
02:02:05,532 --> 02:02:08,159
Is this where you were thinking of?

695
02:02:12,455 --> 02:02:13,623
Here.

696
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:19,796
And if here?

697
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:24,676
Possible, but not really.

698
02:02:27,846 --> 02:02:29,013
And...

699
02:02:30,098 --> 02:02:32,517
what about here?

700
02:02:40,149 --> 02:02:41,651
Here!

701
02:02:44,612 --> 02:02:48,283
Then will you join us, ma'am? In the car?

702
02:02:49,909 --> 02:02:52,287
Yes. I'm coming.

703
02:02:56,249 --> 02:02:57,792
Follow us.

704
02:03:52,555 --> 02:03:58,561
FANTASTIC:
THE WORLD'S LARGEST GIANT WHALE!

705
02:03:58,728 --> 02:04:04,651
AND OTHER WONDERS OF NATURE!
GUEST STAR: THE PRINCE

706
02:05:24,313 --> 02:05:26,190
Uncle Lajos...

707
02:06:48,648 --> 02:06:50,566
- How's János?
- Good morning.

708
02:06:50,733 --> 02:06:52,860
You didn't see my Lajos?

709
02:06:55,571 --> 02:06:58,324
There's been no sign of him
since last night.

710
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:02,286
I saw him in the square last night.

711
02:07:02,453 --> 02:07:05,498
I'm sure he got mixed up somehow
in that ruction.

712
02:07:05,665 --> 02:07:08,000
He always has to be where he shouldn't.

713
02:07:08,167 --> 02:07:12,255
He'll never have any sense. He's always
poking his nose in everywhere.

714
02:07:12,421 --> 02:07:14,257
So are you, János.

715
02:07:14,423 --> 02:07:15,800
So are you.

716
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,302
They're looking for you as well.

717
02:07:18,469 --> 02:07:21,848
They came here
and I saw your name on the list.

718
02:07:22,014 --> 02:07:24,642
You'll hang for it in the end, János.

719
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:30,940
- I haven't done anything.
- That means nothing to them.

720
02:07:31,107 --> 02:07:33,609
They recognize neither man nor god.

721
02:07:33,776 --> 02:07:36,571
Get away from the town as soon as you can.

722
02:07:36,737 --> 02:07:40,283
Head for the rail tracks.
They're not being guarded.

723
02:07:40,449 --> 02:07:43,786
Try and hide somewhere,
and we'll see what happens.

724
02:07:44,287 --> 02:07:45,621
Got that?

725
02:07:48,583 --> 02:07:50,168
Yes, Aunt Harrer.

726
02:07:50,334 --> 02:07:54,755
If you see my Lajos,
tell him to come immediately.

727
02:07:55,298 --> 02:07:58,634
It's horrible here
and he's wandering about out there.

728
02:07:58,801 --> 02:08:00,595
And I've so much to do here.

729
02:08:02,555 --> 02:08:04,056
Goodbye, Aunt Harrer.

730
02:08:04,724 --> 02:08:06,726
Take care of yourself.

731
02:08:32,043 --> 02:08:37,048
LAJOS HARRER Jr.
BOOT AND SHOEMAKER

732
02:13:08,986 --> 02:13:11,655
I've made a place for you.

733
02:13:14,283 --> 02:13:16,660
You'll see it if you come out.

734
02:13:19,872 --> 02:13:22,208
I'm living in the summer kitchen.

735
02:13:23,626 --> 02:13:25,836
Because that woman...

736
02:13:26,003 --> 02:13:30,132
and the police chief have taken it
on themselves to move in

737
02:13:30,299 --> 02:13:32,551
and have taken the whole place over.

738
02:13:36,055 --> 02:13:39,350
But we'll get by all right
with the summer kitchen outside.

739
02:13:41,936 --> 02:13:46,357
The sofa with the green blanket
will be yours.

740
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:50,194
In the top part of the cupboard

741
02:13:50,778 --> 02:13:52,905
I'll make some space for you.

742
02:13:56,158 --> 02:13:58,536
The windows will have to be done.

743
02:13:59,036 --> 02:14:00,788
There are drafts

744
02:14:00,955 --> 02:14:02,498
and it's cold.

745
02:14:04,959 --> 02:14:08,003
I'm sleeping there for the second day now.

746
02:14:09,838 --> 02:14:12,424
And, thank God, out there

747
02:14:13,133 --> 02:14:15,177
you can't hear a thing.

748
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:18,013
Absolute silence.

749
02:14:22,768 --> 02:14:24,895
I've retuned the piano.

750
02:14:25,938 --> 02:14:29,316
Now, once again, it's like any other.

751
02:14:30,901 --> 02:14:33,737
Once again, you can play anything on it.

752
02:14:36,699 --> 02:14:38,867
And if we run short of money,

753
02:14:39,785 --> 02:14:42,621
it's much easier this way.

754
02:14:48,586 --> 02:14:52,881
I took my gray overcoat over to Árgyelán.

755
02:14:54,216 --> 02:14:57,636
He promised he'd tailor it for you.

756
02:15:00,306 --> 02:15:02,182
Whenever you come out,

757
02:15:03,309 --> 02:15:05,102
it will be ready.

758
02:15:17,531 --> 02:15:19,325
Nothing counts.

759
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:23,746
Nothing counts at all.

760
02:15:47,311 --> 02:15:49,146
Take care of yourself.

761
02:15:50,606 --> 02:15:54,485
I am coming again tomorrow,
at the usual time.

762
02:16:25,349 --> 02:16:27,059
Take care of yourself.

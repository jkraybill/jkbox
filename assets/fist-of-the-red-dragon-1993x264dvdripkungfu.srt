00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:35,549
My son, this is a good deal. All he wants
is an apology. We don‘t have to pay anything.

335
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,555
| always say “sorry“ tojean.
It‘s no big deal. It‘s like acting.

336
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,558
Look, Father, you‘re already
an embarrassment to the family.

337
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,118
|f| submit to that too, people will say
the So family men are of no use.

338
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,131
— Think so?
— Yes, ofcourse!

339
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,133
— Then no apology.
— No way!

340
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,328
— No way!
— Ofcourse.

341
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,474
Master Wong, my son says he won‘t apologize,
but he will pay compensation.

342
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,977
But, Master, ifyour son doesn‘t come out
and apologize to people,

343
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,913
it may be difﬁcult for him
to stay in Fu Shen.

344
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,917
What? That was an accident!
You can‘t hold me responsible!

345
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,919
Don‘t you feel anything
for the dead and the dying?

346
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,420
Are you threatening me?

347
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,922
—This is no threat, pal!
— Calm down,young man!

348
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,687
— We can talk this over.
— You should learn to control your son!

349
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,762
— [ Groans]
—You asked forit.

350
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,497
What kind of teacher are you?
Can‘t your students ﬁght?

351
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,968
— You‘re too much!
— [ Both Grunting]

352
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,201
[Both Shouting]

353
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,079
— No, stop!
— Don‘t worry.

354
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,150
— My master‘s not gonna kill your son.
— No, my son might kill him!

355
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:48,054
Very good. Wong Fei Hong, the Tiger
ofCanton, is really as good as they say.

356
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,287
— [Wong] Who are you, sir?
— [Man] You fool! Knee/ down!

357
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,329
This is the 1 2th Prince here.

358
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,366
It‘s all right.
I came here especially to see So Chai.

359
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,334
I‘m sorry that we disturbed you.

360
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,904
Ah!
[Chuckling]

361
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,668
Your Highness, I‘m so honored byyour
presence here. They werejust fooling around.

362
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,677
— As you have business here, I won‘t delayyou.
—We||, thankyou.

363
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,839
— I‘ll talktoyou later.
— Well, let me see you out.

364
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,747
Well, Brother So,

365
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,581
since I last saw you in Peking
your kung fu has improved very considerably.

366
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,417
Thankyou, sir.
You ﬁatter me.

367
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,923
Look, I‘m sorry.
My son is too cocky.

368
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,927
But he‘s not a bad boy.
Just leave it to me. He‘ll apologize.

369
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,930
Your son is a very good ﬁghter,
but he‘s overconﬁdent.

370
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,432
I agree. I know that.
This way, sir.

371
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:33,403
So that’s what happened Your Highness.
Do you think / should be held responsible?

372
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,405
Mmm.

373
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,408
It seems that this Wong Fei Hong
is a very righteous man.

374
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,410
—Hmm?
-Oh?

375
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,414
— Why do you say that?
— He‘s asked you to apologize to the victims.

376
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,417
Well, ifhe was,
he should have intervened then.

377
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,182
I think he‘sjust using this incident
to gain credit for himself.

378
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,851
Well, not everybody is like you and me,
Brother So, because we‘re real.

379
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
But some want that fame
and they will go to any lengths.

380
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,090
Ah, that‘s why I admire you
so much, Your Highness.

381
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,065
And | feel the same foryou.

382
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,692
— Come, let‘s have a drink together.
— Hey, you know I don‘t drink.

383
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,706
— Ofcourse she is.
— You know I‘m very picky.

384
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:13,710
|f|‘m not satisﬁed with her,
Iwon‘t payyou, and I do mean that.

385
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,713
— Don‘t say I didn‘t warn you.
— I‘m sureyou‘ll like her.

386
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,340
— Sir, inside.
— Thankyou. Thankyou.

387
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,510
Uh, waiter!

389
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,823
So, where is she?
Come on. Show me.

390
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,895
There. The one reading the newspaper.
You see her?

391
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,264
Ah.
[Chuckling]

392
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,267
She must‘ve been brought up overseas.
She‘s dressed like one ofthem.

393
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,600
Oh, yes. She says she wants to know
what an arranged marriage is.

394
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,174
That‘s why she‘s agreed to come.

395
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,439
— Miss Yi?
— Madam Bo.

396
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,446
I‘m so sorry we‘re late.
We were held up in trafﬁc.

397
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,642
It‘s true. I‘m sorry.
Shouldn‘t keep a lady waiting.

398
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,844
How are you today?

399
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,290
Uh, I‘m very sorry.

400
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,295
Madam Bo, this girl
doesn‘t seem very polite.

401
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,299
— She‘s asking me how I‘m going to die!
— Maybe we misheard her.

402
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,461
Try saying something.
Go on, see. Try it. Go on.

403
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,005
All right. How do you do?

404

How do you do?
[Chuckling]

405
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,010

656
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,194
Even Wong Fei Hong
doesn‘t have the guts to try it.

657
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,197
Well, Wong Fei Hong is scared,
but it doesn‘t mean I am too.

658
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,859
Okay, I‘ll try it, Your Highness.

659
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,936
That‘s more like it.

660
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,908
[Coughing]

661
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,637
How do you feel?

662
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,045
Fine.Just ﬁne.

663

[Chuckles]

664
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,185
People say...

665
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,782
that opium must be banned.

666
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,090
Wong Fei Hong has even
opened up a stop—smoking class.

667
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,096
He doesn‘t know anything.

668
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,166
Come, have another pipe.
Come on.

669
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,403
All right.

670
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,504

671
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,467
Come along come along!

This is your chance ofa lifetime!
Come along!

673
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,015
Five days in the stop—smoking class,
you‘ll get 15 coppers.

674
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,018
Hurry up and enroll.
Fifteen coppers from the clinic.

675
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,021
So putyour name down
for the stop—smoking class.

676
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,023
— Excuse me, madam.
—What is it?

677
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,958
— Would you like to earn some extra money?
— I‘m not into that.

678
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,963
You‘re not an addict, but maybe your man is.
Men are easily seduced.

679
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,966
They fall deep, and they lose
their body and soul to the opium.

680
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,969
— Would you give your body to seduction?
— [Chuckles] Not you.

681
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,505
— Huh!
—We||——

682
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,506
No, please!
You must stop smoking!

683
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,941
No, I won‘t do it!
I‘d rather take the anti—opium pills!

684
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,445
Hey, those pills are no use.

685
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:27,382
All right, I‘ll give you 20 coppers.
Huh? Okay?

686
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,885
— Now go back to class.
— No, I won‘t go back in there!

687
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,889
— No more smoking! No! Come on!

What do you want? Making more trouble?

I know whatyou‘re doing.
All this is to make a name foryour clinic.

691
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,466
— He doesn‘t want it. Let him go.
— You can go to hell.

00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,792
Teacher, it‘s So Chai.
He‘s making trouble.

700
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,131
Master Wong, what are you doing?

701
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,467
— A Chinese sauna?
— You‘re wrong.

702
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:25,474
That steam bath will help them to clear out
their poisoned systems ofthe toxins.

703
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,340
Have you smoked it?
Well, I have.

704
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:32,109
You know, a man ofstrong will
does not get hooked.

705
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,117
These people will smoke again
once they‘re out. This is useless.

706
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,620
— Who do you thinkyou are? Why don‘t you——
— Kwan!

707
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,623
Ifthey don‘t kick the habit,

708
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,625
there‘s no future for them, Chai.

709
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,627
It‘s a good thing to try and help,

710
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,959
but then you must
consider the consequences.

711
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,465
Otherwise, you‘ll do
more harm than good.

712
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,967
But what you‘re doing is no use,

713
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,334
and the consequences ofyour action
is to lose your clinic.

714
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:57,237
Chai, please don‘t push me too far.

715
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,775
— We‘re busy. Have a good day.
— Get out!

716
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,504
I‘ll go when they go.

717
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,807

Thankyou, Brother Kwan,
for holding my boots.

Who‘s holding whose boots?

— Forget it, Kwan.

00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:07,384
—I haven‘t seen her.
- Oh.

824
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:10,248
But don‘t worry.
I‘m sure she‘s okay.

825
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,083
[Groans]

826
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,157
It hurts?

827
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,665
Have a pipe.
It‘ll take the pain away, you see.

828
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,834
Go on. It‘s all right.

829
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,706
Now, how do you feel?

830
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,785
Isn‘t that better?

831
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,697
He‘s now in a daze.

832
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,699
You ﬁnd Kiki.
But don‘t hurt her.

833
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,201
Idon‘t want problems
with my brother.

834
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:03,364
— When he‘s addicted, he can kill Lin.
— That‘s clever, my lord.

835
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:05,601
Hmm.

836
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:10,108
| see.
You‘re looking for So Chai.

837
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,148
My lord, do you know
his whereabouts?

838
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,351
Master Wong, I know So Chai,

839
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,387
but I‘m not his nanny.

840
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:22,949
But, sir, Kiki said she saw you last night.
You were both seen together.

841
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,824
[Chuckles]
I was at Madam Chung‘s last night.

842
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,830
I was there the whole time,
but I never saw So Chai.

843
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:33,232
Look, Uncle, I don‘t care what you do.
I‘m not interested.

844
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,305
But I have to help So Chai.

845
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,670
Kiki, you‘re too suspicious.

846
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,678
Chai wouldn‘t go to a brothel.

847
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,680
Besides,you‘re a Manchu princess.

848
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,682
You can‘t marry a Han.

849
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,150
And yet you‘ve disregarded that law.

850
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,517
— You hang out with these peasants.
— That‘s not true!

851
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,989
I‘m sorry, sir.
Maybe this is not a good time.

852
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:57,185
Sorry to have disturbed you.
We‘ll go now.

853
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,194
Wait! You can‘t leave.

854
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,196
Mmm.

855
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,131
Wong Fei Hong,
you can‘tjust walk out.

856
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,794
I‘ll lose face.
I‘m sure you understand.

857
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:10,567
My lord, I‘m just concerned
about a friend‘s safety.

858
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:13,074
Hmm?|‘lltellyouwhat.

859
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,577
I heard that your kung fu is good.

860
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,079
|fyou can beat me,
then you‘re free to go.

861
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,616
But ifyou lose,
then you leave your head.

862
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,698
Haah!

863
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,321
— You‘re good.
— Huh? Hee—yaah!

864
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,261
My lord!

865
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,563
Lin Ze Xu pays his respects.

866
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,605
Save it!

867
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,675
See him out!

868
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,478
Your Honor——

869
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:27,847
Local ofﬁcials complain
that you‘ve totally disrupted life here.

870
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,852
The foreign minister thinks
you‘re ruthless with foreign traders.

871
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,515
So what do you have to say, Master Lin?
This could cost you dearly.

872
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:40,086
My lord, all I can say is, everything
I‘m doing is for the good ofthe country.

873
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,098
I‘ve vowed to destroy opium,
no matter what it costs.

874
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,660
Master Lin, you don‘t seem to have
a grasp ofthe situation at all.

875
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,605
Under the circumstances,

876
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,267
maybe you should leave,
retire early...

877
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,901
and leave
the serious business to us.

878
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,039
|wi|l never quit
as long as opium exists.

879
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,983
I‘m not somebody
who will give up halﬁivay.

880
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,986
Right. The policy‘s changed.

881
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,989
Just to let you know,
I‘ve ﬁled papers with His Majesty...

882
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,991
to impose heavy taxes on opium.

883
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,561
So when people run out ofmoney,
then theywill quit.

884
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:15,894
Your Highness,
that‘s not the answer to the problem.

885
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,899
We have to ban opium imports,

886
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,902
or China will become
a nation ofdrug addicts.

887
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,906
Hmph! I smoke too.
What do you plan on doing about that?

888
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,844
What I‘m after, sir, are merchants
who have large quantities.

889
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,848
You‘re treading on thin ice.

890
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,850
[Laughing]

891
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:38,581
Here‘s a word ofadvice foryou:
keep out ofit.

892
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,858
Brother So.

893
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,064
I found Kiki, but she spends all her time
with Wong Fei Hong these days.

894
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:59,802
Kiki is still veryyoung.
She is very naive.

895
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,936
/’m aﬁaid she ’ll be
taken in b ys weet talk

896
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,946
I regret I didn‘t believe you.

897
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,948
This Wong Fei Hong...

898
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,917
is a real hypocrite, as you say.

899
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,921
Now he‘s using Lin and the opium ban
to blackmail me.

900
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:16,925
He and the commissioner
are demanding a lot ofmoney from me.

901
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:20,428
They‘ve even ganged up with local bandits
who give them support openly.

902
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,522
Sooner or/ater,
these gangsters will ruin the country.

903
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:27,797
[Thinking]
Wong Fei Hong. Lin Ze Xu.

904
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,213
— First we must cut offtheir head.
— [Chuckles]

905
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,979
You‘re a very good chess player as well.
I admit my defeat.

906
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:46,879
[Yelling]

907
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,719
— Call the guards!
— Hyah!

908
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,305
Hyah!

909
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,509
[Groaning]

910
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,854
Chai!

911
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:24,120
— You okay, sir?
— I‘m okay. You can all leave now.

912
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,525
— [Men]Sir!
— He seems heavily addicted.

913
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:29,861
[ Wong] Chai was just being used
Master [in won ’t blame him.

914
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:40,271
Master Wong, how‘s my son?

915
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:42,538
Listen.

916
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:46,104
You mustn‘t blame your son.
He‘s heavily addicted to opium.

917
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:50,550
— Then what shall I do?
— You better move all the furniture away.

918
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:55,751
In the meantime, I‘ll go to Korea House and
try to get a ginseng to make a tonic for him.

919
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:59,625
— See you later.
— Oh, thankyou so much. Thankyou, sir.

920
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,629
[Sighs]

921
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,029
Hey! Don‘tjust
stand there like lumps!

922
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:06,694
Didn‘t you hear what he said?
Move the furniture!

923
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:17,343
[Groaning]

924
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,972
Father! Let me out!

925
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,711
Let me out!
I need opium!

926
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,083
/ need a smoke!

927
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:28,385
Father, let me out!
I need opium!

928
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:32,155
L et me out!
/ need a smoke!

929
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:35,322
Father! [Groans]
Let me out!

930
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:38,890
Son,just hang in there.

931
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:43,837
— / need opium! L et me out!
— I can‘t.

932
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,933
Don‘t worry.
Master Wong will help you.

933
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,740
Wow!
This is a magniﬁcent place.

934
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,442
[Together]
Please take a seat.

935
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:57,213
— Thankyou.
— [Chuckles]

936
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,154
Oh, it‘s a real pleasure to meet you,
Master Wong.

937
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,227
— Please sit down, won‘t you?
— Please.

938
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:09,293
—Oh, this looks good.
— Mr. Kim.

939
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:12,664
— Ow!
— I‘ve come here, good sir,

940
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,897
to askyou to sell me your
1,000—year—old ginseng to help a friend.

941
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:20,033
Huh! I‘ve heard that opium
is a health drug.

942
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:24,239
It brings people longevity.
My ginseng has no value in comparison.

943
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,838
You must bejoking, Mr. Kim.

944
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,510
Opium is poisoning all China.

945
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:33,146
Your ginseng can save thousands oflives,
so please help us out.

946
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:37,886
Have you eaten yet, Mr. Wong?
|fnot, then pleasejoin us, would you?

947
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:45,562
I thought maybe that you‘d like
a taste ofthis ginseng.

948
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,670
Hmm!

949
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,933
[Grunting]
Wow!

950
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,843
Oh. We can cut it up.
Can we have a knife or something?

951
01:01:56,947 --> 01:02:01,247
Huh! |fyou can‘t even solve that
little problem, you don‘t deserve it.

952
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:05,287
— You‘re trying to test us, is that it? You——
— Kwan!

953
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,754
Just be quiet.
Stand back!

954
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:13,326
Mr. Kim, I apologize for him.

955
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,368
Mr. Kim, let‘s drink to your health.

956
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,848
The ginseng is still raw and hard.

957
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:17,188
It needs some cooking to soften it.

958
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,271
— Have you heard oftae kwon do?
— Wait.

959
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,045
Careful!

960
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,985
Mr. Kim, thankyou.
You‘re good.

961
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:59,926
Your tiger and crane ﬁst, sir,
is really as good as people say.

962
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,430
I‘m very honored to have met
an unselﬁsh man likeyou.

963
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:08,334
— I‘m sure my ginseng will be put to good use.
—Thankyou very much, sir.

964
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,275
Do you know, wife,

965
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,277
since| married intoyourfamily,

966
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,906
my only contribution is our son.

967
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,646
| feel so useless.

968
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:29,248
I‘ve remained a widower
for almost 20 years.

969
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:33,261
Yes, everything
I‘ve done is for Chai.

970
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:37,857
| used to thinkthat I could
depend on him in my old age,

971
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,265
and now he ’s become
a drug addict

972
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:44,739
It hurts me so much to see him suﬁ‘er,
trying to quit, and it’s all my fault

973
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:46,968
| spoiled him rotten.

974
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:51,206
It‘s nothing to do with the Sos.

975
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:55,910
I‘m responsible.
Ifthere is blame, then it‘s with me!

976
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,812
— Uh, Master Wong——
— Get away! Leave me alone!

977
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,016
— Oh, please don‘t make it hard for him!
— Get out of my way now!

978
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:05,060
[Chattering]

979
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:12,495
-Chai?Chai?
— Missus? Missus?Young master‘s gone out.

980
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:15,503
What‘s wrong with you people?
I told you to watch him!

981
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:18,597
— He beats us up. What can we do?
— You‘re useless!

982
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,074
— What‘s up?
— Young master‘s gone out.

983
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,635
— Huh?
— You! Don‘t stand there looking like an idiot!

984
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:28,183
Go out and ﬁnd him,
and don‘t you come back until you have!

985
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:31,515
Ohh, I understand.

986
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:35,557
You want your son to go away,
hopefully die ofdrug addiction.

987
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:39,287
Then you could get married again.

That‘s for the opium.
Find me afterwards.

1023

Your dad‘s a disgrace, and he married
into the Sos for their money.

1024

Now his son is even worse than him——
a co ward! You’re a total disgrace.

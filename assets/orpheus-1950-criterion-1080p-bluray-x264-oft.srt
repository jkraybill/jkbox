1
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:28,903
<i>The legend of Orpheus
is well-known.</i>

2
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:35,284
<i>In Greek mythology, Orpheus was
a troubadour from Thrace.</i>

3
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:38,788
<i>He charmed even the animals.</i>

4
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:43,834
<i>His songs diverted his attention
from his wife Wurydice.</i>

5
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:47,171
<i>Death took her away from him.</i>

6
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,674
<i>He descended
to the netherworld,</i>

7
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:52,635
<i>and used his charm
to win permission</i>

8
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:54,428
<i>to return with Wurydice
to the world of the living</i>

9
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:58,224
<i>on the condition
that he never look at her.</i>

10
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,559
<i>But he looked at her</i>

11
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:04,689
<i>and was torn to pieces
by the Bacchantes.</i>

12
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,025
<i>Where does our story
take place...</i>

13
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,778
<i>and when?</i>

14
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:15,491
<i>A legend is entitled to be
beyond time and place.</i>

15
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,285
<i>Interpret it as you wish...</i>

16
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:57,450
The day I have a car like that
I'll have to have a lot of money.

17
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:06,876
Heurtebise, help Cegeste
across the square.

18
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,505
I'm not drunk!

19
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:13,466
Yes, you are.

20
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:44,371
Orpheus!

21
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,919
- Greetings!
- Are you crazy?

22
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:54,673
Sit down for a minute.

23
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:59,136
- I've driven everyone away.
- You've entered the lion's den.

24
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,806
I wanted to find out --

25
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:05,893
- What will you have to drink?
- Nothing, thanks. I had a drink.

26
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:08,479
It was rather bitter.

27
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:11,190
You're brave to speak to me.

28
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:14,527
I'm no longer in the battle.

29
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,364
I gave up writing at 20.
I had nothing new to say.

30
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:20,574
They respect my silence.

31
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:23,828
No doubt they think
I have nothing new to say,

32
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:27,289
and that a poet
should not be too famous.

33
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:30,251
They're not very fond of you.

34
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:33,170
Actually, they hate me.

35
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:56,652
Who's the not very amiable
young drunkard

36
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:58,112
who doesn't seem to be
averse to luxury?

37
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:01,574
That is Jacques Cegeste.
A poet.

38
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,577
He's 18 years old
and adored by all.

39
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:07,246
His companion, the princess,
finances the review

40
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,832
that published his first poems.

41
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:13,252
The princess is very beautiful
and very elegant.

42
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,463
She's not from here,
but she needs to be among us.

43
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,674
Here is her review.

44
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:22,887
Every page is blank!

45
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,598
It's called "Nudism."

46
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,225
It's absurd.

47
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,979
Less absurd than if it were
full of absurd writing.

48
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,648
No excess is absurd.

49
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:38,611
Orpheus, your gravest fault

50
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:42,156
is knowing just how far
to go too far.

51
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,408
The public loves me.

52
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,620
The public is alone.

53
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,166
They're talking about us.

54
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,376
It seems they change everything
and publish texts.

55
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,170
I have his poems.

56
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:59,965
Hold on to them. In his current state
he's apt to leave them anywhere.

57
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:02,009
Give them back!

58
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:04,678
I'll kick your ass!

59
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:06,639
I'll kick your ass!

60
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,600
Will you calm down?
I hate scenes.

61
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,352
Of course.

62
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:32,831
Police?

63
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:36,460
The Poets' Cafe.
There's a brawl.

64
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,139
Good-bye.

65
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,600
Your cafe amuses me.

66
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,560
It thinks it's the center
of the universe.

67
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:55,145
It is.

68
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,357
You know it,
and it hurts you.

69
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:02,027
Is my case hopeless?

70
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:05,239
No. If it were,
they wouldn't hate you.

71
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,242
What should I do?

72
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:10,285
Join in the battle?

73
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,748
Surprise us.

74
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,126
Your identification.

75
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:08,177
My apologies, sir.
I didn't recognize you,

76
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:11,472
though my wife's room
is full of portraits of you.

77
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,600
- The gentleman is with me.
- My apologies once again.

78
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,563
You're in too well
with the police.

79
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,983
- Me?
- I advise you to disappear.

80
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,819
You might be blamed
for this unpleasantness.

81
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,072
That's too much!

82
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,407
Let me go!

83
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:32,284
You have no right
to treat him like this!

84
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,745
- He has no identification.
- I vouch for him.

85
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,747
- You can explain it at the station.
- This is outrageous!

86
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,332
We're just doing our job.

87
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:41,085
Let me go!

88
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,796
Scum! Swine!

89
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,548
Let me go!

90
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:51,053
- The little bastard bit me!
- Watch out!

91
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,439
- Get the license numbers.
- We couldn't see them.

92
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:03,857
Put the other units on alert.

93
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:13,826
Put him in my car and take care
of this pathetic crowd.

94
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,876
Heurtebise, help them.

95
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,923
And to think it happened here,
where no one even passes through!

96
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:36,598
Don't stand there
like a lamppost.

97
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:40,435
Yes, you!

98
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,229
Make yourself useful.

99
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:49,111
I need you as a witness.
Get in. Quick!

100
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:07,880
Give me your handkerchief.

101
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,300
He looks badly wounded.

102
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,388
Don't make useless remarks.

103
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,684
The hospital is behind us.

104
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,896
You don't think I'd take
this child to a hospital.

105
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:30,944
Don't touch him!

106
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:33,780
But...

107
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,117
this young man is dead.

108
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:39,995
Will you mind
your own business?

109
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:42,623
When will you stop meddling
in other people's business?

110
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,167
It was you who told me
to come with you.

111
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,172
Will you please be quiet?

112
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:22,079
Take the usual route.

113
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:27,376
The radio.

114
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,133
<i>Silence</i>

115
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,136
<i>goes faster backwards.</i>

116
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,055
<i>Three times.</i>

117
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,603
<i>I repeat.</i>

118
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,152
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

119
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:58,282
<i>A single glass of water
lights up the world.</i>

120
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:01,785
- Where are we going?
- Must I force you to be quiet?

121
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:05,247
<i>A single glass of water
lights the world.</i>

122
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,292
<i>Twice. I repeat.</i>

123
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,223
Hello there!

124
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,402
But... those are the men
who knocked this boy down.

125
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:37,362
You're being stupid.

126
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,073
Please, stop asking questions.

127
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:28,622
Get out and let my men handle this.

128
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,045
Take the body out of the car
and take it upstairs.

129
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,209
Are you sleepwalking?

130
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,256
I must be.

131
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,436
Everyone is dawdling.
I don't like this dawdling.

132
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,440
Wait for me here, sir.

133
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,290
Lay him on the floor.

134
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,923
Follow me.

135
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:06,052
You're clearly asleep.

136
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,849
Yes, I'm asleep.

137
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,310
It's very strange.

138
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:18,356
- You must explain --
- No, I won't.

139
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:22,736
Sleeping or dreaming,
the dreamer must accept his dreams.

140
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:25,155
I have a right
to ask for an explanation.

141
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:27,991
You have every right, my dear man,
and so do I...

142
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,951
so we're even.

143
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,037
Turn off that music!

144
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,459
There's a dead man in the next room
and the men who killed him.

145
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,171
- I repeat... I demand --
- And I demand you not touch that radio!

146
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:44,841
<i>- Message: The mirrors would do well...</i>
- Calm down and have a seat.

147
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:47,469
<i>To reflect further.</i>

148
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,472
<i>Three times.</i>

149
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,813
You're unbearable.

150
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,526
Sit down.

151
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:05,111
Wait for me in this room.

152
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,948
My servants will bring you
some champagne and cigarettes.

153
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:09,866
Make yourself at home.

154
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:14,871
You try too hard to understand
what's going on, my dear young man,

155
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,498
and that's a serious mistake.

156
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:19,209
But they expect me at home.

157
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,753
Let your wife wait.

158
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,923
She'll be all the more pleased
when you return.

159
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:40,313
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

160
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,279
Cegeste, get up.

161
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,242
Hello.

162
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:53,743
Hello.

163
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:56,288
- Do you know who I am?
- I do.

164
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,165
- Say it.
- You are my Death.

165
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:02,586
Good.
From now on you will serve me.

166
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:04,379
I will serve you.

167
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:07,841
- You will obey my orders.
- I will obey your orders.

168
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,593
Excellent.

169
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,720
Now, come with me.

170
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,681
Hold on to my dress.

171
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:17,434
Do not be afraid.
Don't let go.

172
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,304
Where are we?

173
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:23,643
- I said, "Where are we?"
- I don't know.

174
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:25,186
I'm supposed to wait for you
and take you back.

175
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,397
Where is the princess?
Where is the villa?

176
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,066
Sir, if you will kindly
get in the car --

177
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,546
Yes, yes!

178
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,923
The woman was staying
at the Hôtel des Thermes.

179
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,675
Call the manager for me.

180
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:57,802
They want to speak
to the manager.

181
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,851
Yes, Hôtel des Thermes... Hello?

182
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,936
This is the chief inspector speaking.

183
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,813
I'm sorry to trouble you again.

184
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,149
<i>Have you conducted
your investigation?</i>

185
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,318
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

186
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,697
I can only repeat
what I've told you, Inspector.

187
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:20,450
There is no woman here
fitting that description,

188
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,327
nor have I seen any Rolls-Royces.

189
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,954
I'll drop by at 2:00. Forgive me.

190
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:29,334
It's unbelievable.

191
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:35,215
Not at the Thermes,
not at the Fabius,

192
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,259
and not at the Hôtel des Deux Mondes.

193
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:41,930
He'll never come back.

194
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:44,265
There, there, calm down.

195
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,184
Men always come back.

196
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,520
They're so absurd!

197
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:51,231
But where is he?
Where can he be?

198
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:54,567
There's no point in lying to you.
He's with that woman.

199
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:56,653
No, no! I don't believe it!

200
00:21:56,736 --> 00:22:00,406
Inspector, tell her it's not true.
You know Orpheus!

201
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,828
- Tell her it's not true.
- It's difficult to say.

202
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:08,748
Yours is a perfect marriage,
but sometimes men lose their heads.

203
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,342
- It's a messy story.
- Will the press create a scandal?

204
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,345
No, I gave strict orders.

205
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:25,139
Besides, the reporters
don't know anything yet.

206
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:39,320
- It's a reporter, Inspector.
- What?

207
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:41,614
What is it?

208
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:53,209
I've been sent by the <i>Sun.</i>
Is your husband in?

209
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:55,545
My husband can't be disturbed.
He's sleeping.

210
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:56,838
Is that so?

211
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,381
He worked all night.

212
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,467
I came by to see him,
but I didn't want to disturb him.

213
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:04,470
Fine. I'll go then. Can I drop you off
somewhere, Inspector?

214
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:07,181
- Not necessary. I have my car.
- What was it you wanted?

215
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:09,225
I wanted to talk to him
about the accident.

216
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,061
The young man is not at the hospital,
and his friends are concerned.

217
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:14,898
Everything's fine.
I'll stop by your office.

218
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,116
Well done!

219
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:27,577
This is terrible!

220
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,080
Let's not panic.

221
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:33,416
I'll stop by the office
and speak with them.

222
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,168
Come now. Be strong.

223
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:53,019
Follow me,
and be as quiet as possible.

224
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,274
I'll open the garage.

225
00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:32,600
Then it's agreed?

226
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,187
My wife would never understand.

227
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,989
I'm a reporter from the <i>Sun.</i>

228
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:47,657
So you're asleep, huh?

229
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:50,910
I'll let you sleep on, Orpheus.
Pleasant dreams!

230
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:52,286
Get out of here!

231
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,455
My newspaper will take
your attitude into account.

232
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:55,999
Clear out.

233
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:59,335
- You'll regret this!
- To hell with the press!

234
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,587
- That's something new.
- Yes, it's new.

235
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,340
Eurydice, he's back!

236
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,806
- What are you doing here?
- Charming!

237
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,559
Orpheus, if you abandon your wife,
it's only normal

238
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,061
that she should call on those
who love her.

239
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:20,440
I was frantic with worry.
I called Aglaonice.

240
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:22,650
And the inspector?

241
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:25,528
I don't think you realize
how serious the situation is.

242
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,780
What I realize is that I come home
and find the police

243
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:30,158
and a woman whom I've forbidden
to ever enter my house!

244
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:33,703
You've gone too far
with your bad manners.

245
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:35,788
You'll live to regret
those words!

246
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:39,625
Coming, Inspector?

247
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:42,003
You seem as unwelcome
as I am.

248
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:44,297
Go on.
I'm not holding you back.

249
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:47,675
You're to come to my office tomorrow.

250
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,143
Aglaonice is dangerous!

251
00:25:57,226 --> 00:25:59,645
Her League of Women is powerful.
You're crazy!

252
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:03,149
Perhaps I am <i>going</i> mad.

253
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:06,027
- Where were you?
- Oh, no! Not that!

254
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,199
No cross-examinations, please!

255
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:14,368
But you've never stayed out all night.
It's only natural that I ask you --

256
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,288
Nothing!
Ask me nothing!

257
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:21,584
Orpheus, you never drink!

258
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,170
I do now! Do you mind?

259
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:30,760
And here I was waiting
for you to come home

260
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:35,765
to tell you some great news!

261
00:26:35,848 --> 00:26:38,184
I don't want to hear
any more stories!

262
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,437
I especially don't want to hear
any news!

263
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:44,315
The news I get is always bad news,
and I'm tired of it!

264
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:47,110
Leave me alone.
I want to sleep!

265
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:49,237
Sleep!

266
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:39,036
- Who are you?
- I brought your husband back.

267
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:41,998
Where was he?

268
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:44,750
I'm the chauffeur for the woman
whose car he got in yesterday.

269
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,544
Did he spend the night with her?

270
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:48,379
No, ma'am.

271
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:50,506
My employer was transporting
a badly wounded man.

272
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,925
Your husband was at the scene
and got in the car.

273
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,971
But my boss doesn't like
people meddling in her affairs.

274
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,015
And so?

275
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,809
She left us on the road.

276
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:05,021
She had a small car waiting for her
near her villa.

277
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:07,064
She drove off on her own
with the wounded man.

278
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:08,858
And my husband?

279
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,152
I had a problem with the ignition.

280
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,154
It was better to wait till day.

281
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,615
Your husband slept in the car.

282
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,159
He was very worried
about you.

283
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:20,995
I'd like to believe it.

284
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,750
I might lie to you if I were
a real chauffeur, but I'm not.

285
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,544
- What are you?
- A student -- without a penny.

286
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:31,464
I only got the job two weeks ago.

287
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,841
My name is Heurtebise.

288
00:28:34,508 --> 00:28:36,719
You make me feel better.

289
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:40,181
- Do you know my husband?
- Who doesn't?

290
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:43,434
My husband adores me...
and now we've had a fight.

291
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:46,562
He's not himself.
He's been drinking.

292
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,110
You dropped your work.

293
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,615
I was going to tell him
the big news.

294
00:28:57,698 --> 00:29:00,826
He wouldn't listen.
He saw nothing and heard nothing.

295
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:03,496
He stepped right on it
without even noticing.

296
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:06,832
He's tired.
It's hard to sleep in a car.

297
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:10,795
Perhaps it's that.
He said he wanted to sleep.

298
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:14,048
But you must be exhausted.

299
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:16,425
I'll make you some coffee.

300
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:21,472
Where are you supposed to meet
your employer?

301
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:23,933
Forgive me -- this "lady."

302
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,310
Sit down.

303
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,438
I have no orders.

304
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:31,774
I'll wait for her in town.

305
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,609
Stay here if you like.

306
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:36,404
There's a little room
above the garage.

307
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,656
It's not much,
I'm warning you,

308
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:42,368
but you can park your car
next to ours and wait.

309
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:44,745
Tell the truth.

310
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:48,582
You want me under your thumb
because I'm part of the story.

311
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,669
Nevertheless,
you are charming.

312
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:55,089
You're wrong.
I'm very ordinary.

313
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,637
You must realize
that women like me

314
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,973
have much to fear
from certain people.

315
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:06,934
Your husband wouldn't
lose his head easily.

316
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:10,396
He's very handsome
and very famous.

317
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:13,733
It's a miracle
that he's still faithful to me.

318
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,694
The water!

319
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:27,913
- Please, forgive me.
- The gas!

320
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:32,585
- What about it?
- It's still on. Be careful.

321
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,464
I dislike that smell...

322
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:38,049
and for good reason.

323
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:41,635
I committed suicide
by gassing myself.

324
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:43,929
Since my death,
the smell has pursued me.

325
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:45,431
Your death?

326
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:49,393
I mean...
since I almost committed suicide.

327
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:51,687
You don't look like a ghost.

328
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:55,107
I was in love with a girl.
She was quite ugly.

329
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,778
It's a pity she wasn't like you.

330
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:03,324
- Your name is Eurydice, is it not?
- At your service.

331
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:05,493
But I've forgotten yours.

332
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:07,828
Heurtebise, at your service.

333
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:08,287
<i>The bird sings with its fingers.</i>

334
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:11,624
<i>The bird sings with its fingers.</i>

335
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,376
<i>Once.</i>

336
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:14,919
<i>I repeat.</i>

337
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,550
<i>And that first night</i>

338
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:06,429
<i>Orpheus' Death
entered his room</i>

339
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,722
<i>and watched him sleep.</i>

340
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:34,206
<i>Two days later...</i>

341
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,543
There are other radios
besides this one.

342
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,253
I can't get this station
anywhere else.

343
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,797
So I have to live in this car
to spend time with you?

344
00:32:41,881 --> 00:32:44,758
- Nobody's forcing you!
- Darling --

345
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,595
<i>38...</i>

346
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,139
<i>39...</i>

347
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:52,224
<i>40.</i>

348
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:54,143
<i>Twice.</i>

349
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:55,811
<i>I repeat.</i>

350
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:08,616
Seems like nothing
but meaningless words to me.

351
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,243
But there was
a terrific message yesterday.

352
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:12,870
Rest awhile.

353
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:15,581
So the messages can start again
as soon as I turn my back? Thanks.

354
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:19,043
You can't spend your life
in a talking car.

355
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,379
- It makes no sense.
- No sense?

356
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,258
My life had begun to pass
its peak.

357
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:30,012
It was rotting,
stinking of success and of death.

358
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:33,766
The least of these phrases
is much more than any of my poems.

359
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:37,895
I'd give all that I've written
for even one of those little phrases.

360
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,148
I'm on the trail of the unknown.

361
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:45,444
Orpheus, little phrases
won't feed our child.

362
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:48,155
There's a woman for you,
Heurtebise.

363
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:50,699
You discover a world

364
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:53,452
and she speaks to you
of baby clothes and bills.

365
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:57,081
I admire Orpheus.

366
00:33:57,164 --> 00:34:00,834
I could have listened a thousand times
and not paid the slightest attention.

367
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,463
Where could they be coming from,
Heurtebise?

368
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,007
They're on no other station.

369
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,052
I'm certain they're meant for me.

370
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:12,680
Orpheus, nothing matters
but this car.

371
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:14,932
I could die
and you wouldn't even notice.

372
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:17,977
We were dead
and we didn't notice.

373
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,813
Beware of the Sirens!

374
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:23,232
It is I who charm <i>them.</i>

375
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:25,359
Your voice is very beautiful.

376
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:27,236
Be satisfied with your voice.

377
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,030
<i>Attention.</i>

378
00:34:30,114 --> 00:34:33,075
<i>2,294. Twice.</i>

379
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,286
What fascinating poetry!

380
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,997
Who can say what's poetry
and what isn't?

381
00:34:38,414 --> 00:34:40,624
Besides, if you're not happy,
you don't have to stay.

382
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,002
I just want to be left
in peace, that's all.

383
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:46,255
Take her away.
She'll drive me mad.

384
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:48,424
That car will drive you mad.

385
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:51,510
Take her away, Heurtebise,
or I,II  do something I'll regret!

386
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,765
Orpheus was horrible.

387
00:34:56,849 --> 00:35:00,728
No, he's a genius,
and every genius has his moods.

388
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,816
It's not that talking car
that I fear.

389
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:07,318
It's what he's looking for.

390
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:09,361
But he'd be the same
with that woman.

391
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:11,655
All he's interested in
is those phrases.

392
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:15,284
Heurtebise, I may be foolish

393
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:17,328
but I feel things.

394
00:35:17,703 --> 00:35:20,289
It's the first time
he's treated me like a dog.

395
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:24,543
Don't exaggerate.
It's just a little family quarrel.

396
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:27,338
It starts with little family quarrels.

397
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:31,258
You're going to lie down
and close your eyes.

398
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:38,349
Would you answer it for me?

399
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,945
Yes, this is Orpheus' house.

400
00:35:52,071 --> 00:35:54,448
No, this is not Orpheus.

401
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:58,202
Yes, Inspector.

402
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:01,038
Yes, I'll give him your message.

403
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:11,507
The inspector called.
He's expecting you.

404
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,551
- And your wife doesn't feel well.
- It's natural in her condition.

405
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:18,097
- Go see her.
- All right. Would you get the car out?

406
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,015
- My car?
- No, mine.

407
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,559
No one must suspect
the other car is here.

408
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,645
The whole town knows that car.

409
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:43,038
What's wrong?

410
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:45,999
- Don't you feel well?
- Very well.

411
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:49,628
- Would you like me to get you a nurse?
- A nurse?

412
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:53,298
I can't leave you all alone.
I have to go into town.

413
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,884
I won't be alone.

414
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:58,429
Forgive my bad temper.

415
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,682
I've been resting
on my laurels.

416
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:03,559
I've got to wake up.

417
00:37:03,642 --> 00:37:05,686
Hurry home.

418
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,821
Do you forgive me?
I'm all nerves.

419
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:39,344
What is it?
Did I scare you?

420
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,848
I'm all on edge.
I couldn't drive.

421
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,058
Aren't you afraid they might
recognize me if I drive?

422
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:48,937
You can drop me off and wait somewhere
where no one will recognize you.

423
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,578
I'm going to police headquarters,
and then I'll be back.

424
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:07,581
One never knows if one will return
from police headquarters.

425
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:10,209
Very funny.

426
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:22,614
Excuse me. Have you seen
a dark-haired woman pass by?

427
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:43,510
Hello, Orpheus.
Hot under the collar?

428
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:47,055
Excuse me --

429
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:02,279
Have you seen a young woman
pass by?

430
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:04,406
Chasing girls, Orpheus?

431
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,909
She's very thin and very smart,
and she walks very fast.

432
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:08,660
That's me!

433
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,999
- Orpheus, your autograph, please.
- I don't have the time.

434
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:16,752
- Please, sign my book!
- I don't have anything to write with.

435
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:18,754
Monique, lend me your pen.

436
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:22,215
It's him, it's him!

437
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:29,389
Let me go!

438
00:40:32,476 --> 00:40:33,477
Idiot!

439
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:39,441
Over here! Come quick!

440
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:41,902
I see why he steers clear of us.
Read this.

441
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,996
Troubling article...

442
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:57,626
Speak one at a time
or we,II never get anywhere.

443
00:40:58,043 --> 00:41:02,673
You were saying, sir,
that this phrase is a poem.

444
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:07,761
No one should know
better than you.

445
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,763
Go ahead and speak.

446
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:13,058
Orpheus sent me the texts
yesterday morning.

447
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:15,560
I found them
quite astonishing.

448
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:18,146
I showed them
to my friends.

449
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,150
I noticed that one of them --
quite an astonishing one --

450
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:24,069
reminded me of something.

451
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:26,363
I believe this is the text.

452
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,491
"The bird sings with its fingers."

453
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:31,618
I quote without prejudice.

454
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:34,329
On the day of the accident,
the guy was smashed.

455
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:35,872
Are you speaking
of the victim?

456
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:38,125
Jacques Cegeste.
He Was to give us a poem.

457
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,795
<i>After the brawl, I found these pages
at The Poets' Cafe.</i>

458
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:44,756
He wrote the phrase
you have in your hand.

459
00:41:44,923 --> 00:41:47,300
Orpheus didn't know Cegeste.

460
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:50,262
He was sitting with me when he saw
Cegeste for the first time.

461
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:53,849
The young man disappears
under tragic circumstances,

462
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:57,185
and his poem comes back to us
through Orpheus, who was in the car

463
00:41:57,686 --> 00:42:00,063
and who claims he doesn't know
what became of Cegeste.

464
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:04,943
Madam, you run
a women's club, "The Bacchantes."

465
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,154
One can drink late
into the night there.

466
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:09,906
- Just champagne, Inspector.
- That's right.

467
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,491
What can you tell me?

468
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:14,411
Orpheus married
one of my former serving girls.

469
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,038
We're very fond of her.

470
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,623
When she's sad,
she comes to us.

471
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:21,668
She told us
she was very unhappy.

472
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,797
Ladies and gentlemen,
I don't doubt your good faith,

473
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,550
nor your wish to assist justice.

474
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:32,888
But this evidence is too flimsy
to accuse a national hero...

475
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:34,139
Orpheus!

476
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:38,477
Don't forget we call
a fanfare of trumpets

477
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,312
"Orphean music."

478
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:43,023
Ladies, gentlemen --

479
00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:46,068
To hell with national heroes!
We'll take care of justice ourselves!

480
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:50,447
I'm expecting Orpheus at any moment.
I'm sure he'll explain --

481
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,241
If justice refuses to intervene,
then we will.

482
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,035
Good-bye, Inspector.

483
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:57,329
Gentlemen, gentlemen!

484
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:05,003
Did you read the article?

485
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:08,799
- No, and I won't read it.
- Good choice. It's disgraceful.

486
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:11,051
Don't mention it to my wife.

487
00:43:11,134 --> 00:43:12,803
Did you see a lot of people?

488
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,682
It seemed to me that
the streets were oddly empty.

489
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:20,727
All I found were girls
asking for autographs.

490
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:23,939
- And you?
- No. Wait -- yes! My employer.

491
00:43:24,022 --> 00:43:25,524
She passed by in a convertible.

492
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:28,360
She slowed down and shouted to me
that the Rolls was fine at your place,

493
00:43:28,443 --> 00:43:29,945
and that I should wait for her.

494
00:43:30,028 --> 00:43:32,656
You should have gone after her,
shouted for her to stop.

495
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:36,785
A chauffeur doesn't give orders.
He only takes them.

496
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:38,620
Did she give you any orders?

497
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,872
No. She told me to wait for orders
at your place.

498
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:44,960
- What did the inspector tell you?
- I didn't go to see him. He can wait.

499
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:54,761
<i>Each night, Orpheus' Death</i>

500
00:43:54,845 --> 00:43:57,222
<i>returned to his room.</i>

501
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:05,355
- No, Eurydice, no!
- I must go, Heurtebise.

502
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,774
I'll go to Aglaonice.
I must!

503
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:09,818
She's the only one
who can advise me.

504
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:11,987
Orpheus would not like it!

505
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,322
He doesn't care about anything
but that woman's car.

506
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:18,410
Even if I drove you, he'd see you.
He's in the garage.

507
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:20,871
I'll take my bicycle.
I do it all the time.

508
00:44:20,954 --> 00:44:23,790
- In your condition it's crazy!
- I'm going!

509
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,505
I don't have the authority
to forbid you,

510
00:44:31,464 --> 00:44:33,258
but what if I begged you?

511
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:34,968
I'd still go.

512
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:37,637
It wouldn't stop me.
I'm going mad!

513
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,059
Aglaonice can't tell you
anything new

514
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:45,353
and you,II  be dead tired.

515
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,945
Hello.

516
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:41,618
Come along, Cegeste.
Get used to following me.

517
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:44,162
- Close the door.
- What door?

518
00:45:44,246 --> 00:45:47,040
The mirror! You never understand
what you're told.

519
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:53,588
The mirror and the trapdoor.

520
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,093
Is everything all right?

521
00:45:58,718 --> 00:46:00,428
That depends.

522
00:46:02,347 --> 00:46:04,891
What do you mean by that?

523
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:07,269
Nothing, ma'am.

524
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:09,229
Good.

525
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:12,190
I can't stand impertinence.

526
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:14,943
Is Orpheus in the garage?

527
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:16,903
Yes, ma'am.

528
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:21,449
Well, now, Cegeste,

529
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,077
what does that look mean?

530
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:28,164
Perhaps you expected to see me
with a scythe and a shroud?

531
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:33,670
My boy, if I appeared to the living
the way they portray me,

532
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:35,547
they would recognize me,

533
00:46:36,047 --> 00:46:38,383
and that wouldn't make
our work very easy.

534
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:42,429
Heurtebise will help you.
You'll never manage on your own.

535
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:46,308
I'll close the curtains myself
since none of you have bothered to.

536
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:50,895
Leave nothing on the table
except the transmitter.

537
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:53,732
Cegeste, send the messages.

538
00:46:53,982 --> 00:46:56,234
Come on, get a move on!

539
00:46:57,861 --> 00:47:00,196
Not drinking doesn't suit you.

540
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,240
I have no time to waste.

541
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:06,161
"A young widow’s mourning shroud

542
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:09,080
is as brief as a noonday candle."

543
00:47:09,164 --> 00:47:11,875
Once. I repeat.

544
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:21,426
Your phrases are an exquisite
stroke of inspiration.

545
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:25,388
Thank you.

546
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:29,225
- Where are my gloves?
- They're not in the bag.

547
00:47:30,602 --> 00:47:33,772
Did you forget them?
That's the last straw!

548
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:36,900
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

549
00:47:38,485 --> 00:47:41,196
I knew it.
Give me yours. Quickly!

550
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:46,326
You know I demand
absolute discipline

551
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:48,536
like on a ship.

552
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:57,462
Do you have orders?

553
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,175
What did you say?

554
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:05,428
I asked you
if you had orders.

555
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:10,225
When I carry out my orders,
I expect mine to be carried out.

556
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:12,769
That's exactly why I ask
if you have orders.

557
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:14,687
You dare to ask?

558
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:18,650
If you had had orders, your butchers
would have completed their task.

559
00:48:20,235 --> 00:48:22,654
Are you in love with this idiot?

560
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:25,198
What if I am?

561
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:28,159
You have no right to love
in <i>any</i> world.

562
00:48:28,243 --> 00:48:30,954
- Nor do you.
- What?

563
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:34,249
- You can't escape the rules.
- I order you to be quiet!

564
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:38,086
You're in love with Orpheus
and you don't know how to handle it.

565
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:40,130
Shut up!

566
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:44,050
Transmit your messages.

567
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:46,386
Make something up --
anything!

568
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:50,306
Could I appear and disappear
like Heurtebise?

569
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:52,851
You're too clumsy.
Transmit.

570
00:48:56,187 --> 00:48:58,773
"Jupiter gives wisdom

571
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:00,358
to those he would lose.

572
00:49:00,442 --> 00:49:01,860
I repeat."

573
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:08,700
Orpheus! Orpheus!

574
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:12,537
What?
Can't I ever be left alone?

575
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:15,248
Your wife is in great danger.

576
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:16,749
- Follow me.
- Be quiet!

577
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:19,502
I'm telling you,
your wife is in great danger.

578
00:49:19,586 --> 00:49:22,422
- I can't hear.
- Will you listen to me?

579
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:25,258
Let me finish writing this.

580
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,971
Orpheus, your wife is dying!

581
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:33,057
You don't know her.

582
00:49:33,141 --> 00:49:35,894
It's just a trick
to get me back in the house.

583
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,828
Get up.

584
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:11,179
Do you know who I am?

585
00:50:11,262 --> 00:50:13,306
- I do.
- Say it.

586
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:15,517
My Death.

587
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,269
From now on
you belong to the other world.

588
00:50:18,353 --> 00:50:20,855
From now on
I belong to the other world.

589
00:50:20,939 --> 00:50:24,234
- You will obey my orders.
- I will obey.

590
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:25,735
Excellent.

591
00:50:27,028 --> 00:50:28,780
Ah, there you are.

592
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:31,616
Orpheus must have refused
to follow you.

593
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,619
I will report this.

594
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:37,247
And so will I.

595
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,082
I have a lot to say.

596
00:50:42,377 --> 00:50:44,504
Don't forget the apparatus.
You forget everything!

597
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:48,841
I suppose, Heurtebise,
that you want to stay on Earth?

598
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,263
You look like a gravedigger
in that trapdoor.

599
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:56,057
You are quite ridiculous!

600
00:50:56,349 --> 00:50:58,351
I'm not the only one!

601
00:51:00,436 --> 00:51:02,814
I'll make a note
of your insolence.

602
00:51:04,983 --> 00:51:05,984
Cegeste!

603
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:10,488
Won't you ever learn
not to look back?

604
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:14,325
People have been turned
into a pillar of salt for that!

605
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:19,747
Let's go.

606
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:56,367
I warned you.
You're too late.

607
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:58,578
- Too late?
- Come up.

608
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:01,497
What are you doing
in my room?

609
00:52:02,123 --> 00:52:05,418
Come in through the window
you find so handy for climbing out.

610
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:17,513
I asked you
what you're doing in my room.

611
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:21,392
- Your wife.
- What about my wife?

612
00:52:22,185 --> 00:52:24,520
Your wife is dead.

613
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:26,564
Are you joking?

614
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:29,233
That would be
a strange joke.

615
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,404
You refused to listen to me.

616
00:52:38,743 --> 00:52:40,453
Eurydice.

617
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,288
Orpheus, listen to me.

618
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:50,088
It's too late for regrets.

619
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,048
Listen to me.

620
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:55,093
But how...

621
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:57,345
and why?

622
00:52:58,721 --> 00:53:00,973
She had a bad fall

623
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,477
and, I suspect,
other things as well.

624
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,230
What?

625
00:53:13,653 --> 00:53:15,571
It's not possible.

626
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:19,409
Talk to me.

627
00:53:20,118 --> 00:53:21,536
Look at me.

628
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:26,082
There's one way
to undo your foolishness.

629
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:31,671
This is part
of the same dream,

630
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,757
the same nightmare.

631
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:36,509
But I'll wake up --
Somebody wake me up!

632
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,469
Listen to me.

633
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:41,347
Will you listen to me,
Orpheus?

634
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:44,642
It's all useless.

635
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,311
You have one chance left.

636
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,480
What chance?

637
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:54,152
Orpheus, you know Death.

638
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:57,280
I've spoken of her...

639
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:59,407
I've dreamt of her...

640
00:54:00,408 --> 00:54:02,452
I've sung about her.

641
00:54:02,535 --> 00:54:05,204
I thought I knew her...

642
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:08,416
but I didn't know her.

643
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:12,128
You know her... in person!

644
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:15,423
In person?

645
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:18,342
You have been with her.

646
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:20,386
With her?

647
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,848
In her room.
In her very room!

648
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:27,268
- The princess?
- That's right.

649
00:54:28,144 --> 00:54:29,854
My God!

650
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:34,358
The mirror.

651
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,903
I'll give you
the secret of secrets.

652
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:40,406
Mirrors are the doors
through which Death comes and goes.

653
00:54:42,408 --> 00:54:45,244
Look at yourself in a mirror
all your life...

654
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,789
and you,II  see Death at work

655
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,666
like bees in a hive of glass.

656
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:59,675
How do you know
these frightening things?

657
00:55:00,468 --> 00:55:02,553
Don't be naive.

658
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:07,433
Could I be her chauffeur without
learning certain frightening things?

659
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:12,355
Heurtebise,
there's nothing more to be done.

660
00:55:13,064 --> 00:55:15,733
Yes, there is.
You must join her.

661
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,612
No man can do that

662
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:22,114
unless he kills himself.

663
00:55:22,198 --> 00:55:24,242
A poet is more than a man.

664
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,661
But my wife lies dead
there on her deathbed!

665
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:30,414
It's one of her forms,

666
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:32,667
as the princess is
one of Death's forms.

667
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,377
It's all false!

668
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:37,380
Your wife is
in another world.

669
00:55:37,463 --> 00:55:39,757
I invite you
to follow me there.

670
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:43,678
I would follow her to hell!

671
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:46,472
You needn't go that far.

672
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:53,271
I want to find Eurydice.

673
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:56,107
You don't need to beg.

674
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:58,609
I'm offering it to you.

675
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,611
Look into my eyes.

676
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,781
Is it Eurydice you wish to find,
or Death?

677
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:07,118
But...

678
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:10,204
I'm asking you very clearly:

679
00:56:10,955 --> 00:56:13,916
Is it Death you wish to find,
or Eurydice?

680
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:20,131
Both.

681
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:24,385
And, if you can,
betray one with the other?

682
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:26,262
Let's hurry!

683
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:32,184
I am proud to no longer be alive.

684
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:37,356
Someone left their gloves here.

685
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:40,526
- Gloves?
- Put them on.

686
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,114
Come on, put them on.

687
00:56:59,337 --> 00:57:02,298
With these gloves
you will pass through mirrors

688
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,175
as if they were water.

689
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:06,677
Prove it.

690
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:08,888
Try it.

691
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,973
I'll go with you.

692
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:14,018
Look at the time.

693
00:57:15,895 --> 00:57:17,688
Hands out in front.

694
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:30,242
Perhaps you're afraid?

695
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:34,538
But this mirror is a mirror,

696
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:38,000
and in it I see
an unhappy man.

697
00:57:38,084 --> 00:57:40,711
You do not have to understand.

698
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:43,673
You just have to believe.

699
00:59:04,879 --> 00:59:06,839
Where are we?

700
00:59:07,048 --> 00:59:09,759
Life is a long death...

701
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:11,385
This is the Zone.

702
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:15,514
It is made of men's memories
and the ruins of their habits.

703
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:20,811
Does every mirror in the world
lead here?

704
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:23,064
I suppose so.

705
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:26,150
But do not give me
too much credit.

706
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:30,237
Do not think
I know much more than you do.

707
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:37,036
Keep moving.

708
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:42,708
It's hard to follow you.

709
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,545
You move,
but you're motionless.

710
00:59:46,629 --> 00:59:49,048
It's different for me.

711
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:57,014
Glazier!

712
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:16,367
Why are these people prowling
around? Are they alive?

713
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,994
They think so.

714
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:23,332
There's nothing more habit-forming
than habit.

715
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,627
Are we going far?

716
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:30,798
The words you use
have no meaning here.

717
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,926
There's no wind.

718
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,220
Why do you seem to be
heading into the wind?

719
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:39,014
"Why?,,
Always "Why?"

720
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:42,643
Ask no more questions.
Keep moving.

721
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:51,068
Must I take you by the hand?

722
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:27,688
Did you receive orders
to transmit your messages?

723
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,939
Yes.

724
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:32,568
Did you receive orders to transmit
<i>certain</i> messages?

725
01:01:32,735 --> 01:01:34,653
Didn't you have to submit
the texts first?

726
01:01:34,737 --> 01:01:36,780
Be careful how you answer.

727
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,366
No. I invented the phrases
and numbers.

728
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,119
I myself sent some phrases
I had written earlier.

729
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:44,205
Did you notice anything peculiar

730
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:46,457
about Heurtebise's behavior?

731
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,419
I admired how he could
appear and disappear at will.

732
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:52,338
I wished I could do that,

733
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:54,548
but Death told me
I'd never be able to.

734
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:57,218
- That I was too clumsy.
- Enough.

735
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,221
Take the young man away.

736
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:09,104
Bring the next person in.

737
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,044
May I sit down?

738
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,712
Be seated.

739
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:36,757
May I smoke?

740
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,801
If you wish.

741
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:47,101
Having been given orders --

742
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:49,270
or at least permission --

743
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:51,397
to take a young man
into your service...

744
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,024
you are accused
of having taken his wife as well.

745
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,529
Furthermore, of having undertaken
a private enterprise,

746
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,949
and of having used initiative.

747
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,243
What do you have to say
in response?

748
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:06,203
Nothing.

749
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,456
It was a series
of circumstances.

750
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,001
There are no circumstances
allowed here.

751
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,627
There are only orders.

752
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,379
Did you have orders?

753
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:20,009
The laws of the other world
are so different from ours.

754
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,346
Perhaps I overstepped my authority
without realizing it.

755
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:36,525
Before continuing the enquiry,

756
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:38,861
we must wait for another suspect
and a witness.

757
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:40,612
They're here.

758
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:51,832
Hello.

759
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:54,335
We've been cornered.

760
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:58,172
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
These are my judges.

761
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,382
Stay calm.

762
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:02,718
Come forward.

763
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:07,890
So, Heurtebise...

764
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:11,685
now is the time to say
what you have to say.

765
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:14,355
I have nothing to say.

766
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:20,402
You are accused
of taking part in an intrigue

767
01:04:20,486 --> 01:04:23,781
in which Death was involved
without permission.

768
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:26,033
Do you have a valid excuse?

769
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:28,535
I Was her aide.
I followed her.

770
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:31,205
You lingered in the human world
for personal reasons,

771
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:33,332
which you had no right to do.

772
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,751
Perhaps.

773
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,878
There is no "perhaps" here.

774
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:39,588
Answer.

775
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,882
I didn't mean to disobey.

776
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,426
Come forward.

777
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,596
You. You!

778
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,265
- Me?
- Yes, you.

779
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:51,975
Your name.

780
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:56,188
- Your profession?
- Poet.

781
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:58,899
The card says "writer."

782
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:02,986
- It's almost the same thing.
- There is no "almost" here.

783
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,781
What do you mean by "poet"?

784
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:09,159
To write,
without being a writer.

785
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:16,333
Do you know this man?

786
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:18,585
Yes.

787
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:21,338
Do you admit
you took his wife?

788
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:23,674
Yes.

789
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:26,343
To get her out of the way
and have this man for yourself?

790
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:28,637
- Gentlemen --
- Silence.

791
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,849
Calm down.

792
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:36,353
- Keep calm.
- Do you love this man?

793
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,069
Yes.

794
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:47,823
Is it true you entered his room
to watch him sleep?

795
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,951
Yes.

796
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:03,172
Sign this paper.

797
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:09,887
Do you have a pen?

798
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:15,767
I forgot you're not a writer.

799
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:30,240
Show these two people out.

800
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,581
Not you.

801
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:40,125
Stay here.

802
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:52,679
Come forward.

803
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,229
Do you recognize this man?

804
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,024
Of course. It's Heurtebise.

805
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:06,818
Did he attempt to speak to you
in your husband's absence?

806
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:09,738
Did he say anything
shameful to you?

807
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:11,782
Shameful?

808
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:14,243
Of course not.
It's Heurtebise.

809
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:18,580
Heurtebise,
do you love this woman?

810
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:27,464
I repeat:
Do you love this woman?

811
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:31,635
- Yes.
- That is all we wanted to know.

812
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,637
Sign here.

813
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,319
And you told them yes?

814
01:07:49,403 --> 01:07:51,738
One cannot lie here.

815
01:07:51,822 --> 01:07:54,157
My love.

816
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:56,910
I loved you
even before we met.

817
01:07:56,994 --> 01:07:59,079
I must have seemed
very stupid to you.

818
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,623
What can we say
to each other?

819
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:05,377
I don't have the right
to love anyone...

820
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,839
and yet I love.

821
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:22,561
You are all-powerful.

822
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,855
In your eyes.

823
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:29,026
Here Death takes on
innumerable forms.

824
01:08:29,234 --> 01:08:32,446
Young and old,
they receive orders.

825
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:36,116
And if you disobeyed
those orders?

826
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:38,827
They can't kill you.
It is you who kill.

827
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:43,165
- What they do is worse.
- Where do the orders come from?

828
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:48,879
They are sent back and forth
by so many sentinels

829
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,757
like the tom-toms
of your African tribes...

830
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:55,052
the echoes
of your mountains...

831
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:57,929
the wind whispering
through your trees.

832
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:00,641
I will go to he
who gives those orders.

833
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:04,269
My poor love,
he exists nowhere.

834
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,939
Some say he thinks of us...

835
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:10,442
others, that we are his thoughts.

836
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:13,904
Others say he sleeps
and that we are his dream...

837
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,949
his bad dream.

838
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,372
I'll take you away from here
when they set us free.

839
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,082
Set us free?

840
01:09:25,165 --> 01:09:27,793
I never want to leave you.

841
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,962
I must leave you

842
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:34,132
but I swear I will find a way
to bring us back together.

843
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,510
Say "forever."

844
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:40,055
- Forever.
- Swear it.

845
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:43,433
I swear.

846
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:46,103
But now --

847
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:50,774
- Now their police are here.
- A miracle will happen.

848
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:52,693
Miracles only happen
in your world.

849
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:54,444
All worlds are moved by lovers.

850
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:58,198
In our world no one is moved.
One goes from judge to judge.

851
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,828
Come.

852
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:09,167
Go on. I love you.

853
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,128
Do not be afraid.

854
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:13,380
I don't want to lose you again.

855
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:15,298
If you resist,
you will lose <i>us.</i>

856
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:17,759
Follow me.

857
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,487
Gentlemen.

858
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:45,787
I shall now pronounce the verdict.

859
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,623
"We, this tribunal,

860
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:53,503
release Orpheus' Death
and her aides on bail.

861
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:56,423
Orpheus is free

862
01:10:56,506 --> 01:10:59,050
on condition that he never speak
of what he has seen.

863
01:10:59,843 --> 01:11:01,803
Eurydice is free to return to life
in the other world

864
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,181
on condition that Orpheus
never look upon her.

865
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:07,684
A single glance at her
and he will lose her forever."

866
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:09,144
- But --
- Silence!

867
01:11:09,227 --> 01:11:11,104
Here is your wife.

868
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:13,732
Be careful!
Don't look at her!

869
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,236
You've made a good start.

870
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:23,533
May I be permitted to accompany
Orpheus to his house?

871
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:27,287
I'm afraid he may find it difficult
to comply with orders

872
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,581
without supervision
by one of our people.

873
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:31,792
You may accompany the couple.

874
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:35,545
Under our watchful eye,
of course.

875
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:39,925
- Do you have the gloves?
- No.

876
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:42,719
- Oh, yes. In my pocket.
- Put them on.

877
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:50,894
Close your eyes.
I will guide you.

878
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:53,146
It will be easier that way
in the beginning.

879
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:59,528
And... her?

880
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:02,113
May I look at her?

881
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,324
Under no circumstances.

882
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,827
You must not open your eyes
under any circumstances!

883
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:09,955
Take hold of him by the shoulders.
It will be safer that way.

884
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:12,040
Come.

885
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:24,094
Where are the judges?

886
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,722
The swine!

887
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,142
Cegeste...

888
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:35,605
If I were of our former world,

889
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:38,650
I'd say

890
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:41,027
let's have a drink.

891
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,217
How could it be 6:00?

892
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:05,719
We entered the mirror at 6:00.

893
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:08,471
You must not speak of these things.
You gave your word.

894
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,390
There's a letter.

895
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:12,142
I'll go.

896
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:14,227
Call out from the garden,
"I'm coming back in..."

897
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:15,812
And Eurydice will hide.

898
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:18,523
- How convenient.
- What a nightmare!

899
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:38,877
Be careful!

900
01:13:39,336 --> 01:13:41,630
Why shouldn't I look at myself?

901
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:44,674
If Orpheus comes in,
he might see you in the mirror.

902
01:13:44,966 --> 01:13:47,302
It's a good thing you came.

903
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:53,391
You're not angry with me
for what I said at the tribunal?

904
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:55,977
What did you say?

905
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:00,732
Excuse me.

906
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:05,320
When Orpheus comes in,
hide under the table.

907
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:10,116
An anonymous letter,
written backwards.

908
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,702
Look out, Eurydice!
He's coming!

909
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,168
Be careful, Orpheus.

910
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,797
- Eurydice, are you under the table?
- I am.

911
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:26,216
Where is he?

912
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:28,718
- Where are you?
- Over there, under the table.

913
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:30,804
That's great.

914
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:36,142
YOU ARE A THIEF AND A MURDERER
WE WILL MEET ON YOUR GRAVE

915
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:38,395
Beware of mirrors.

916
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:43,149
- No need to tell me.
- I meant her reflection.

917
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,944
Heurtebise forbids me
to look at myself in the mirror.

918
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:48,738
Get rid of that stupid letter!

919
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,615
May I come out?

920
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:53,743
Just a minute.
Turn your back.

921
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:55,328
You can come out.

922
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:57,414
I can't even say
how difficult this is...

923
01:14:57,497 --> 01:15:01,001
the tension
such an absurd thing causes!

924
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:03,044
We will get used to it.

925
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:05,130
Funny thing to get used to!

926
01:15:05,213 --> 01:15:07,132
It's better than being blind...

927
01:15:07,215 --> 01:15:08,842
or losing a leg.

928
01:15:08,925 --> 01:15:11,344
We don't have much choice.

929
01:15:11,636 --> 01:15:13,471
It even has its advantages.

930
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:15,432
Orpheus won't see my wrinkles.

931
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:17,892
Fine!

932
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:20,687
You seem to be taking this well!

933
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,522
I don't see what else
your wife could do.

934
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:24,691
- What else she could --
- Careful!

935
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:26,443
You're dangerous, my friend.

936
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:29,863
I'm not going to live
with blinders on!

937
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:32,282
I'll get you a drink.
Close your eyes.

938
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:35,285
Heurtebise will sit you down
while I'm in the kitchen.

939
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:38,621
I'll tell you what else
my wife could do:

940
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:41,750
She could realize
the awful position I'm in.

941
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,710
You think she doesn't suffer too?

942
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:46,463
You're wrong.
Women adore complications.

943
01:15:46,546 --> 01:15:48,715
Close your eyes.

944
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:53,595
- What if I put on a blindfold?
- That would be cheating.

945
01:15:53,678 --> 01:15:56,556
It's wiser to get used to it
right from the start.

946
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,768
It won't be easy, I know,
but we'll manage.

947
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:02,854
Bring a chair.
Sit down.

948
01:16:02,937 --> 01:16:04,898
I'll turn my back.

949
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:10,111
It's when you're moving around
that you're dangerous.

950
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:15,158
A picture of your wife
is not your wife.

951
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:17,660
I'm so tired.

952
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:20,121
A decision has to be made
about how to handle this situation,

953
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:21,664
and it's up to me to make it.

954
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:24,501
We can't spend our lives
playing hide-and-seek.

955
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:26,586
Do you want me
to go live somewhere else?

956
01:16:26,669 --> 01:16:29,339
- Always exaggerating!
- Come on, Orpheus.

957
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:32,634
We can't share the same room.

958
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:35,553
I'll sleep here on the sofa.

959
01:16:35,887 --> 01:16:37,514
Now who's exaggerating?

960
01:16:38,014 --> 01:16:39,307
Be careful!

961
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:42,519
It's her fault! She could provoke
even a corpse to turn around!

962
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:46,064
- I should have stayed dead.
- Tell her to be quiet!

963
01:16:46,606 --> 01:16:49,943
I'm incredibly on edge.
I could do anything!

964
01:16:51,027 --> 01:16:53,279
You've made your wife cry.

965
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:55,949
Since I annoy everyone,
I'll leave!

966
01:16:56,032 --> 01:16:58,993
- Where are you going?
- To my room.

967
01:17:07,794 --> 01:17:09,546
Try to calm down.

968
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:12,048
He hates me.

969
01:17:12,507 --> 01:17:15,552
If he hated you, he would not have
snared you from Death.

970
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:19,305
For that he will always
be remembered.

971
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:21,683
He didn't come for me.

972
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:25,770
You know that.

973
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:28,481
Just like you know
where he's going

974
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:30,984
when he goes into his car.

975
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:14,402
<i>Orpheus was lost to Eurydice.</i>

976
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:17,530
<i>She could not bear
to live this way.</i>

977
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:19,866
<i>She wanted to save him
from herself..</i>

978
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:22,869
<i>And there was only one way
to do it.</i>

979
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:30,460
Do you love this man?

980
01:18:33,296 --> 01:18:36,090
I'm asking you
if you love this man.

981
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:39,802
What is it?
Is that you?

982
01:18:41,554 --> 01:18:44,474
It's me, Eurydice.

983
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:48,102
I know you often fall asleep
with the lamp on,

984
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:51,606
but since the electricity has been
cut off for an hour,

985
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:54,734
I came down to find a book.

986
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:57,654
A book?
To read in the dark?

987
01:18:57,737 --> 01:18:59,614
Try to understand.

988
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:03,993
Think of the risk you're exposing us to
with your carelessness.

989
01:19:04,202 --> 01:19:07,288
Go upstairs
and close the trapdoor.

990
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:11,292
You've scared the wits out of me.

991
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:15,004
- Do you forgive me?
- Of course.

992
01:19:15,338 --> 01:19:18,299
Go upstairs and sleep.

993
01:19:23,179 --> 01:19:25,974
<i>A short black-out</i>

994
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:28,518
<i>had made her miss her chance.</i>

995
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:31,437
<i>She had to go on living,</i>

996
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:33,898
<i>and the next day --</i>

997
01:19:46,744 --> 01:19:49,706
You've come just in time.
Do you understand the code?

998
01:19:51,624 --> 01:19:53,543
Stock market quotations.

999
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:55,920
- What about this?
- Be careful, your wife is coming.

1000
01:19:56,546 --> 01:19:58,548
Don't push her too far.

1001
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,884
- May I come in?
- Close your eyes for a minute.

1002
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:05,221
Yes, come in.

1003
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,563
Your husband was listening
to the stock market.

1004
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:16,607
- Get in the back.
- Am I bothering you?

1005
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:20,361
I was listening out here
so I wouldn't disturb you in the house.

1006
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:24,407
- That noise frightens me.
- Don't take risks.

1007
01:20:24,532 --> 01:20:26,576
What risks?

1008
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:29,495
Orpheus can't see me,
but I can touch his cheek.

1009
01:20:31,914 --> 01:20:33,666
It's wonderful!

1010
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:36,586
The mirror!

1011
01:20:38,588 --> 01:20:40,673
That was bound to happen.

1012
01:20:47,263 --> 01:20:49,265
It had to happen.

1013
01:20:52,643 --> 01:20:54,729
It had to happen, Heurtebise.

1014
01:20:54,812 --> 01:20:57,648
I had enough of half-measures
and arrangements.

1015
01:20:57,732 --> 01:21:00,610
There's no getting used to that.
You have to go all the way.

1016
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:04,655
Stones. You can make
a statue of me with them!

1017
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:06,240
You must not stay outside.

1018
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:10,620
There they are, the swine!
I've been expecting them.

1019
01:21:10,703 --> 01:21:12,747
The letter, Heurtebise.
The anonymous letter.

1020
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:13,831
I'll talk to them.

1021
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:16,751
What does marble think
when it's being sculpted?

1022
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:19,962
It thinks, "I am struck,
insulted, ruined, lost."

1023
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,508
Life is sculpting me.
Let it finish its work.

1024
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:39,023
- Cowards!
- Threaten them with this.

1025
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:40,650
This is your house!

1026
01:22:06,759 --> 01:22:10,346
Give me that revolver.
I'm ordering you to give it to me.

1027
01:22:12,765 --> 01:22:14,142
And I order you to get out.

1028
01:22:14,225 --> 01:22:15,935
I forbid you to set foot
on my property.

1029
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:19,439
- I'll come onto your property as I like.
- Do you want to kill me?

1030
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:21,732
We want to know
where Jacques Cegeste is.

1031
01:22:22,316 --> 01:22:25,194
- Is he here with you?
- Stay back or I'll shoot.

1032
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:27,280
I'll shoot!

1033
01:23:11,073 --> 01:23:13,075
- Step away from the door.
- Keep calm.

1034
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:15,453
He's only wounded.
No one will harm you.

1035
01:23:45,942 --> 01:23:46,943
Is it done?

1036
01:23:48,444 --> 01:23:49,946
It is done.

1037
01:24:58,848 --> 01:25:01,017
- Cegeste.
- Madam?

1038
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:05,396
This is the first time I have almost
understood the notion of time.

1039
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:08,941
Waiting must be frightful for men.

1040
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,319
I no longer remember.

1041
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:16,282
- Are you bored?
- What's that?

1042
01:25:17,241 --> 01:25:19,035
Forgive me.

1043
01:25:19,535 --> 01:25:21,621
I was talking to myself.

1044
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:40,139
<i>This is no longer the same journey.</i>

1045
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:42,725
<i>Heurtebise leads Orpheus</i>

1046
01:25:42,808 --> 01:25:45,519
<i>where he should not lead him.</i>

1047
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,106
<i>No longer the wonderful
motionless journey,</i>

1048
01:25:49,523 --> 01:25:52,985
<i>Orpheus and his guide trudge on,</i>

1049
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:56,405
<i>forced backward
then forward</i>

1050
01:25:56,572 --> 01:25:59,950
<i>by a great unexplained wind.</i>

1051
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,902
They are here.

1052
01:26:43,536 --> 01:26:45,705
I found a way to come
to you again.

1053
01:26:45,788 --> 01:26:47,957
I cried softly for so long
that you finally came.

1054
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,293
I heard you
and waited for you.

1055
01:26:52,002 --> 01:26:54,255
I did not want you to stay
among men.

1056
01:26:55,965 --> 01:26:59,593
- Where shall we hide?
- We no longer have to hide.

1057
01:27:01,262 --> 01:27:04,181
- We will be free.
- Forever?

1058
01:27:06,892 --> 01:27:08,310
Forever.

1059
01:27:08,644 --> 01:27:11,063
Hold me, Orpheus.
Hold me tight.

1060
01:27:12,857 --> 01:27:16,277
You burn like ice.

1061
01:27:16,777 --> 01:27:19,405
You still have
a human warmth.

1062
01:27:19,572 --> 01:27:22,199
- It's nice.
- I love you.

1063
01:27:22,992 --> 01:27:25,494
I love you.

1064
01:27:26,287 --> 01:27:28,414
- Will you obey me?
- I will obey you.

1065
01:27:28,497 --> 01:27:30,249
- Whatever I ask?
- Whatever you ask.

1066
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:33,377
Even if I condemned you?
If I tortured you?

1067
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:35,254
I belong to you

1068
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:36,797
and I will never leave you.

1069
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:38,799
Never again.

1070
01:27:42,094 --> 01:27:44,805
- You know what I expect of you.
- But madam --

1071
01:27:44,889 --> 01:27:47,933
It's our last hope,
and we haven't a second to lose.

1072
01:27:48,017 --> 01:27:50,770
- Reconsider --
- There is no need to reconsider.

1073
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:54,273
There is nothing worse
in <i>any</i> world.

1074
01:27:54,356 --> 01:27:55,775
Are you a coward?

1075
01:27:55,858 --> 01:27:58,027
<i>The Death of a poet</i>

1076
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:59,904
<i>must sacrifice itself</i>

1077
01:27:59,987 --> 01:28:02,364
<i>to make him immortal.</i>

1078
01:28:03,532 --> 01:28:05,743
For the last time,
I beg you...

1079
01:28:05,826 --> 01:28:08,370
do not try to understand
what I am going to do,

1080
01:28:09,288 --> 01:28:13,918
for in truth it would be difficult
to understand even in our world.

1081
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,756
- Stand here.
- Quick.

1082
01:28:18,839 --> 01:28:20,591
Cegeste, to work!

1083
01:28:21,467 --> 01:28:24,428
Orpheus, don't move.
Stay still. You promised.

1084
01:28:25,179 --> 01:28:26,722
Work, work!

1085
01:28:27,306 --> 01:28:30,351
Heurtebise, I'll help you.
I'll Work along with you.

1086
01:28:30,726 --> 01:28:32,228
Don't weaken.

1087
01:28:32,311 --> 01:28:36,232
Count... calculate.
Labor as I labor.

1088
01:28:36,315 --> 01:28:39,401
Seal him up. You must!

1089
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:41,821
Without willpower
we are cripples.

1090
01:28:43,864 --> 01:28:45,616
I can do no more.

1091
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:49,245
You must will it, Heurtebise.
You must!

1092
01:28:50,246 --> 01:28:52,581
- I can't.
- You're not trying.

1093
01:28:52,665 --> 01:28:56,252
Don't speak.
Go deep inside yourself

1094
01:28:56,335 --> 01:29:00,297
and escape from yourself.
Run! Overturn all obstacles!

1095
01:29:00,631 --> 01:29:02,842
You're nearly there.

1096
01:29:03,634 --> 01:29:05,803
You're there.

1097
01:29:06,512 --> 01:29:08,556
I see it.

1098
01:29:09,807 --> 01:29:11,308
I'm almost there.

1099
01:29:11,767 --> 01:29:14,436
A final effort, Heurtebise.

1100
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,231
Do it.

1101
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,277
Are you there?

1102
01:29:21,944 --> 01:29:23,946
Answer me.
Are you there?

1103
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:27,116
I'm there.

1104
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:31,120
Then set out.

1105
01:29:31,954 --> 01:29:33,873
Go back in time.

1106
01:29:33,956 --> 01:29:36,750
What has been
must no longer be.

1107
01:30:01,901 --> 01:30:04,236
Glazier!

1108
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:30,679
- I'm very tired.
- I don't care!

1109
01:30:31,138 --> 01:30:34,350
Work.
Work, I command you!

1110
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:39,039
Where are you?

1111
01:31:39,748 --> 01:31:41,667
In the room.

1112
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:43,544
The gloves.

1113
01:31:43,627 --> 01:31:45,129
Get the gloves, quick!

1114
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:13,782
Were you watching me sleep?

1115
01:32:15,451 --> 01:32:17,411
Yes, my love.

1116
01:32:18,412 --> 01:32:21,790
- I had a terrible nightmare.
- You don't feel ill?

1117
01:32:22,124 --> 01:32:25,753
- No. A little headache.
- I will cure you.

1118
01:32:27,087 --> 01:32:29,673
- Were you working?
- I was working.

1119
01:32:29,757 --> 01:32:32,551
You work too hard.
Try to rest.

1120
01:32:32,634 --> 01:32:34,720
My books don't write
themselves.

1121
01:32:34,803 --> 01:32:37,973
- But they do!
- I help them.

1122
01:32:38,057 --> 01:32:39,516
How is the young boy behaving?

1123
01:32:41,018 --> 01:32:43,353
- It might be a girl.
- It's a boy!

1124
01:32:43,437 --> 01:32:45,814
He's kicking me.

1125
01:32:47,066 --> 01:32:51,612
- He'll be as unbearable as his father.
- Unbearable? You?

1126
01:32:52,071 --> 01:32:54,656
Many people find me
unbearable.

1127
01:32:54,865 --> 01:32:56,950
Poor you! They love you.

1128
01:32:57,159 --> 01:33:00,454
- And they loathe me.
- That's a form of love.

1129
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:04,291
There's only one love
that counts:

1130
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:07,044
ours.

1131
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,102
Is it done?

1132
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,187
It is done.

1133
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:29,942
Madam, your own aides.

1134
01:33:30,025 --> 01:33:31,652
They're here to arrest you?

1135
01:33:31,735 --> 01:33:33,028
Yes, Cegeste.

1136
01:33:33,195 --> 01:33:34,988
Flee!

1137
01:33:35,114 --> 01:33:36,824
Where?

1138
01:33:38,075 --> 01:33:39,576
When they arrest you here...

1139
01:33:39,785 --> 01:33:41,078
what happens?

1140
01:33:41,995 --> 01:33:44,206
It's not pleasant.

1141
01:33:44,373 --> 01:33:46,291
It's never pleasant.

1142
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:51,380
Here less than anywhere else.

1143
01:34:04,393 --> 01:34:06,019
Thank you.

1144
01:34:06,562 --> 01:34:08,397
It was nothing.

1145
01:34:09,523 --> 01:34:12,901
We had to return them
to their mire.

1146
01:34:18,198 --> 01:34:20,409
Farewell, Cegeste.

1147
01:35:07,289 --> 01:35:11,877
THE END

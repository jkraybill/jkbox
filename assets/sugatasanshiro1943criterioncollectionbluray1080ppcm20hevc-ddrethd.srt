This film has been modified
from the original version

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:25,242
of Akira Kurosawa's debut film,
which opened in 1943,

4
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:30,880
without consulting the director
or the production staff.

5
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,487
1,845 feet of footage was cut in 1944,

6
00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:37,623
to comply with the government's
wartime entertainment policies.

7
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,259
As much as we'd like to show
the original version,

8
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,532
we were not able to locate
the cut footage.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,169
Yet we strongly believe this modified
version is worthy of rerelease.

10
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,051

the circumstances

<i>This narrow road

<i>This narrow road

00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:58,538
<i>Allow me to pass for a moment</i>

31
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,805
<i>No one must pass

32

<i>I have some business.
Let me pass.</i>

<i>Having made a vow to the Tenjin God</i>

34
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:13,493
Actually, I'm looking for
a jujitsu instructor.

35
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:17,100
<i>You have reason to be afraid
on your way back</i>

36
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,968
A Shimmei-style instructor
lives right there.

37
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,508
But he's out now.

38
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:28,548
He's in an exhibition match
in Asakusa.

SABURO MOMMA - SHIMMEI-STYLE
JUJITSU INSTRUCTOR

40
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,642
We have a new pupil.

41
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:56,557
You're lucky.

42
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,525
You'll see quite a show tonight.

43
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:08,002
We're going to teach
Yano a lesson.

44
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:10,111
Yano?

45
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,011
Don't you know him?

46
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:14,415
The judo wrestler
of the Shudokan.

47
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,051
What's judo?

48
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:22,864
That's a good one.

49
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,502
Yano calls jujitsu "judo."

50
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,870
He wants to make money off it.
What a fraud.

51
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:35,846
The police are looking for
a martial arts instructor.

52
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,477
We're about to make a name
for ourselves in the field.

53
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:42,526
We can't allow him to steal the job
with some fancy name for jujitsu.

54
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,664
He must be stopped.

55
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:00,050
Ambush?

56
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:04,021
Just a match without a referee.

57
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,868
- Sir.
- What is it?

58
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,405
- He's left the shop.
- Where did he go?

59
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:17,001
He's headed this way in a rickshaw.

60
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,012
Let's wait under the bridge.

61
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:20,139
Let's go!

62
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:23,245
No weapons!
Let's not disgrace ourselves!

63
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,487
Come with us.
You may learn a thing or two.

64
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,235
Father, where are you going?

65
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,674
We won't be long.

66
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,445
Is something wrong, Father?

67
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,645
Don't be silly.

68
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,958
Well...

69
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,895
I'm Yano of the Shudokan.

70
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,117
Do you know
who you're attacking?

71
00:06:57,926 --> 00:06:59,087
State your names.

72
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,817
Be prepared for
the Shimmei's final blow.

73
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,911
Your name?

74
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:15,074
Kill me!

75
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,153
I won't kill you
or even break your arm.

76
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:19,086
Just tell me your name.

77
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,862
What have I done to you?

78
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,965
Nothing.
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

79
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,672
Teach me a lesson?

80
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,710
How foolish.

81
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:36,441
Jujitsu is on the decline
because of men like you.

82
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:45,054
I won't live in shame after I'm beat
by a scoundrel like you.

83
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,062
Kill me now!

84
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:52,371
You should have shown
that spirit in your jujitsu.

85
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:56,005
What a waste.

86
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,802
Rickshawman!

87
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,349
Rickshawman!

88
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:28,255
It's over.

89
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,864
Sir, let me take you.

90
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:41,534
Get in.

91
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,473
Can you drive?

92
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:46,712
Good.

93
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:52,723
Thank you.

94
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,243
It's a fight!

95
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,720
Come on!

96
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,586
I did nothing to you.

97
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:26,760
You said something.
Say it again!

98
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,596
You scoundrel!

99
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:35,375
Don't be haughty.

100
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,572
What?

101
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:26,806
Sir.

102
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,791
Sugata is back.

103
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,624
Send him in.

104
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,063
Sir.

105
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:46,931
Be easy on him.

106
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:54,078
Bring him in.

107
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,716
Well?

108
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:30,212
You must have enjoyed fighting.

109
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,178
I'm sorry.

110
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,854
I should've been there
to watch you fight.

111
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,421
You're strong... very strong.

112
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:05,469
Maybe even stronger than me.

113
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:10,878
But...

114
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:16,254
your judo and my judo...

115
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,619
are worlds apart.

116
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,202
Do you know why?

117
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:29,545
Because you don't
understand humanity.

118
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,679
Teaching judo to such a man...

119
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:39,120
is like giving a knife to a lunatic.

120
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:43,028
Sir, I understand humanity.

121
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,464
You don't!

122
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,941
You live without reason or purpose.

123
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:56,111
Where is your humanity?

124
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,656
Humanity is nature's rule...

125
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,761
by which we live and die.

126
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:11,233
Only according to this principle
can you die in peace.

127
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:19,209
It is the true essence of all life...

128
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:23,914
and of judo as well.

129
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,055
Sugata...

130
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:31,365
you haven't realized this.

131
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,738
But, sir, I am willing to die
if you tell me to.

132
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:38,906
- Liar!
- No. I am!

133
00:19:39,015 --> 00:19:40,744
Shut up!

134
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,842
You're a reckless bully.

135
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:45,981
Your words mean nothing to me.

136
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:54,435
I'm willing to die.

137
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:20,634
Die!

138
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,085
Sir.

139
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,317
Yes?

140
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,895
Sugata is still in the water.

141
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:24,260
It's late. He might die.
Forgive him.

142
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:32,709
He's wild and stubborn,
but this is too much.

143
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:45,025
He can come out whenever he likes.

144
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,432
Not without your forgiveness.

145
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,265
He'll come out when he wants to.

146
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:05,592
Won't you forgive him?

147
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:07,165
Idiot!

148
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:12,936
He won't die. He's thinking.

149
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:21,752
Well, proud one.

150
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:25,284
Are you comfortable?

151
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:31,833
No answer?
You haven't figured it out.

152
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,301
Won't you give up?

153
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:38,811
No!

154
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:43,945
You sound like you can
go on a little longer.

155
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,750
But, Sanshiro...

156
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:50,761
do you know what...

157
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,666
you're hanging on to?

158
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:58,673
Too full of yourself to notice?

159
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,011
It's a stake!

160
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:04,948
Yes, one that keeps you alive.

161
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:10,048
Without it, you'd sink into the mud.

162
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:14,093
You're too proud to come out.

163
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,134
Death is near.

164
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,896
Shut up, monk!

165
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:24,709
Well, then, why don't you
give up and come out?

166
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:27,243
No!

167
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,218
How stubborn.

168
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,723
Suit yourself.

169
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:41,201
The moon is beautiful tonight.
Enjoy the view.

170
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,544
Sir!

171
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,084
Is Mr. Yano here?

172
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,517
He's out.

173
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:01,522
Are his pupils here?

174
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:04,202
I'm one.

175
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:15,479
Are there any others?

176
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:17,715
Just one.

177
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:30,299
I want a match.

178
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:32,241
May I ask your name?

179
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:39,854
I practice the Ryoi style.
I'm Genzaburo Higaki.

180
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,061
Come in.

181
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:30,128
Priest, water.

182
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:41,109
Who's next?

183
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,725
Mr. Higaki.

184
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:59,172
I'm next.

185
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:07,241
No. I'll have a match
with Mr. Yano's pupil.

186
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,853
Then you must leave.

187
00:29:15,864 --> 00:29:17,264
What about him?

188
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:31,512
I'm ready.

189
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,817
No. You can't.

190
00:29:36,995 --> 00:29:38,361
Mr. Higaki.

191
00:29:38,464 --> 00:29:42,061
This pupil is being punished.
He's not allowed to fight matches.

192
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,728
Please leave.

193
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:51,048
That's too bad.

194
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:53,244
Mr. Iinuma.

195
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:56,984
I'm sure Mr. Yano
will allow me in this case.

196
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,588
Perhaps, if he were here.

197
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,600
- But -
- No!

198
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,105
- I'm ready!
- No!

199
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,694
What's your name?

200
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,696
Sanshiro Sugata.

201
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:43,049
I'm sure we'll meet again.

202
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,061
We can meet tomorrow
if Mr. Yano allows it.

203
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:53,504
Don't rush it.

204
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:59,047
Someday jujitsu will fight judo.

205
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,051
What are we waiting for?

206
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,449
- Don't forget.
- I won't.

207
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,047
I don't like him.
He's like a snake.

208
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:27,657
The story now turns to Sayo,
a daughter of Hansuke Murai.

209
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,164
Higaki has learned
jujitsu from Murai.

210
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:37,170
Sayo fears Higaki's dark side,
his snakelike shadow.

211
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:41,206
<i>Listen.</i>

212
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,719
<i>Higaki isn't the only enemy
of the Shudokan.</i>

213
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,692
Today I saw...

214
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:55,925
Police Inspector Shimada.

215
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,134
He wants us to take part

216
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,141
in their martial arts matches

217
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:05,746
as Shudokan judo wrestlers.

218
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:09,546
Mixed-style matches.

219
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:16,725
I said we would be glad to.

220
00:32:19,268 --> 00:32:22,967
I believe he wants the winners

221
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,644
to become martial arts instructors

222
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:30,376
for the police officers.

223
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:34,520
If we win, what will happen?

224
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:40,564
As judo wrestlers,
we will have enemies everywhere.

225
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:45,836
As a matter of fact,
I received this today.

226
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:50,372
It's an invitation
to the opening ceremony...

227
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:56,313
of a Tenjin Shinyo-style dojo
in Yotsuya.

228
00:32:57,424 --> 00:32:58,983
It says:

229
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,664
"To celebrate the opening...

230
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:09,969
we would like to have
an exhibition match...

231
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:12,979
between one of your pupils
and a jujitsu instructor.

232
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:15,550
Please accept our invitation."

233
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:24,663
Can you guess
which one of you was invited?

234
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:29,903
The invitation isn't for me.

235
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:33,877
Sugata...

236
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,574
it's from someone you know.

237
00:33:43,158 --> 00:33:44,649
I get it.

238
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:48,254
Of course they wouldn't invite you, sir.

239
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:50,163
They practice the Shimmei style.

240
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:54,267
Mr. Yano threw them in the river before.

241
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:03,312
Sugata, it'll be your match.

242
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:09,823
Sugata, you may start
practicing tomorrow.

243
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,436
You must know, Sugata,

244
00:34:14,538 --> 00:34:18,203
that Momma has improved
since the last time you saw him.

245
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:23,276
JUJITSU WRESTLERS

246
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,938
JUDO WRESTLERS

247
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:56,256
Show us what you've got.

248
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:01,737
I'm ready.

249
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:14,791
- Come on!
- Shall we begin?

250
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,186
Come on!

251
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,685
Come on!

252
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:04,694
Come on!

253
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:25,775
<i>There goes Sanshiro</i>

254
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:31,188
<i>Do not bother Sanshiro</i>

255
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:36,425
<i>Don't get close to him
Stay away from him</i>

256
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:41,671
<i>Don't touch Sanshiro
He'll get mad</i>

257
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:46,849
<i>There goes Sanshiro</i>

258
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:51,919
<i>Do not bother Sanshiro</i>

259
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:56,993
<i>Don't get close to him
Stay away from him</i>

260
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:01,999
<i>Don't touch Sanshiro
He'll get mad</i>

261
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,736
"Don't touch Sanshiro."

262
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:14,915
Mr. Murai will fight...

263
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,221
Sanshiro Sugata.

264
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:25,872
I know.

265
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:32,777
It won't be easy.

266
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:39,455
It's a fight to the death.

267
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:47,696
He killed Momma in a match.

268
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:52,107
Children sing about him in fear.

269
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:54,214
Father will win.

270
00:38:56,854 --> 00:38:59,756
I'm not so sure about that.

271
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:04,226
He quit drinking
and started training.

272
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,197
Even so, he's old.

273
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:10,739
He's in good shape for his age.

274
00:39:14,946 --> 00:39:15,914
And?

275
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:19,544
And... and -

276
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:23,024
I pray for him.

277
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:30,797
Miss Sayo, there's only one man
who can beat Sugata.

278
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,372
It's me.

279
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:35,343
My father can.

280
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:36,911
No, he can't.

281
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,477
Only I can beat him...

282
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,212
for your father.

283
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,618
Miss Sayo.

284
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:50,922
My father will win!

285
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:09,825
Welcome home.

286
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,437
You know what, Higaki?

287
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:44,500
My life before I quit drinking
seems like a bad dream.

288
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,841
I'm ready to fight.

289
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:49,943
I couldn't ask for a better opponent.
He's strong, very strong.

290
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:57,128
He'll be thinking of me,
Hansuke Murai, as he trains,

291
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:01,333
as he hones his skills.

292
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,935
Sanshiro Sugata.

293
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:38,684
HOUSE FOR RENT

294
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:15,309
Young lady.

295
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:20,048
Who do you want to see?

296
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:24,381
I'll call him for you.

297
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:28,560
Sanshiro Sugata.

298
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:29,792
Sugata?

299
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:40,314
This is Momma's daughter.

300
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,617
I thought something was strange.

301
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:49,194
Sanshiro is still young.

302
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:53,064
Nonetheless, he is badly shaken
by her failed attempt.

303
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:56,628
That night, Yano trains him
by moonlight.

304
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,541
Sanshiro is like a lifeless puppet.

305
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:04,447
But as he is thrown
by the instructor...

306
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:08,080
he regains his courage
and understands.

307
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,989
Yano has taught him what life is.

308
00:43:11,094 --> 00:43:13,724
Sanshiro is of sound mind once again.

309
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,153
Look.

310
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,958
How beautiful.

311
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:51,515
Do you know where
such beauty comes from?

312
00:43:56,862 --> 00:44:00,698
She's completely selfless
in her prayers.

313
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:09,003
She has let go of self
and united with the god of the shrine.

314
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:17,021
Nothing is more powerful than that.

315
00:44:21,065 --> 00:44:23,466
Let's not disturb her.

316
00:44:30,178 --> 00:44:31,976
We've seen a very rare thing.

317
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,509
It's good to behold.

318
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,512
I'll fix it.

319
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,446
No, don't trouble yourself.

320
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,950
You can't walk without it.

321
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,318
I'll fix it myself.

322
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:28,897
I can do it quickly.

323
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:43,877
Here. Put your foot on this.

324
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:55,700
Thank you.

325
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,398
It might be a little too tight.

326
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,429
Thank you.

327
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,116
Your umbrella.

328
00:47:00,799 --> 00:47:02,597
Your handkerchief.

329
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:12,976
You forgot your handkerchief
the other day.

330
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,219
- Don't worry about it.
- I'll bring it to your home.

331
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:21,220
- No need.
- Where do you live?

332
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,128
It's really all right.

333
00:47:30,944 --> 00:47:33,539
I didn't expect you to be here.

334
00:47:33,648 --> 00:47:35,116
Don't worry.

335
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,992
Thank you for washing it.

336
00:47:49,104 --> 00:47:51,096
You really helped me.

337
00:48:04,827 --> 00:48:07,956
What do you pray for every day?

338
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:10,661
For my father to win a match.

339
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:18,572
What sport does he play?

340
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:20,249
Jujitsu.

341
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:26,855
May I ask his name?

342
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,053
Hansuke Murai.

343
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:33,602
He will fight a match with
a judo wrestler from the Shudokan.

344
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:47,147
Do you know who he's to fight?

345
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,450
Yes.

346
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,756
Sanshiro Sugata.

347
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:55,164
Father told me he's young
and very strong.

348
00:48:58,072 --> 00:49:01,976
I'm sorry, I must be going.
Excuse me.

349
00:49:29,118 --> 00:49:33,489
It's me. I'm Sanshiro Sugata.

350
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:48,972
I wish your father good luck.

351
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:11,702
POLICE MARTIAL ARTS
TOURNAMENT

352
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:22,062
METROPOLITAN
POLICE DEPARTMENT

353
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:30,437
What's keeping Sugata?

354
00:50:31,643 --> 00:50:34,079
When we left he said, "Too early."

355
00:50:34,181 --> 00:50:35,979
He was reading.

356
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:38,646
I'm worried.

357
00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:42,886
"The spirits of heaven and earth
congregate in our nation of gods.

358
00:50:43,427 --> 00:50:47,058
For us they have built Mt. Fuji
that towers for eternity.

359
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,732
For us they have brought water
to flow around our islands.

360
00:50:52,307 --> 00:50:55,039
For us they have created
the beauty of cherry blossoms -"

361
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:32,898
Idiot!
This is an important match.

362
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:34,902
What the hell are you thinking?

363
00:51:42,815 --> 00:51:44,716
I can't do it.

364
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,228
I can't win.

365
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:56,392
What?

366
00:51:57,103 --> 00:51:59,299
Are you afraid of Hansuke Murai?

367
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:00,874
No.

368
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:04,343
Someone stands
between him and me.

369
00:52:08,586 --> 00:52:09,554
Who?

370
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:11,624
His daughter.

371
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:15,628
- You love her?
- No.

372
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:23,133
It's not that.

373
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:30,674
Priest, I saw her praying
selflessly for her father.

374
00:52:30,786 --> 00:52:32,652
It was beautiful and I was touched.

375
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:35,753
That's the problem.

376
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,992
How can I overcome it?

377
00:52:43,104 --> 00:52:44,230
Stupid!

378
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:55,352
Be pure and innocent like her.

379
00:52:56,557 --> 00:52:59,858
- I can't.
- You can. You once were.

380
00:53:00,963 --> 00:53:02,591
When?

381
00:53:11,913 --> 00:53:15,008
Sanshiro Sugata found new life there.

382
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:20,314
Have you forgotten?

383
00:53:23,163 --> 00:53:25,689
What is your life, Sanshiro?

384
00:53:44,094 --> 00:53:45,561
You're late!

385
00:53:45,663 --> 00:53:46,823
Hurry!

386
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:12,396
You're a lucky man.

387
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:14,027
Why?

388
00:54:14,138 --> 00:54:17,074
Murai won't let me fight you.

389
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,278
We'll fight, sooner or later.

390
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:25,285
- Really?
- I promise.

391
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:30,660
Come. Let's go.

392
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:48,445
MATCH BETWEEN
A TIGER AND A DRAGON

393
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:06,141
Stay calm. Be like Mr. Yano.

394
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:26,742
<i>Demonstration match.</i>

395
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:31,917
Mr. Hansuke Murai
of the Shinto style.

396
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:03,688
Sanshiro Sugata
of the Shudokan.

397
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,600
Call him "mister" too!

398
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:10,470
Yeah, that's not fair!

399
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,044
Play fair!

400
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:16,304
Thirty minutes. No judging.

401
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:18,204
Let's begin.

402
00:57:54,563 --> 00:57:55,621
Shall we?

403
01:00:37,136 --> 01:00:38,764
<i>Father will win.</i>

404
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:49,780
<i>Father will win.</i>

405
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:03,069
<i>Father will surely win.</i>

406
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,780
I give up.

407
01:02:19,052 --> 01:02:20,850
We have a winner.

408
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,913
Mr. Murai!

409
01:02:50,098 --> 01:02:51,566
Thank you.

410
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,903
Thank you.

411
01:02:58,944 --> 01:03:00,412
Mr. Sugata.

412
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:04,083
You're strong.

413
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:07,685
You're great.

414
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:10,520
I'm no match for you.

415
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:14,258
I was lucky.

416
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:25,742
Take care.

417
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:14,919
<i>There goes Sanshiro</i>

418
01:04:15,623 --> 01:04:20,222
<i>Do not bother Sanshiro</i>

419
01:04:20,998 --> 01:04:25,460
<i>Don't get close to him
Stay away from him</i>

420
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,645
<i>Don't touch Sanshiro
He'll get mad</i>

421
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,728
Mr. Sugata.

422
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:09,462
To tell you the truth...

423
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:13,274
I used all my strength
in the match with you

424
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,005
for the first time in my life.

425
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:19,544
I did my best.

426
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,724
When the match was over,

427
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:27,590
my body felt broken.

428
01:05:30,668 --> 01:05:33,001
It wasn't a good feeling.

429
01:05:35,107 --> 01:05:38,237
I'm glad you came.

430
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:43,208
Let me thank you again.

431
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:49,751
I sent Sayo for you.
Were you embarrassed?

432
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:54,325
No. Not at all.

433
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,760
It was a good match.

434
01:06:19,573 --> 01:06:21,201
I even felt good
when you threw me.

435
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:25,840
No hard feelings.

436
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:38,199
Supper is ready.

437
01:06:39,202 --> 01:06:43,368
Father, will you have
the soup in bed?

438
01:06:43,475 --> 01:06:46,502
No. I'll get up. I feel good.

439
01:07:12,852 --> 01:07:14,319
Delicious!

440
01:07:15,189 --> 01:07:17,886
Sayo is a good cook.

441
01:08:33,604 --> 01:08:37,667
"As promised,
we shall fight a duel as follows:

442
01:08:38,377 --> 01:08:41,815
On the night of December 26,
at 8:00 on Ukyo Field.

443
01:08:42,517 --> 01:08:45,146
The witness will be
Mr. Iinuma of the Kito style.

444
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:49,456
It shall be fought
using jujitsu skills.

445
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:54,661
Please remember that
this is a fight to the death.

446
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:57,066
From Gennosuke Higaki

447
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:59,471
to Sanshiro Sugata."

448
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:14,730
<i>A bloody sword in the right hand
Reins in the left hand</i>

449
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:20,799
<i>Of a little boy</i>

450
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:25,403
<i>Riding on a horse</i>

451
01:09:26,448 --> 01:09:33,755
<i>Don't shed tears for me</i>

452
01:09:35,428 --> 01:09:39,958
<i>What we face tonight</i>

453
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:45,402
<i>Is bigger than our love</i>

454
01:09:46,845 --> 01:09:54,448
<i>The horses are wet
with the pouring rain</i>

455
01:09:56,793 --> 01:10:01,425
<i>I can't go past</i>

456
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:05,596
<i>The slope of Tabaru</i>

457
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,367
Wait.

458
01:10:52,475 --> 01:10:55,468
My last question.
Do you have to fight?

459
01:10:56,213 --> 01:10:57,476
Yes!

460
01:10:58,418 --> 01:11:01,582
I thought it would
come to this some day.

461
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:04,318
But a fight to the death
isn't good.

462
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,054
I can't let either of you die.

463
01:11:07,898 --> 01:11:12,166
If only you had let us
fight last year.

464
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:14,573
It's too late now.

465
01:11:16,811 --> 01:11:19,280
I hate to lose either of you.

466
01:11:19,982 --> 01:11:22,076
Mr. Iinuma.

467
01:11:22,953 --> 01:11:25,924
Laugh at us.
We're young and stupid.

468
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:32,400
It's our fate.

469
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:39,275
In that case...

470
01:11:44,886 --> 01:11:45,978
begin.

471
01:13:19,424 --> 01:13:20,687
It can't be!

472
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:44,690
Give up.

473
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:48,218
Enough!

474
01:14:51,594 --> 01:14:53,222
Not yet!

475
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:57,099
Not yet!

476
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,408
By the way...

477
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:51,744
I don't see Sugata today.

478
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:55,948
He suddenly decided
to go on a trip.

479
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:59,117
A trip? Why?

480
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:07,501
I think he has
something to think over.

481
01:16:10,811 --> 01:16:13,975
That kid thinks too much.

482
01:16:14,082 --> 01:16:17,542
He's worried about Higaki.

483
01:16:23,263 --> 01:16:27,531
Higaki's also changed
since their match.

484
01:16:27,636 --> 01:16:30,197
He doesn't hate Sugata.

485
01:16:30,306 --> 01:16:33,539
Then what's Sanshiro's problem?

486
01:16:46,797 --> 01:16:48,561
Mr. Yano...

487
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:51,102
tell him this:

488
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:55,266
"If you feel you're in a tight spot,

489
01:16:56,244 --> 01:17:00,740
come back to look at
the stake in the pond."

490
01:17:03,589 --> 01:17:05,888
That won't be necessary.

491
01:17:07,494 --> 01:17:12,297
Mr. Yano,
he's finally become a man.

492
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:13,869
No, not in the least.

493
01:17:15,072 --> 01:17:18,373
He's always like a baby.

494
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:31,792
Does it bother you that
I'll be seeing you off at Yokohama?

495
01:17:32,598 --> 01:17:33,826
No.

496
01:17:36,738 --> 01:17:41,234
Father insisted on my seeing you off.

497
01:17:41,845 --> 01:17:43,313
It's quite all right.

498
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,123
What's wrong?

499
01:17:51,225 --> 01:17:53,126
Dust in my eye.

500
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:05,678
Does it hurt?

501
01:18:13,158 --> 01:18:14,956
I'll be back soon.

502
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:19,326
Take care of your father.

503
01:18:45,205 --> 01:18:52,341
THE END

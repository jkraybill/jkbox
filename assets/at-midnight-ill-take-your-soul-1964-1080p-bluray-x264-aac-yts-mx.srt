1
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,880
What is life?

2
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:31,895
It is the beginning of death.

3
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,898
What is death?

4
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,937
It is the end of life.

5
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,942
What is existence?

6
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:47,915
It is the continuity of blood.

7
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:51,921
What is blood?

8
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:56,918
It is the reason to exist!

9
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,980
AT MIDNIGHT I'LL TAKE YOUR SOUL

10
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:46,981
I wish you a terrible evening,

11
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,000
my brave little friends.

12
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:59,008
Remember these words:

13
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:06,008
Those of you who have
been watching a funeral,

14
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:13,985
and seen the pale face of a corpse.

15
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:24,066
Those of you who don't
believe in wandering ghosts

16
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:32,020
when you leave this theatre...

17
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:39,029
and have to walk in the dark streets...

18
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:41,999
alone...

19
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,269
There is still time.

20
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:49,009
Don't watch this movie!

21
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:52,013
Go home!

22
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:00,525
Too late.

23
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,030
You've not believed.

24
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:10,037
You want to show a
courage that doesn't exist?

25
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,041
Then, stay!

26
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,010
Suffer!

27
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,015
Watch...

28
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:28,019
"At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul!"

29
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:56,034
Oh, Carlos, why did you
leave me? Why?

30
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:58,303
Be brave, Mrs. Joana.

31
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,066
My condolences, Mrs. Joana.

32
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:25,039
You can be sure that I
provided the best of my services.

33
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,310
Excuse me...

34
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
Bring my lunch, Lenita.

35
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,051
Coming, Zé.

36
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,068
That funeral made me hungry...

37
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:14,063
I'm thinking of doubling
my fee to follow the burial.

38
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,072
I'm sick and tired of all that crying.

39
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,075
It's your job, Zé. You should
take care of your clients.

40
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,086
Look, I'm tired of all these people

41
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:28,047
Hey, where's the meat?

42
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:31,053
Not today. Did you forget
that today is Holy Friday?

43
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:38,071
What do I care
if it's Holy or Evil Friday?

44
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,302
I'll get what I want and
no religious fanatic will stop me.

45
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:46,081
I'll eat meat today,
even if it's human flesh!

46
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,247
Watch out, Zé!
The devil may be tempting you!

47
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:53,091
If I meet him,
I'll invite him for dinner.

48
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,330
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
What do you want?

49
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:08,476
Terezinha insisted on visiting
Lenita and invite her to the procession.

50
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,783
I think it is no use... But...

51
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:13,352
I will talk to her.

52
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,089
As you wish.
- Where are you going, Zé?

53
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,095
Well... I want to buy a lamb.

54
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:21,764
Save for Easter?

55
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,100
No, to eat today!

56
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,120
I'll go downstairs a little, Lenita.

57
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,591
I know who you saw!
It's that little woman.

58
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:01,339
You think I didn't notice the
way you looked at her this afternoon?

59
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,137
You know that I hate melodramatics!

60
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,131
I'm not a woman to be treated this way, Zé!

61
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,134
And stop bothering that girl.

62
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:14,149
At least have some respect
to your friendship with Antônio.

63
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:17,120
You have talked enough.

64
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,128
Antônio will be there soon.

65
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,311
I don't want to stay there too long.

66
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,406
Good evening.

67
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,133
Good evening.
- Good evening

68
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,416
Where are you going?

69
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:44,157
I'm taking Terezinha to Clemencia
and Antônio will pick her up later.

70
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,426
What a coincidence!

71
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,629
I'm going there too.

72
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,623
Don't worry. I'll take her.

73
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:52,755
Antônio may not like that, Sr. Zé.

74
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,173
Well... Antônio is my best friend, right?

75
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:58,633
So it seems.

76
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,647
You decide, Terezinha.

77
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,651
Well, if you have another appointment...

78
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,656
Ah, but he does.
Don't you, Aristides?

79
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,652
You have a very important appointment.
Isn't truth?

80
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,707
Yes. Now I remembered.
I do have an appointment, yes.

81
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,669
I'll appreciate if you could take her.

82
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:18,863
Good night, Terezinha.

83
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,439
Good night.
- Good night.

84
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,180
Thanks for allowing me to walk with you.

85
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,640
I don't see a reason to thank me.

86
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,663
Will Antônio take long to pick you up?

87
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,657
Not, he said that he would come soon.

88
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:44,672
Lucky man.

89
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:48,980
You know that I suffer with
Antônio's luck having you as his fiancée?

90
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:51,146
I think you're exaggerating.

91
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:54,651
I think I'm a happy woman
for having the love of Antônio.

92
00:11:57,724 --> 00:12:00,660
Eitheryou are silly,
or want to play with me.

93
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,848
You know you aren't
the woman for Antônio.

94
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,098
You are the woman for me!

95
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:06,844
Take your hands off me, Zé!
You're hurting me!

96
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:11,675
I want to see if your lips
are so defiant as your words!

97
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,687
You have the fangs of a snake...

98
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,667
and the face of an angel.

99
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,219
Antônio wouldn't know about this.

100
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,867
But I ask you for not
let thisscene happen again

101
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:39,679
Very well, I'll go with you.

102
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,684
Thanks.
I'd rather go alone.

103
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:23,706
Bring some wine, Maria.

104
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,957
Ranulfo.

105
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:40,963
Yes, Mr. Zé!

106
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,703
Go to my house and
ask Lenita to send me the lamb.

107
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:48,472
I'll be back soon.

108
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,729
It looks like a good game.
Very good.

109
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:07,699
There's room for one more?

110
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,705
Thanks! You're very kind.

111
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,711
Maria, more wine.

112
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,714
That man scares me, Mr. Francisco!

113
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,720
Don't let him see it,
or things gonna be worse.

114
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:26,992
I pass.

115
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:29,494
I double.

116
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,733
The bet are too high for me, too.

117
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:35,738
Looks like... just you and me.

118
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,007
Will you go on?

119
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,009
I double.

120
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:41,978
Brave man.

121
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,683
A real man got to be like this:

122
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,719
All... or nothing.

123
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,727
I pay a thousand to see your cards.

124
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:55,654
But, I-I... d-don't
have any more money.

125
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,733
No? Then show me your cards.

126
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:01,739
It's... three kings.

127
00:15:05,812 --> 00:15:07,747
Bad luck, my friend.

128
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:11,753
- Four aces.
- It is not possible!

129
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:15,023
Let go of the money, man!

130
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,727
I can't. I need the money!

131
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,007
Let go of the money!

132
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:06,760
My hand, my hand...

133
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:14,771
As I said: I like brave men!

134
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,043
Call the doctor.

135
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,016
I'll pay for the bill.
To.

136
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,756
Ah, you're my witnesses:

137
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:31,027
It was an accident.

138
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,030
Here's the meat, Mr. Zé.

139
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,769
Excellent, just in time.

140
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,776
Ascene like that can make
everyone hunger, right?

141
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:59,761
You, Bonifácio. You look hungry.

142
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,770
Have a piece of this lamb.

143
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,173
No, thanks, I don't want it.

144
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,042
Come here, boy!

145
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,789
Have a bite... It's very good.

146
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,574
- Today is a holy day, Mr. Zé.
I can't eat meat. - Eat it!

147
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,064
Please...

148
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:25,067
Eat it!

149
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,775
Ah, the doctor is here!

150
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:37,049
What's happening here?

151
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:38,875
An unfortunate accident, doctor.

152
00:17:39,854 --> 00:17:41,054
The victim is Zerequiel.

153
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:44,293
Take good care of him
and I'll pay all the bills.

154
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,448
Your kindness knows no bounds, Zé.

155
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,030
Thank you.

156
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,569
More wine, Maria!

157
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,003
Better take him to the hospital.

158
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,578
Very well.

159
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:08,986
You act as if you're afraid of me.

160
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,553
No, Mr. Zé.
I have othercustomers to take care.

161
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:18,306
Leave them to Chico, heh?

162
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:22,744
Tonight you work only for me,
what do you think?

163
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:25,306
What does he want with my niece?

164
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,699
Is no one here brave enough
to face this man?

165
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,813
- Then why don't you?
- That's what I'll do!

166
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:34,327
Zé, leave the girl alone!

167
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:36,590
And who's going to make me leave her?

168
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:38,299
I am, you emissary ofSatan!

169
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,738
Stop, Zé, stop!
You're going to kill the poor man!

170
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,348
Have mercy, Zé! Mercy...

171
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:43,320
I have enough work with those
who die of natural causes.

172
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,823
You can be sure:

173
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:50,319
I'll charge double to bury anyone I kill!

174
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,334
- Let's go home, Zé.
- Let's go.

175
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:09,355
Oh, I'm going to the crossroads
by the graveyard...

176
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,359
Anyone wants to follow me?

177
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:20,337
I was passing by with Terezinha
when I heard the screams.

178
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,330
What happened, Antônio?

179
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,777
- It's all right now.
- Thank goodness.

180
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:26,612
By the way, Antônio,

181
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:29,272
let's take a raincheck on that fishing.

182
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,617
It's up to you.

183
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,897
I'm going to take Terezinha home.
Want to come along?

184
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:38,361
But, Antônio, he has to go home.
Lenita is all alone.

185
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:43,369
Awoman who can't bear a child needs no care.

186
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,820
We'll talk tomorrow, Antônio.

187
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,681
- Good night.
- Good night.

188
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:56,895
Terezinha rejects me because
the existence of Lenita.

189
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:02,362
Is life worth living if there's no
son to continue the bloodline?

190
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,366
What's one mistress among so many women?

191
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,377
Lenita has to die...

192
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,382
Lenita has to die...

193
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,036
I'm so sorry about what happened.

194
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:22,393
Will you forgive me?
Tell me you aren't angry with me...

195
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,672
It's all right, Lenita.

196
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:28,376
You make me so happy!
I can't help but feeljealous.

197
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,382
I want to make you happy, my love!

198
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:36,389
Your wish will be fulfilled.

199
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,394
You're going to make me very happy.

200
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:13,405
This will be a very amusing show!

201
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,416
Awoman must belong to only one man.

202
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,419
Since you're of no use to me,

203
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,427
I'll do you a favor and spare you
of the sin of needing another man.

204
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:32,486
Is your life worth living
if you can't bear a child...

205
00:23:32,966 --> 00:23:34,433
to continue your bloodline?

206
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:52,425
You wouldn't be an obstacle
to the only truth of the existence.

207
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:55,695
Terezinha will be mine...

208
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:59,434
and from her womb my lineage will continue.

209
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,414
I'll have the honor of
seeing you die before my eyes.

210
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:17,425
Pity... You seemed so unique

211
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:24,434
Now there you are,
in the painful affliction of death!

212
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:30,442
You suffer, because you can't scream!

213
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:40,456
Lenita, now you leave me and
become the death's mistress.

214
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:59,448
It was a great show! Thank you!

215
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:26,476
Let's make sure the doctor
takes good care of you.

216
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,105
There's nothing more to do.
She was bitten by a spider.

217
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,908
Poor girl. It must have been so painful.

218
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,308
I'll file the report for the police officer.

219
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:51,452
Very well, doctor.
I'll take care of the rest.

220
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:53,722
Well, goodbye.

221
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:11,019
I want to go home, I want to go home...
- Be quiet, boy, or I'll beat you!

222
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:12,748
Quiet!

223
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:15,932
- Ah, you...
- I want to go...

224
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:18,489
Don't abuse your child!

225
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,459
He's the continuity of your blood.

226
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,468
A real man doesn't cry.

227
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,476
Take your son... but don't hurt him.

228
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:46,494
It's been fifteen days since Lenita died.

229
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,904
I miss hervery much.

230
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,638
Of course you do.
Lenita loved you very much,

231
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,565
and I know that you loved her too.

232
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,486
Yes. One day everything comes to an end.

233
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,491
We are born... and then die.

234
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:14,499
That's life.
We have got to accept that.

235
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,505
Ah... What ifwe go fishing tomorrow?

236
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:21,774
Okay.

237
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:23,777
Oh, Zé, one more thing.

238
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,866
- What?
- Do you want to visit the gypsy with us?

239
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:28,483
Do what?

240
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,534
Terezinha insisted.
She wants to know her future.

241
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,412
You know, women about to get married...

242
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:36,892
- And you, do you want to go?
- Well, we always have some doubt, right?

243
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,778
I'll go.

244
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:56,512
It'll be fun to see two
superstitious under the spell of a witch.

245
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:09,773
Good evening!

246
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:11,957
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

247
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:13,502
Come in, my children!

248
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,505
Make yourselves at home.
Have a seat.

249
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:37,510
- I'd like to know...
- Say no more!

250
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,517
Look into my eyes,
and I'll tell you your future.

251
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:44,510
Beware, my child! Beware

252
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,525
Happiness is yours.

253
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,404
But don't forget who you love,
and everything will be right.

254
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:55,535
Otherwise there will be death...
misfortune...

255
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:59,541
Read my future now.
Who knows, it may be a little better

256
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:04,547
Your lifeline ends right here!

257
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:07,921
Don't think of your earthly life,
and everything will go well.

258
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:09,787
Fulfill your soul.

259
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,448
Don't allow the earth to
receive your body in broad daylight.

260
00:29:13,594 --> 00:29:18,533
Your salvation demands
that you be buried at midnight!

261
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:22,538
Stop that nonsense, you old witch!

262
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,798
Forgive me, but I can't stand
this foolishness.

263
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,547
In your eyes I see your fate.

264
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:31,550
You'll pay for your sins,

265
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:34,990
and when the time comes,
you'll suffer the horrors of hell!

266
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,559
You go to hell!

267
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:40,248
Let's go home, Terezinha.
How much?

268
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,531
You don't have to pay me.

269
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:47,539
The laws of the supernatural forbid me
to accept money when death is foretold.

270
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:51,544
Go, my children. Beware.

271
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:10,779
Well, Terezinha,
let's forget that gypsy woman

272
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:13,007
and think about what to do tomorrow.

273
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:15,976
I know. The hard work will be all mine.

274
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:19,804
You'll have a good night's sleep,
and want me to wake you up, right?

275
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,553
So, it's all set? Let's go, Antônio.

276
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,289
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

277
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,825
Good night.

278
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:30,009
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I feel restless.

279
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:31,917
A good bath will cure that.

280
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:35,015
- Come over, and have a drink with me.
- Very well.

281
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,598
Try this wine, Zé.
I think you'll like it.

282
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,586
Drinking is the best way
to ward off the evil spirits.

283
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:50,338
As if you believed in such things...

284
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:56,565
If I believe it or not, in fact
I must agree with the believers.

285
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:59,570
Frankly, I don't understand you, Zé.

286
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,021
Where does all your disbelief came from?

287
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,567
It's like a rebellion. Against what?

288
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,583
You have a lot to learn, Antônio.

289
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:13,589
I can't disbelieve,
when I never had any belief.

290
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:19,597
To believe in what? In a symbol?

291
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,809
In an non-existent force
created by ignorance?

292
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:28,007
Yes, I'm a rebel...
against fools like you,

293
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,579
who fear what you don't see,

294
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:34,584
and become slaves to that
which really exists: Life!!

295
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:37,588
I don't know why I should fear life.

296
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:45,595
Because it's life
that makes your flesh throb.

297
00:31:46,668 --> 00:31:51,608
Life feeds your feelings,
and if you aren't strong...

298
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,015
not to fight it, you'll be
dominated, and will suffer.

299
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,588
Take a look at your people

300
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,594
Why do they fear me?

301
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:10,599
Because I use black clothes?
Because I believe in myself?

302
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,603
Because I laugh at their beliefs?

303
00:32:15,674 --> 00:32:18,610
No. Because I'm stronger
than then, and I have brain...

304
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,047
enough to dominate whoever that it is.

305
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:24,635
They're weak, because they're
enslaved by what they don't know.

306
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:28,590
I'm free.
Therefore, I'm stronger.

307
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,028
You may have your reasons,
but I'm happy the way I am.

308
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,618
I love Terezinha and I know she loves me.

309
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,147
I don't have any innerconflict.

310
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:41,608
I want only to marry her,
and I know that will happen soon.

311
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:46,046
We like the same things.
I feel good believing in God.

312
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,619
I can't be a rebel against everyone.

313
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,624
You know, Terezinha is like an angel.

314
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,629
We're going to remodel this house...

315
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:00,634
and live here together
for the rest of our lives.

316
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,605
That is my biggest desire.

317
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,620
What was all that faith good for?

318
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,623
I'm stronger than you!

319
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:24,643
Antônio! Antônio!

320
00:36:27,748 --> 00:36:29,114
Antônio? Antô...

321
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,700
I don't know, Barretos.
It was quite a shock to me.

322
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:45,739
Believe me, I would give my own life
for Antônio's.

323
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:47,756
Don't think that I'm accusing you.

324
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,919
But you were the last person
to see him alive,

325
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,715
so you must remain a suspect
until we have an autopsy

326
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:55,985
Excuse me...

327
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,691
Commissioner, the doctor needs you.

328
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,381
Excuse me.
I must go to the morgue.

329
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,384
I'm going to my funerary,
and later I'll meet you there.

330
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,967
Very well.

331
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:36,708
"In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit".

332
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:38,978
Antônio! Antônio!

333
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:41,981
Antônio!

334
00:37:55,802 --> 00:37:57,002
Murderer!

335
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:00,740
Damn you! Murderer!

336
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:02,605
Calm down... Take her outside.

337
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:04,712
You killed Antônio! Murderer!

338
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,708
Try to calm her down.

339
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:18,722
Close the casket.

340
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:33,770
So soon we won't forget
Antônio's funeral.

341
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:37,156
They say he was buried
at midnight to save his soul.

342
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:41,161
He must have something wrong with him,
because he was Zé's friend.

343
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,431
We should run that man out of town!

344
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,277
He's got an eye forTerezinha...

345
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:47,737
And the girl is at home all alone.

346
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:51,617
Her father went to the city
to see his wife at the hospital.

347
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:53,011
Look who's here.

348
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,169
Maria, bring me a bottle ofwine.

349
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,793
Hey, did you change your name to Maria?

350
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,715
Leave the bottle there;
put there, old man! Leave it!

351
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:26,757
I asked her to serve me.
I'm waiting, girl.

352
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
Come here.

353
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,245
How much for the bird?

354
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,715
But, it's not for sale.

355
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,951
What's the price?

356
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,789
Well, I don't know. I don't know.

357
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:53,526
Is two thousand enough?

358
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:55,261
Great... great!

359
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:56,863
I'll take the bird.

360
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,812
We'll talk some other day.

361
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:18,694
What now?

362
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,229
You never seen a little bird?

363
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:25,793
Or shall I take the measurements
for your coffins?

364
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:01,812
Oh, what do you want here so late?

365
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:05,825
Don't be afraid. I brought you a present.

366
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:08,290
Thank you. Good night.

367
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:11,297
Hold on, girl. Show some manners.

368
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,873
Please, Zé. What will the neighbors think?

369
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:23,715
Don't worry.

370
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:26,752
They will not think anything.

371
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:32,544
This people don't have the guts
to go out in the streets at this hour.

372
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:35,347
What are you going to do with the bird?

373
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,748
Throw it away.
You don't want to accept my present.

374
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,306
Oh, no! Poor thing!

375
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:45,311
He must be hungry, poor one.

376
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,850
I knew you had a kind heart.

377
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:52,316
Please, you're hurting me!

378
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:53,923
- You...
- Have mercy...

379
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:56,692
- You wouldn't treat Antônio like that.
- Go away!

380
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:59,297
Don't talk about Antônio. Go away!

381
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:03,298
After all I did to rid you of that fool,

382
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:05,538
you tell me to go away?

383
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:07,574
Don't touch me!

384
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:09,310
Respect me, Zé.

385
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,809
- You ain't easy. But I like the hard way.
- No! No!

386
00:42:13,383 --> 00:42:17,321
I want you to be mine.
And I always get what I want.

387
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:20,592
No! Help!

388
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:23,329
No! No!

389
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,335
Snake from hell.

390
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,273
You'll be very quiet.

391
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:34,577
Help!

392
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:39,318
No! No!

393
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:45,326
Help! Help!

394
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,614
No! No!

395
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,600
Mercy!

396
00:43:16,403 --> 00:43:20,340
That's right, this is the way I like it.

397
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,344
You'll give me the son I want.

398
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:28,366
You've ruined me, Zé.
I can't go on living.

399
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:31,637
I'm going to kill myself.

400
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:50,362
It's always like that...

401
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:58,372
All women say the same thing.

402
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:01,241
Later they regret it.

403
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:12,915
Life is good,
it's not worth trading for death.

404
00:45:19,436 --> 00:45:21,371
I'll be back some other time, Terezinha.

405
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:31,385
I'll kill myself, Zé,
but I promise you'll not have any peace

406
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:35,390
You killed Antônio
and he was buried at midnight.

407
00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:42,390
And at midnight, Zé, you'll know fear,
because I'll come to take your soul!

408
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:46,406
Whereveryou take me,
if there are women like you,

409
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:49,375
I'll be happy to go!

410
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:52,379
Excuse me...

411
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:19,950
Today is my lucky day.

412
00:46:22,454 --> 00:46:24,389
The devil himself is here, right?

413
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,405
Spirits!

414
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:10,685
Spirits!

415
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:15,425
Do you hear me?

416
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:19,431
Which of you is going to take my soul?

417
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:25,438
Behold... I'm waiting!

418
00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:31,413
Arise! Out of your graves...

419
00:47:32,484 --> 00:47:36,420
and take me straight to hell!

420
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:40,426
Can't you hear me?

421
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:47,436
Can't you hear me?
Take me straight to hell!

422
00:47:51,509 --> 00:47:54,445
Antônio!

423
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:57,448
I possessed Terezinha.

424
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,443
What will you do to me?

425
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:02,421
Nothing!

426
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:06,427
Because you no longer exist!

427
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:09,432
You're dead!

428
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:13,438
Dead!

429
00:48:25,521 --> 00:48:30,459
Your hour is coming.
Your end is near.

430
00:48:31,529 --> 00:48:35,433
You'll feel the burden of your sins.

431
00:48:36,002 --> 00:48:37,436
Shut up,

432
00:48:38,005 --> 00:48:39,438
old witch.

433
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:42,443
I'll make your coffin.

434
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:49,451
Scom the living!

435
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:52,456
Mock the dead!

436
00:48:53,025 --> 00:48:57,464
You'll live the horrors from hell!

437
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,452
With these few lines, I ask my parents
for forgiveness, for my condemnable act.

438
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:15,453
There's nobody to blame in this tragedy, I
couldn't support the weight on my shoulders.

439
00:49:15,522 --> 00:49:16,455
If must have a sentence
for the reason of my death,

440
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:17,455
I'll be the judge, and wherever I may
be, justice will be fulfilled. Terezinha

441
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:18,989
How can we charge him,

442
00:49:19,494 --> 00:49:21,590
if she left a note explaining
why she did it?

443
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:24,009
There's something strange here.

444
00:49:24,534 --> 00:49:28,471
I can't figure why she didn't
put the blame on Zé do Caixão

445
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:48,732
Idiot!

446
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:52,471
She had the courage to kill herself.

447
00:49:58,047 --> 00:50:01,485
Strange... she didn't blame me.

448
00:50:19,543 --> 00:50:23,480
Let his soul rest in peace.

449
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:32,492
Her father insisted
she be buried next to Antônio.

450
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:48,479
Through this letter,
I came to the autorities...

451
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:49,481
to request urgent autorization...

452
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,482
to proceed a new autopsy
on Antônio's corpse.

453
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:51,483
Thinking about the last events
occurred in this city,

454
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:53,535
I came to believe that
we are dealing with...

455
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:55,490
homi...

456
00:50:59,063 --> 00:51:01,031
Good evening, doctor

457
00:51:09,576 --> 00:51:11,511
Did I frighten you?

458
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:19,522
Hmm... savior of mankind!

459
00:51:20,591 --> 00:51:22,492
But the people doesn't care for that.

460
00:51:23,562 --> 00:51:25,039
The report is only a formality.

461
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:32,508
Sorry I'm so curious
to read your work, but...

462
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:38,514
As they say, eyes are made for seeing.

463
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:41,519
What are you trying to do, Zé?

464
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,790
Nothing.

465
00:51:45,593 --> 00:51:50,531
Just making sure your eyes
don't see what they shouldn't

466
00:52:19,605 --> 00:52:20,805
Sorry, doctor.

467
00:53:26,629 --> 00:53:29,566
You make me so happy!
I can't help but feeljealous.

468
00:53:30,635 --> 00:53:32,207
I want so much to make you happy!

469
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:45,554
We're going to remodel this house and live
here together for the rest of our lives.

470
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:50,560
At midnight, Zé, you'll know fear,
because I'll come to take your soul!

471
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:54,031
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- I want to make you happy!

472
00:53:54,634 --> 00:53:56,349
Together, for the rest of our lives.

473
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:58,037
I'll come to take your soul!

474
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,974
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy!

475
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:03,979
I'll come to take your soul!

476
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,572
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy

477
00:54:07,151 --> 00:54:08,550
For the rest of our lives.

478
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,554
I'll come to take your soul!

479
00:54:11,056 --> 00:54:13,390
- What are you trying to do, Zé?
- Make you happy!

480
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:16,562
Lenita!

481
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,576
Antônio!

482
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,585
Rodolfo!

483
00:54:46,637 --> 00:54:48,572
You're all dead.

484
00:54:53,648 --> 00:54:56,116
I did it foryou, Terezinha.

485
00:54:59,655 --> 00:55:01,590
You've forsaken me.

486
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,601
You didn't give me a son.

487
00:55:11,672 --> 00:55:14,607
You've doomed my bloodline to extinction.

488
00:55:16,644 --> 00:55:19,581
I want a son!

489
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:25,588
Damn you! Curse your faith!

490
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:32,599
Terezinha!

491
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,602
Come out of nowhere...

492
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:40,609
and punish the crime of my passion!

493
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:45,616
Torture my flesh!

494
00:55:47,687 --> 00:55:51,590
Take my soul!

495
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:55,596
Why don't you come?

496
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:59,602
You're a ghost from the past.

497
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:12,619
Yet, I feel the blood boiling in my veins.

498
00:56:13,689 --> 00:56:15,623
I'm alive!

499
00:56:16,693 --> 00:56:19,629
Alive, understood?

500
00:56:20,698 --> 00:56:22,599
You are dead!

501
00:56:23,669 --> 00:56:24,869
Rotted!

502
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,608
Eaten by worms!

503
00:56:35,686 --> 00:56:38,622
HEAVEN!

504
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:43,628
HELL!

505
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:48,635
REINCARNATION!

506
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,612
The power offaith!

507
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,617
Symbol of ignorance!

508
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:10,631
Where are you, Satan?

509
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,638
Lies! Lies!

510
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,645
May the earth crack open!

511
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:23,649
May the skies be torn!

512
00:57:27,722 --> 00:57:31,626
I want the end of the world!

513
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:42,642
I challenge your power!

514
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:45,645
I deny your existence!

515
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:52,655
Nothing exists. Only life

516
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:57,662
Nothing's stronger than my disbelief

517
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:03,635
Destroy me! I have no faith.

518
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:09,645
I want the proof of the punishment!

519
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:18,657
Lies!

520
00:58:50,734 --> 00:58:54,137
What an unfortunate accident.
Asad loss for our town.

521
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,676
Such is life. Excuse me, gentlemen.

522
00:59:01,749 --> 00:59:03,684
Evidence! Evidence, my friends.

523
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,665
Well, it's nine o'clock.

524
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:17,135
Today is Day of the Dead.
Time to go home.

525
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,641
Yes. The night is pitch black.

526
00:59:22,244 --> 00:59:23,677
I should be going, too.

527
00:59:24,247 --> 00:59:26,009
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow

528
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:30,688
What's the hurry, fellas?

529
00:59:31,757 --> 00:59:34,091
Today is the Day of the Dead.
We shouldn't be out.

530
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,161
To believe such ridiculous nonsense.

531
00:59:36,764 --> 00:59:37,696
It's not nonsense, Mr. Zé.

532
00:59:37,932 --> 00:59:40,248
Last year Gumercindo scoffed, and had the
punishment.

533
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:41,551
He saw the wandering ghosts.

534
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:43,905
It's true, Mr. Zé.
You shouldn't make fun tonight.

535
00:59:44,742 --> 00:59:46,838
Oryou'll may watch
the Procession of the Dead

536
00:59:48,747 --> 00:59:51,683
Procession of the Dead...
It's a bedtime story forchildren.

537
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,753
Everyone has a right to their own beliefs.

538
00:59:55,757 --> 00:59:57,691
Okay then, you win!

539
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,962
No more talk of that.

540
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,575
Now you won't go home.
Stay and have a drink with me, right?

541
01:00:07,773 --> 01:00:09,708
Anyone turning me down?

542
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:11,977
Not at all, Mr. Zé.

543
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:13,803
I like men with strong opinions.

544
01:00:14,783 --> 01:00:16,069
Chico, drinks for everyone.

545
01:00:31,772 --> 01:00:33,249
Don't you want a drink, fellas?

546
01:00:33,775 --> 01:00:35,709
Come, have a drink! Drink!

547
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:42,986
Maria.

548
01:00:48,762 --> 01:00:51,698
Here's a small gift for being so kind to me.

549
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:55,703
No, Mr. Zé, I can't accept it.
Look, my uncle is coming.

550
01:00:57,774 --> 01:00:59,709
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

551
01:01:03,214 --> 01:01:05,405
I'm here to pick you up, Maria.
It's very late.

552
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:08,309
I was just about to leave,
if Bonifácio can follow me.

553
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,492
Were you paid today?

554
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,794
No, uncle, Mr. Zé gave it to me as a gift.

555
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:22,705
Take your money back!
My niece will take no gift from you.

556
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:27,713
I gave her the money,
and I want her to have it.

557
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:31,021
If you'll not take it back,
it stays right here.

558
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:34,488
Let's go, Maria.

559
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:41,998
Old man.

560
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:44,001
Pick up that money!

561
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:54,783
Pick up that money! NOW!

562
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:58,245
Enough! This man has pushed
us around for too long!

563
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:01,578
Time to settle it for good!

564
01:02:02,228 --> 01:02:05,721
I'll not pick up that money!
I'll not pick up that money!

565
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,268
What will you do to me now?

566
01:02:08,803 --> 01:02:11,272
What will you do to me now, Zé do Caixão?

567
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:13,275
What will you do to me now?

568
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,210
What will you do to me now?

569
01:02:15,813 --> 01:02:18,748
I'll not pick up that money,
do you undertand, Zé do Caixão?

570
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,152
I'll not pick up that money!

571
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:26,760
Uncle, uncle...

572
01:02:32,803 --> 01:02:34,003
Pick up that money!

573
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:37,741
I'm going to count to three...

574
01:02:38,811 --> 01:02:40,011
One...

575
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:45,018
Two...

576
01:02:49,826 --> 01:02:52,762
THREE!

577
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,040
Give it to your niece.

578
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,040
Good evening, gentlemen.

579
01:03:54,847 --> 01:03:57,943
It's all closed in this town.
This is the only place I found open.

580
01:03:58,351 --> 01:04:00,447
There was nowhere
I could go for information.

581
01:04:00,856 --> 01:04:02,789
How can we help you, ma'am?

582
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,319
I'd like to know
where the Queiroz family's house is.

583
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:09,313
I'm here to visit her, but there was
no one to pick me up at the station,

584
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:12,770
because I missed the afternoon train.

585
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,989
But, lady, Mrs. Matilde
lives far from here...

586
01:04:16,009 --> 01:04:17,772
Her house is beyond the cemetery.

587
01:04:18,346 --> 01:04:20,156
But could anyone of you take me there?

588
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:22,784
Not tonight, you'll not find anyone.

589
01:04:23,052 --> 01:04:24,782
I'm willing to pay.

590
01:04:25,355 --> 01:04:27,165
No money in the world would be enough.

591
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:30,120
Today is Day of the Dead,
and no one goes out at this hour.

592
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:31,561
What am I going to do?

593
01:04:31,864 --> 01:04:34,848
I don't know anyone in town and,
for what I saw, there are no hotels.

594
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:36,068
Don't worry.

595
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:40,808
If you'll allow me,
I'd be honored to escort you.

596
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:54,327
I'm at your service.

597
01:04:55,863 --> 01:04:58,816
I appreciate it, gentleman.
I don't know how could I thank you.

598
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:02,804
My reward is to walk
with such a beautiful lady.

599
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:04,807
You are very kind.

600
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:08,014
You could stay at my place tonight
and I'll take you tomorrow.

601
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,815
Thanks. But I'd rather go tonight.

602
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:16,322
Any other question, gentlemen?

603
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,797
If any of you think yourselves
brave enough

604
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:25,802
I'll gladly step aside.

605
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:30,074
Let's go?

606
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:42,826
Ah, by the way...

607
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:46,192
If I meet a corpse along the way,

608
01:05:47,399 --> 01:05:51,804
I'll send him your regards!

609
01:05:56,378 --> 01:05:59,314
I noticed that the people here
are very superstitious.

610
01:05:59,783 --> 01:06:02,593
They try to cover their fear,
they're all a bunch of cowards

611
01:06:02,787 --> 01:06:05,312
- Aren't you afraid?
- Of spirits from beyond?

612
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:09,319
I may fearsome of the living,
but I can protect myselffrom them.

613
01:06:09,763 --> 01:06:13,757
Well, you'll have to admit that
the night is really cold and dark

614
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:15,602
A night like any other.

615
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,571
How many births and deaths
are happening this very night?

616
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:21,575
You're right;
I don't believe in this nonsense, either...

617
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:27,753
Don't be frightened. It's the old witch!

618
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:29,754
Beware!

619
01:06:30,392 --> 01:06:33,361
Beware of the DEAD!

620
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:35,761
Go to hell, sorceress!

621
01:06:36,399 --> 01:06:40,337
When you hear the wind blowing
over the trees,

622
01:06:40,806 --> 01:06:46,336
it'll not be the wind...
but the wandering ghosts.

623
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:48,338
Don't wait until midnight.

624
01:06:48,816 --> 01:06:52,344
When you see a black cat in your path,
it'll be the Devil.

625
01:06:52,821 --> 01:06:56,315
When you hear footsteps
and there's no one behind you,

626
01:06:57,394 --> 01:07:00,330
it'll be the damnation of your soul.

627
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,327
When you hear the death call of the owl,

628
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:06,774
it'll be the harbinger of your end.

629
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:09,342
Don't wait until midnight.

630
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:11,336
When you see light in your path,

631
01:07:12,414 --> 01:07:15,350
it'll be the candles
of the Procession of the Dead.

632
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,620
RUN AWAY!

633
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:23,361
Because they'll come for your soul!

634
01:07:26,434 --> 01:07:28,006
My God, what a horrible laughter!

635
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:31,329
I'll take care of you on my way back, witch!

636
01:07:32,408 --> 01:07:34,343
Let's go, my dear.

637
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:46,360
Well, here we are,
and now I bid you farewell.

638
01:07:46,828 --> 01:07:48,352
But why? Would you like come in?

639
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:50,631
Thank you.

640
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,362
I don't get along with your aunt,
and I'd rather not be seen by her.

641
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,808
Well, I hope to see you again before I go.

642
01:07:58,443 --> 01:08:00,378
Don't worry. I'll make sure of that.

643
01:08:00,847 --> 01:08:02,337
My name is Marta Queiroz.

644
01:08:02,816 --> 01:08:06,344
I am Zé... to my friends.

645
01:08:09,826 --> 01:08:12,352
Hmm, looks like someone is coming.
I should go.

646
01:08:13,431 --> 01:08:16,367
- So long, Marta.
- Good night, Zé.

647
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:27,372
She's pretty.

648
01:08:30,854 --> 01:08:35,383
If I play right, she won't escape me.

649
01:08:56,856 --> 01:09:00,385
When you hear the wind blowing
over the trees,

650
01:09:01,864 --> 01:09:06,393
it'll not be the wind...
but the wandering ghosts.

651
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:37,410
When you see a black cat in your path,
it'll be the Devil.

652
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,414
Don't wait until midnight.

653
01:10:55,449 --> 01:10:57,418
Who's following me?

654
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:00,423
Who wants to play with me?

655
01:11:01,492 --> 01:11:05,429
Look out! Look out! I'll shoot!

656
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:29,428
When you hear footsteps
and there's no one behind you,

657
01:11:30,497 --> 01:11:32,432
it'll be the damnation of your soul.

658
01:11:33,501 --> 01:11:35,436
Don't wait until midnight.

659
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:13,454
I must be impressionable tonight.
It was only an owl.

660
01:12:16,527 --> 01:12:18,462
When you hear the death call of the owl,

661
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:21,465
it'll be the harbinger of your end.

662
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:23,773
Don't wait until midnight.

663
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,450
A light?

664
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:00,500
I'm safe! I'm safe!

665
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:26,493
It'll be the candles
of the Procession of the Dead.

666
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:31,507
No, no... it can't be real!

667
01:14:32,577 --> 01:14:34,511
It must be an hallucination!

668
01:18:52,664 --> 01:18:58,605
No, no... no!

669
01:19:00,675 --> 01:19:03,611
Lies!

670
01:19:11,656 --> 01:19:12,856
No, no...

671
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:38,624
They are dead! DEAD!

672
01:19:39,694 --> 01:19:42,595
I know it... I KNOW IT!

673
01:19:43,665 --> 01:19:47,603
No... I must see them.
I must see them!

674
01:19:48,673 --> 01:19:49,873
I must see them.

675
01:19:51,676 --> 01:19:55,614
No... I don't believe it!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

676
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:05,628
Lies! Lies! Lies!

677
01:20:57,699 --> 01:21:00,635
There was a terrible noise.
I was too frightened to go alone.

678
01:21:01,704 --> 01:21:03,639
Something must have happened here.

679
01:22:07,727 --> 01:22:13,668
THE END

4
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:31,979
The learned Rabbi Loew reads in the
stars that misfortune threatens the Jews.

5
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:21,396
I must speak with Rabbi Jehuda,
danger threatens our people.

6
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:24,062
Call all the elders of the
community together to pray.

00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:27,895
The stars predict disaster.

<i>AGAINST THE JEWS</i>

9
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,520
<i>We can no longer neglect</i>
<i>the popular complaints against the Jews.</i>

10
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:59,721
<i>They despise the holy Christian ceremonies;</i>
<i>They endanger the lives and property...</i>

11
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:04,021
<i>...of their fellow men;</i>
<i>They practice black magic.</i>

12
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:08,118
<i>We decree that all Jews shall leave the</i>
<i>city and all territory in sight of the city...</i>

13
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,846
<i>...before the month is ended.</i>

Knight Florian, deliver
our edict to the Ghetto.

Venus enters the constellation of Libra!
The auspicious hour has come...

16
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:11,021
...to summon the dread spirit Astaroth,
and compel him to reveal the magic word.

17
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:16,812
Then we can bring the Golem
to life to save our people.

18
00:12:55,603 --> 00:13:00,521
A messenger from the
Emperor is here.

19
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:41,186
Come with me to the High Rabbi Loew, who
is like a father to our whole community.

20
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,021
It was I who drew the Emperor's horoscope.
I warned him twice of danger.

21
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:18,353
Tell him now that I humbly
request an audience with him.

22
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:27,121

24
00:17:56,478 --> 00:18:02,353
The hour has come.
The stars favor the wizard.

25
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:10,352
Guard this secret
with your life.

26
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:37,852
Knight Florian brings
the Emperor's answer.

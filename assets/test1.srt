3
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:23,908
Awake already?

4
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:25,606
It’s so cold.

5
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:27,945
It’s too early to get up.

6
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:30,812
Let's sleep a little longer.

7
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,923
I couldn't sleep all night.

8
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,486
I know.

9
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:42,190
I had the same problem
when I started here.

10
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:46,333
You're so stylish and refined.

11
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,702
What are you doing
working as a serving girl?

12
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:56,441
I took a liking to you
as soon as i saw you yesterday.

13
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,374
Come on...

14
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,685
hold me tight.

15
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,184
That tickles.

16
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,826
You have such
a beautiful body.

17
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:14,898
Don't you like women?

18
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:20,904
In that case...

19
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:33,967
It’s the same every morning
before he goes to the fish market.

20
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:13,445
- Let's play that association game.
- I'll go first.

21
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,415
Hairy legs.

22
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,650
Crabs.

23
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,653
Chastity.

24
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:22,754
Men.

25
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,258
What are you kids up to?

26
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,924
Stop it!
Leave the poor man alone!

27
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,301
What are you doing here?

28
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,507
How awful!

29
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,424
What are you doing?

30
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:59,995
Get out of here,
you little brats!

31
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,233
It’s you!

32
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,933
- What's gotten into you?
- Osaka -

33
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:15,704
Let her go!

34
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,848
Keep your filthy hands off her!

35
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:27,082
I can't remember.
What was your name?

36
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,721
Was it in Osaka?

37
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:35,498
Nagoya? Tokyo?

38
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,632
You were so cheerful and kind.

39
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:43,171
I was your customer.

40
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,603
Don't you remember me?

41
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:47,802
I’ve never seen you before.

42
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,810
I want you now!

43
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:52,006
Look, I have money!

44
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,528
Please, just this once.

45
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,861
You just won't give up.

46
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,579
- You haven't changed at all.
- Hurry up.

47
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,943
You really don't remember me?

48
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:31,645
Nope.

49
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,727
What's wrong? It’s limp.

50
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,996
Are you cold?

51
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:46,330
If you just let me see your...

52
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,836
What a pain!

53
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,522
You'll catch cold.

54
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,690
You'd better just forget it.

55
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:22,732
Go on now.

56
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,704
Don't stand there singing!
Hurry up!

57
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,578
Where have you been?

58
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:32,546
Stop dawdling
and take this in right away.

59
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:36,676
You're working in a proper inn.
It’s not as easy as being a whore.

60
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:39,686
What are you staring at?

61
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,927
Stop it!

62
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,460
- Go to hell!
- Stop it!

63
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,655
I said stop!

64
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,330
- What's all this about?
- Once a whore, always a whore!

65
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,673
I’ll kill her!

66
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:58,706
Stop it!

67
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:02,039
So what if i was?
You think you're better than me?

68
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:03,612
Stop it!

69
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:05,475
You're to blame too.

70
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,210
Watch what you say!
We all have to work together.

71
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,547
I expect you both to apologize!

72
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,485
Out of my way!

73
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,594
What's going on?

74
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,994
It’s practically a brawl in here.

75
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,569
Who are you?

76
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,799
You new here?

77
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,871
What's your name?

78
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:36,973
Sada.

79
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,545
Sada Abe.

80
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:47,387
Lucky you came when you did.
Now i wonder just where you were.

81
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:54,697
You've got such pretty hands.

82
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:00,401
Why hold that knife when you
could be holding something else?

83
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:15,252
What a nice view.

84
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,360
No, don't stop.
Go on working.

85
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,700
<i>Don't play with fire</i>

86
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,437
I like the sway of your hips.

87
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,340
I bet you've broken
many a man's heart.

88
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:50,777
<i>I will pierce you through</i>

89
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,617
How many hearts
have you broken?

90
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,897
Master...

91
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,467
You're hurting my hand.

92
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:16,172
That hurts.

93
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,076
Master...

94
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,280
I’m a married woman -

95
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:23,079
I’ve heard all about it.

96
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,223
Your husband's business failed.

97
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,888
Now you both have to work.

98
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,655
That's right.

99
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:35,826
Must be hard.

100
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,699
You're...

101
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,440
a woman with a past,
aren't you?

102
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:49,204
I only came here because i heard
this was an upstanding house.

103
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,247
Is that so?
Well, as you see...

104
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:57,178
I’m an upstanding man.

105
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:10,391
Aren't you done yet?
Hurry up!

106
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:18,404
<i>Bonds</i>

107
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:23,837
<i>Between friends</i>

108
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:33,052
<i>Can never be broken</i>

109
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:36,326
Master,
are you alone tonight?

110
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,456
I stopped drinking out,

111
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,326
so tonight
I’ll be your customer.

112
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,991
Why did you stop drinking out?

113
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,628
So i can do this instead.

114
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:12,161
Madam sent me.
She said there was a customer.

115
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:14,523
That's me.

116
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,896
<i>What is this</i>

117
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,833
<i>Narrow path</i>

118
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,370
See how wet you are?

119
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,781
Let's not waste time.
Come on.

120
00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:59,636
That feels so good.

121
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,876
If you go on, I’ll -

122
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,091
What if the geisha comes?

123
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,317
We'll get in trouble.

124
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:19,725
- You want me to stop?
- No!

125
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,194
It’s driving me mad.

126
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:27,269
How is it driving you mad?

127
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,497
How?

128
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:36,675
<i>Good evening.</i>

129
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,441
<i>Thank you for sending for me.</i>
<i>I’m your geisha, Yaeji.</i>

130
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,585
Just a moment, please.

131
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,450
I’m a bit busy right now.

132
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,714
<i>Please take your time.</i>

133
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,210
Come in, Yaeji.

134
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:15,883
Sorry i kept you waiting.

135
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,252
Good evening.

136
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,634
What a lovely young girl!

137
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:39,736
<i>In the white snow...</i>

138
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,651
Where are you going?

139
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,259
To the toilet.

140
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:05,459
I’ll be waiting.

141
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:08,605
I don't have to go
right this minute.

142
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,476
They say it feels better
with a full bladder.

143
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:26,282
Take your time.
There's no hurry.

144
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,722
But Master...

145
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,026
last night i -

146
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,499
It’s all right.

147
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,665
I want you to feel good.

148
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,829
Your pleasure is enough.

149
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:48,110
I’m holding back for you.

150
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:19,337
You're going to make love
to your wife later, aren't you?

151
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,044
What a slut,
having sex every morning.

152
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,821
So you've seen us?
Have you been watching?

153
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:40,521
I won't let you go
until you've come.

154
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,300
Don't worry about that.

155
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,400
Let's take our time
and enjoy it.

156
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:54,771
But It’s already dawn.

157
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:56,810
Who cares?

158
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,793
You're an unusual woman.

159
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:45,615
<i>My hair</i>

160
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:49,156
<i>Is out of place</i>

161
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:53,757
<i>Only because</i>

162
00:18:53,931 --> 00:18:56,456
<i>Of my pillow</i>

163
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:59,667
<i>Yet i know</i>

164
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:09,842
<i>You don't believe me...</i>

165
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,411
Master, I can't play anymore.

166
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,253
You have to keep playing.

167
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:26,829
I told my wife you'd be playing
the shamisen for me tonight.

168
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:30,660
If you stop,
she'll get suspicious.

169
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:33,498
Why don't you sing instead?

170
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,834
Just a little longer.

171
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:47,008
<i>It’s my job</i>

172
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:51,653
<i>It’s a prostitute's life</i>

173
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,218
<i>Forgive me</i>

174
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:02,723
<i>The warbler in the tree</i>
<i>by the shed</i>

175
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:06,398
<i>On the second branch</i>
<i>from the top</i>

176
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:10,129
<i>Sprinkled vinegar</i>
<i>with grass held in her beak</i>

177
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:15,572
<i>And then laid 12 eggs</i>

178
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,809
<i>The first was a nightingale</i>

179
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,744
<i>The second was a kingfisher</i>

180
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,748
<i>The third was a wren</i>

181
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,614
<i>The fourth was a night crow</i>

182
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,778
<i>The fifth was a woodpecker</i>

183
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:27,685
<i>The sixth was a starling</i>

184
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:31,427
<i>The seventh was a plover</i>

185
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:33,290
<i>The eighth was a pheasant</i>

186
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,930
<i>The ninth was a robin</i>

187
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:40,036
<i>The tenth and eleventh...</i>

188
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:52,515
Excuse me, ma'am.

189
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,345
I’m sorry to disturb you.

190
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,350
Oh, hello. What is it?

191
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:02,153
I’m sorry
if this is very sudden,

192
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:06,456
but i request permission
to leave your employ.

193
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:10,431
Well, this is quite a surprise.

194
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,627
We can discuss it,
but for now please change this water.

195
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:11,321
I’m very happy with your work.

196
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:21,434
And you're very well-behaved.

197
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:29,176
There's no reason
for you to leave us.

198
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:42,247
- Oh no.
- What is it?

199
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:44,456
I just got my period.

200
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,530
I don't mind.

201
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:19,222
Good morning.
Your guests have arrived.

202
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:25,133
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>you'll see me completely naked.</i>

203
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,898
<i>Are you happy?</i>

204
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,902
<i>Yes...</i>

205
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:33,537
<i>but the man</i>
<i>should undress first.</i>

206
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:37,145
<i>No, let me undress you first.</i>

207
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,555
Your skin's so youthful.

208
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:55,258
It’s practically glowing.

209
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,124
You're utterly radiant.

210
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:04,273
Skin like this could suck
the blood right out of a man.

211
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,376
You can't be serious.

212
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,512
You're the one
who devours women.

213
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:15,514
I’m old. I want your youth
to rub off on me.

214
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:30,258
Your skin's so soft.

215
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,596
I feel like sucking on it.

216
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,436
Silly.

217
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,433
I’ve brought your sake, sir.

218
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:45,641
Master, didn't you say
you'd stopped drinking out?

219
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,510
This isn't out.

220
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,553
This is our home -
yours and mine.

221
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:56,648
I’m so happy
to hear you say that.

222
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:02,155
<i>How auspicious</i>

223
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:06,334
<i>How auspicious</i>

224
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,736
<i>Young pine</i>

225
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:17,703
<i>Show us tonight</i>

226
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,913
Congratulations!

227
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:30,624
<i>How your branches flourish</i>

228
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:36,958
<i>And your leaves grow thick</i>

229
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:42,503
<i>How auspicious</i>

230
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:49,508
<i>Your leaves grow thick</i>

231
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:53,714
What do i do with this?

232
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,216
Don't you know?

233
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:59,913
I never had
a proper wedding before.

234
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,584
If my bride had already
been properly wed,

235
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,922
that would be quite a letdown.

236
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:11,860
Indeed, tonight is our wedding.

237
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,902
So please rejoice with us,
all of you.

238
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:24,503
<i>Keep playing</i>

239
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:27,149
<i>Let the music play</i>

240
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:34,018
After the nuptial cups
comes the bridal bed.

241
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,523
Yes, they must consummate
their marriage.

242
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:38,718
It’s already been consummated.

243
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,829
That was underhanded!

244
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:44,433
You may have had her before,
but on your wedding night,

245
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,330
she'll be especially delicious.

246
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:47,993
Is that right?

247
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,400
Really?

248
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:57,470
Shall we?

249
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:00,507
Yes, Master.

250
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:02,811
Stop calling me ‘‘master.''

251
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:05,477
Call me Kichi-san from now on.

252
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:10,593
Of course... Kichi-san.

253
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,029
Sada.

254
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:23,769
<i>Have the plums blossomed</i>

255
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:28,543
What's this?
You're trembling.

256
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:31,544
What's the matter?

257
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:37,114
I don't know.
I’m shaking all over.

258
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:43,250
If you'll excuse us...

259
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:05,277
You seem awfully interested.

260
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:08,713
Come take a closer look.

261
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,978
No, let me go!

262
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:14,487
Come now.
Surely you've seen it before.

263
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:17,092
No, don't close your eyes.

264
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,852
Look!

265
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,326
Don't moan
with pleasure like that!

266
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:32,702
It’s not pleasure.
It’s pain.

267
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,810
Kosome, It’s your turn.

268
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,609
It hurts!

269
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:25,227
<i>In Kitahama</i>

270
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:34,532
<i>He came out</i>

271
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:41,701
<i>Into the cool of the evening</i>

272
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:51,912
<i>A breeze from the river</i>

273
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:56,181
<i>Suddenly blew</i>

274
00:29:56,459 --> 00:30:01,795
<i>Through the peonies</i>

275
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:10,503
<i>He's a wild</i>

276
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,005
<i>And untamed lover</i>

277
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:22,545
<i>Stay with us</i>

278
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:27,755
<i>Always</i>

279
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:32,992
<i>Kichi-san, where are you going</i>

280
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,891
<i>To harvest the rice</i>
<i>in the fields</i>

281
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:44,266
<i>Take me with you</i>

282
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:49,942
<i>You'll only get in my way</i>

283
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:59,121
<i>You wretched little monk!</i>

284
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,750
<i>May I make the bed now?</i>

285
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,726
Give us a little longer.

286
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:11,330
What time is it?

287
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,298
It’s already noon.

288
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:14,833
Really?

289
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:19,408
Kichi-san.

290
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:25,511
Kichi-san, It’s noon already.

291
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,112
Good morning.

292
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:42,221
Did you hold it all night?

293
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,533
Yes.

294
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:47,795
Couldn't you sleep?

295
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:50,831
I wasn't sleepy.

296
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:53,102
I was too happy.

297
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:54,743
Really?

298
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:56,710
You're so young.

299
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,872
How can you look
so fresh and lovely without sleep?

300
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,040
You're radiant!

301
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:08,288
I’m glad you're raring to go,
but give me a minute, okay?

302
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:11,393
- Where are you going?
- To pee.

303
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:13,927
Why not do it here?

304
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:16,096
Where?

305
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:19,702
Inside me.

306
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,127
You're crazy.

307
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:25,001
I can't do both
at the same time.

308
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:27,575
Let's try and see.

309
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:32,344
Can't you just wait
while i pee?

310
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:36,513
I’ve been waiting so long.

311
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:41,187
I see. Very well.

312
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:57,636
Are you ever not wet?

313
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:00,234
It’s not like
I’m sick or something.

314
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,807
I know.

315
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,175
You're adorable.

316
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,147
I was a little worried once,

317
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:17,487
so i went to see a doctor.

318
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,152
He said...

319
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,966
I’m acutely sensitive.

320
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,366
Acutely sensitive?

321
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:29,499
Those are big words.

322
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:35,035
In any case, I love the fact
you're acutely sensitive.

323
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,925
Kichi-san...

324
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,834
put it in me now.

325
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,635
Not yet.

326
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,440
I said put it in.

327
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:49,415
What's so funny?

328
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:53,578
I was thinking
that the only time

329
00:34:53,756 --> 00:34:58,523
my dick can rest
is when i take a piss.

330
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:01,162
That's right.

331
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:17,412
But after you're done,

332
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,310
you sure get hard again fast.

333
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:35,054
See?

334
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:37,926
Just like i said.

335
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:44,335
You're right.
It practically belongs to you.

336
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:46,404
It does belong to me.

337
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:49,536
Tell me...

338
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:55,714
why does it get hard
so quickly?

339
00:35:58,388 --> 00:35:59,912
Because...

340
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,687
it knows you want it.

341
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:11,032
I want it again now.

342
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,274
People can see us.

343
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,376
I don't care.

344
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:34,319
You sure are full of spunk,
granny.

345
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,225
I am with you two around!

346
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,804
Let's say good-bye here.

347
00:36:54,343 --> 00:36:56,811
No. I’ll walk you home.

348
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:02,778
Leave it alone.
It hurts when i walk.

349
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,607
What if the servants see us?

350
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:35,217
It’s hard again.

351
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:39,052
That's because you're holding it.
Let go.

352
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:43,352
No, you have to take me
right here and now.

353
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:56,234
Pardon me,
but I’ve brought your sake.

354
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,139
<i>Come in.</i>

355
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:04,841
How unusual!
You're not in bed together.

356
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:12,514
I can't get my young girls
to come in here.

357
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,255
Why's that?

358
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:19,225
You're always
in the middle of -

359
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:20,960
Of what?

360
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:25,327
Of me sucking your pee-pee.

361
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:39,639
Ma'am, i have
to leave for a while,

362
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:42,080
but I’ll be back
tomorrow evening.

363
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:47,789
Please keep an eye on him
so he doesn't go out.

364
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:50,053
You can count on me.

365
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:53,457
But what about geisha
coming here?

366
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,925
That's fine.

367
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,259
Really? Why?

368
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,078
Well? Do I look pretty?

369
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,917
You've lost weight.
Makes you even lovelier.

370
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,484
Oh, dear!

371
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:36,201
Kichi-san, you're still not tired?

372
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,010
It’s cruel to tempt
a woman my age with such a sight.

373
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:55,323
I know we need the money,

374
00:39:55,491 --> 00:40:00,121
but i get mad with jealousy
when I imagine you with another man.

375
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:05,793
Are you really jealous?
That makes me happy.

376
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:11,205
But he's just a school principal
and town alderman.

377
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:14,400
Very upstanding.

378
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:17,972
You like 'em upstanding,
don't you?

379
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,809
I really do.

380
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:57,577
Kichi-san, I’m taking
your kimono with me.

381
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,117
Why?

382
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:04,353
To make sure
you don't go home.

383
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:09,356
Am i supposed
to go around naked?

384
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,764
I’ll lend you my robe.

385
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:19,038
Try it on.

386
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:20,765
All right.

387
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,604
Well?

388
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,893
More sake, sir?

389
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,101
Shall i pour more, sir?

390
00:42:27,143 --> 00:42:30,670
It isn't healthy
to eat so little.

391
00:42:30,846 --> 00:42:33,576
The two of you never eat.

392
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:40,888
Sir, why don't you run away
before she gets back?

393
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:45,550
If you stay,
she'll end up killing you.

394
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:48,690
What are you doing?

395
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:19,787
Master, do you mind
hurrying it up?

396
00:43:19,962 --> 00:43:23,295
It’s hard for me
in the afternoon.

397
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:25,661
I said we didn't have
to do this.

398
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:28,599
But i want to.

399
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:31,869
I was up all night
waiting for this.

400
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:34,703
I see you have yet
to mend your ways.

401
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:39,246
You promised to try
to sleep alone.

402
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:42,080
It’s different with you,

403
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:47,388
because i like
and respect you.

404
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,749
You understand, don't you?

405
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:58,860
Sir, beat me!

406
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:01,462
Slap me!

407
00:44:01,637 --> 00:44:03,070
- Sada!
- Slap me!

408
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:06,740
Harder!

409
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,907
Harder!

410
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,012
Now pinch me!

411
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:18,209
Don't stop!

412
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,583
Harder!

413
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:24,625
Now pull my hair!

414
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:30,261
Harder!

415
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,996
Harder!

416
00:44:35,404 --> 00:44:37,133
More!

417
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:41,367
Harder!

418
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,100
But Sada...

419
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:29,083
Kichi-san!

420
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,923
How have you been?

421
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:39,529
- I’ve got money.
- Really?

422
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:41,567
Let's go spend it.

423
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:54,707
I missed you so much.

424
00:45:56,952 --> 00:46:00,115
I’ll never leave
your side again.

425
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:09,830
Kichi-san,
can I put it in me again?

426
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:11,989
If you want.

427
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:16,467
You're so restless -
putting it in, taking it out.

428
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:23,170
That's good.

429
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:25,574
Just like that.

430
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:27,815
Really?

431
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:35,920
You look so happy,

432
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:38,793
like a 16-year-old girl.

433
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:46,732
Watching your thing
go in and out of me

434
00:46:47,236 --> 00:46:49,761
makes me feel so good.

435
00:46:55,611 --> 00:46:57,272
It feels so good.

436
00:46:59,548 --> 00:47:01,140
It feels so good.

437
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,854
It feels so good.

438
00:47:43,892 --> 00:47:46,053
I feel like I’m drunk.

439
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:50,928
Kichi-san...

440
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:53,999
stay just like that.

441
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:04,878
Sada...

442
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:08,607
how was it
with your school principal?

443
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:14,113
Show me exactly
what you did.

444
00:48:19,094 --> 00:48:20,721
That tickles.

445
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:24,361
Well, that's what i did.

446
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,558
To your principal?

447
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:37,640
‘‘Sada, I just want you to think
seriously about your future.''

448
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:49,755
What about in this department?

449
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,820
That?

450
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:54,562
He couldn't get hard at all.

451
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:56,888
So what did you do?

452
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,164
Don't get mad.

453
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:05,836
I suddenly thought of you
and went into hysterics.

454
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:10,306
I don't know why...

455
00:49:11,113 --> 00:49:15,379
but i asked him to slap me.

456
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:19,118
And what did
your principal do?

457
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:28,559
Slap me.

458
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,497
I’m sorry.

459
00:49:34,002 --> 00:49:35,492
Harder.

460
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:40,106
Harder.

461
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,134
Harder!

462
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,141
Harder!

463
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:56,014
Harder!

464
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:39,389
<i>Come and look</i>

465
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:44,601
<i>In the snow</i>

466
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:51,978
<i>Even the birds</i>

467
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:57,483
<i>Stay tucked in their nests</i>

468
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,999
They say true love means eating
food dipped in your lover's juices.

469
00:51:26,214 --> 00:51:28,011
It’s delicious.

470
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:36,053
Sada...

471
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:43,091
I’ll do whatever it takes
to make you happy.

472
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:55,903
That's delicious too.

473
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:59,206
And now...

474
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:03,844
let's try this.

475
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:14,322
<i>A woman's pussy</i>
<i>is her capital city</i>

476
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:19,600
<i>Guarded by the pubic hair</i>
<i>lined up all around it</i>

477
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:22,593
Kichi-san, take it out!

478
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:25,599
Take it out! Hurry!

479
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:29,210
How can i
when you're sitting like that?

480
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:31,846
How does a hen lay an egg?

481
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:33,504
Like this?

482
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,183
That's right.

483
00:52:36,351 --> 00:52:39,843
If you strain too hard, you'll crush it.
Slowly and gently.

484
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:45,692
<i>Fighting like cats and dogs...</i>

485
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:48,452
- That's it.
- That wasn't nice!

486
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:53,360
Sada, we're not alone.

487
00:52:53,535 --> 00:52:55,298
I don't care.

488
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:02,970
- What's that for?
- To cut it off.

489
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:04,976
You're crazy.

490
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,074
So you can't use it at home.

491
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,582
I already told you
i wouldn't.

492
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:14,782
Well, you might.
That's why I’ll cut it off.

493
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:17,789
Then you won't be able
to use it either.

494
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:23,329
That's why
I’ll mount you like this

495
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:26,331
and cut it off inside me.

496
00:53:27,202 --> 00:53:30,171
All right. Go ahead.

497
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,730
It feels good.

498
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:38,509
If i cut it off,
do you think you'd die?

499
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:41,014
Probably.

500
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:43,541
I don't want you to.

501
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:48,813
Don't worry. I won't.

502
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,585
I promised to stay with you
forever, didn't i?

503
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:56,128
I’ll set you up in a small inn.

504
00:53:56,298 --> 00:53:58,892
I don't want
to be your mistress.

505
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:01,831
I don't want to share you
with your wife.

506
00:54:02,404 --> 00:54:04,872
We have to be together
all the time.

507
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:09,936
Listen, Sada,
if we lived together,

508
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:12,740
I’d be reduced to a skeleton.

509
00:54:12,914 --> 00:54:16,873
So you don't want
to live together, is that it?

510
00:54:19,521 --> 00:54:23,685
Fine. I’ll live with you,
even if i become a skeleton.

511
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:29,456
You sure?
Even worn down to a skeleton?

512
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:31,599
I’m sure.

513
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:37,069
Now could you stop
threatening me with this?

514
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,729
It’s dangerous.

515
00:54:51,486 --> 00:54:54,887
Now you'll grow a beard.

516
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:05,029
Are you going to make love
to your wife again?

517
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:06,991
No.

518
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,369
Say you'll never do it again.

519
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:11,366
I’ll never do it again.

520
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:14,439
‘‘You can kill me
if i ever make love to her.''

521
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:17,635
You can kill me
if i ever make love to her.

522
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:22,716
Kichi!

523
00:55:49,244 --> 00:55:52,372
- Shall we scare her?
- All right.

524
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:56,380
I’m a ghost!

525
00:55:57,085 --> 00:55:59,485
- I’m the haunted parasol!
- I have one eye!

526
00:55:59,654 --> 00:56:01,781
And four legs!

527
00:56:06,194 --> 00:56:08,355
Why don't you
make love to her?

528
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,090
She's not my type.

529
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,311
I’m sorry,
but It’s closing time.

530
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,250
Old man,
you want to do it?

531
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:43,657
You can have me
if you let us drink some more.

532
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:49,335
Mine's only good
for peeing these days.

533
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:03,912
Kichi,
don't ever leave me!

534
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:25,405
I caught a little goblin.

535
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,873
Now It’s your turn.
Come here.

536
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:35,772
No.

537
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,646
Then I’ll come get you.

538
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:02,041
Ouch! That hurts!

539
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:06,144
That hurts.

540
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:32,166
Could that have been
a burglar, dear?

541
00:58:32,907 --> 00:58:34,272
Don't be silly.

542
00:58:34,442 --> 00:58:36,774
A burglar wouldn't make
all that noise.

543
00:58:38,213 --> 00:58:40,647
Probably just some drunk.

544
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:43,749
We can clean it up tomorrow.

545
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,892
Do you think...

546
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:54,261
it could have been her?

547
00:58:57,565 --> 00:58:59,362
Go to sleep.

548
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:20,777
Going back to her?

549
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:27,621
You startled me,
appearing out of nowhere like that.

550
00:59:34,469 --> 00:59:36,733
It’s all right.

551
00:59:43,378 --> 00:59:50,910
<i>Come and look</i>

552
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,317
<i>In this snow</i>

553
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:01,526
<i>Even the birds</i>

554
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:07,596
<i>Stay tucked in their nests</i>

555
01:00:13,074 --> 01:00:16,407
<i>Lying in bed</i>

556
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:24,447
<i>I open the lattice window</i>

557
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:31,586
<i>With my pipe</i>

558
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:49,069
<i>Come and look</i>

559
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,828
Master, you're wanted
on the phone.

560
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,291
No!

561
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:11,989
Get off me!

562
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:28,846
Hello!

563
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:31,418
Welcome.

564
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:35,413
Damn you!

565
01:01:39,627 --> 01:01:41,254
Damn you, Kichi!

566
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:45,424
Tell me the truth!
You fucked her, didn't you?

567
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,367
If you want a reverse grip,
you'll need a thicker blade.

568
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:52,802
You can't kill anyone like that.

569
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:55,704
I meant to buy
a thicker blade.

570
01:01:55,877 --> 01:01:59,040
Then how'd you end up
with a carving knife?

571
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,914
There were people watching.

572
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:05,912
You're crazy!

573
01:02:06,387 --> 01:02:09,288
How would anyone guess
what you wanted it for?

574
01:02:09,457 --> 01:02:12,984
This is all
you ever think about.

575
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:15,061
Son of a bitch!

576
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,996
You think I’m crazy because
i can't stop thinking about you?

577
01:02:20,868 --> 01:02:23,200
Take off your clothes!

578
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:25,699
Wearing a kimono like this!

579
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:28,004
Take it off or -

580
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:30,007
Wait a minute.

581
01:02:30,178 --> 01:02:32,942
I can't take it off like this.

582
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:36,379
Help me, will you?

583
01:02:44,626 --> 01:02:45,991
Tell me:

584
01:02:48,463 --> 01:02:50,954
What did you do
in bed with your wife?

585
01:02:54,202 --> 01:02:57,535
Look, he's shaking his head:
‘‘I didn't do anything.''

586
01:02:57,705 --> 01:02:58,797
Apologize.

587
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:02,875
‘‘I have no reason
to apologize.''

588
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:05,612
See?
- Bastard.

589
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,011
He's a stubborn one.
I’ll teach him a lesson.

590
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:10,916
Please do.

591
01:03:11,085 --> 01:03:13,144
Give him a good punishing.

592
01:03:49,424 --> 01:03:50,891
Ouch!

593
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:53,886
- Does that hurt?
- It sure does.

594
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:58,794
- What about that?
- Yes.

595
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,632
Does it hurt
but feel good too?

596
01:04:02,036 --> 01:04:03,833
It hurts
but feels good too.

597
01:04:04,005 --> 01:04:05,996
Say, ‘‘Bite me harder.''

598
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:07,801
Bite me harder.

599
01:04:09,677 --> 01:04:12,612
- Does this feel good too?
- Yes.

600
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:19,281
Fuck me harder!

601
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:31,259
You like this?

602
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,466
Yes.

603
01:04:34,535 --> 01:04:38,198
I’ll do whatever you want.

604
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,400
Forgive me for leaving you alone
these past three days.

605
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:46,311
I thought I’d go mad!

606
01:04:46,481 --> 01:04:48,073
I’m sorry.

607
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:57,683
Are you crying?

608
01:04:58,226 --> 01:04:59,716
Only because I’m happy.

609
01:04:59,894 --> 01:05:01,259
Look at me.

610
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:04,592
I’ve never seen you cry before.
Let me see.

611
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:07,030
- No!
- It’s all right.

612
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,298
Your tears are salty.

613
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,541
Damn you for making me
so happy.

614
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:18,504
You're awful!

615
01:05:24,218 --> 01:05:27,153
- May i bring in your sake?
<i>- Yes.</i>

616
01:05:31,325 --> 01:05:35,853
Bring it over here.
We're fused together.

617
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,591
- Don't you want anything to eat?
- No.

618
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:45,095
A full stomach
makes you sleepy.

619
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,775
Shall i clean up
the room a bit?

620
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:52,212
There's a strange smell.

621
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,780
We like that smell...

622
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:56,741
don't we?

623
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:09,890
Kichi,
don't fall asleep on me.

624
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,399
I’ve heard it feels good
to choke each other

625
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:19,540
when you're making love.

626
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,809
When you clutched
my throat the other day,

627
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,071
it felt really good.

628
01:06:28,249 --> 01:06:29,876
Really?

629
01:06:30,785 --> 01:06:33,447
Okay, then choke me.

630
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:35,088
All right.

631
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:43,357
Here goes.

632
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:48,833
As you tighten up here,
you'll tighten down there too.

633
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:53,668
Am i hurting you?
- I’m fine.

634
01:06:54,842 --> 01:06:56,742
Squeeze tighter.

635
01:06:57,979 --> 01:07:00,038
How's that?

636
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,759
What's wrong?

637
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:16,828
Your face is beet-red.

638
01:07:17,265 --> 01:07:19,165
It’s nothing.

639
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,527
Squeeze harder.

640
01:07:21,702 --> 01:07:24,796
You sure?
It’s gonna hurt.

641
01:07:24,972 --> 01:07:27,099
Don't get mad, okay?

642
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:38,847
How's it feel?

643
01:07:42,189 --> 01:07:43,486
Good?

644
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:51,761
I guess you have to approach death
to feel the height of ecstasy.

645
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:56,464
Did you enjoy it?
- Not at all.

646
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:59,600
You have to squeeze hard.

647
01:08:00,474 --> 01:08:04,911
I’ve had enough.
I don't like watching you suffer.

648
01:08:05,179 --> 01:08:08,580
Then let me try it on you.

649
01:08:16,324 --> 01:08:18,292
Shall i?

650
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:22,685
Go ahead.

651
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:29,564
You're tickling me.

652
01:08:29,737 --> 01:08:31,227
You scared?

653
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:33,963
Not at all.
Go ahead.

654
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:43,577
Your thing
just jerked inside me.

655
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:53,725
It keeps on twitching.

656
01:08:56,364 --> 01:08:58,332
I can't breathe.

657
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,858
Go slow, okay?

658
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:06,973
All right.

659
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,880
It feels so good.

660
01:09:23,224 --> 01:09:26,421
I can't stand it.
- Does it feel good?

661
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:33,991
- I feel it twitching.
- Feel good?

662
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:38,838
Yes.

663
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,182
I can't stand it...

664
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,930
It’s moving around.

665
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,908
I can't breathe.

666
01:10:32,493 --> 01:10:35,621
- The geisha won't come in here.
- Why?

667
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:37,661
Because of your reputation.

668
01:10:37,832 --> 01:10:41,165
What? What are they
saying about us?

669
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:43,803
- That you're perverts.
- What?

670
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,570
Who cares
what they say, Sada?

671
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:51,903
I care.
Why are we perverts?

672
01:10:52,179 --> 01:10:55,637
You're constantly
sucking on his thing.

673
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:58,284
What's perverted about that?

674
01:10:58,452 --> 01:11:02,513
Why shouldn't a woman
adore her lover's body?

675
01:11:03,057 --> 01:11:05,651
Come back here!
- Let her be.

676
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:08,624
- Who's talking about us?
- Everyone.

677
01:11:08,796 --> 01:11:12,254
Everyone?
You mean you, don't you?

678
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:17,170
What do you think about us?
Tell me, damn it!

679
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:26,142
Sada, stop it!

680
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:31,709
That's enough now.

681
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:33,854
Leave the poor girl alone.

682
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:39,126
Look, Sada...

683
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,719
who cares if people
call us perverts?

684
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:46,899
I want you to fuck her.

685
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:49,968
Master, please don't.
I’ll never be able to marry.

686
01:11:52,773 --> 01:11:54,263
Get out.

687
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:57,001
He's too good for you anyway.

688
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:02,479
Good evening.
My name is Kikuryo.

689
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,312
- Your geisha has arrived.
- Thank you.

690
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:13,857
My, you certainly
are a virile gentleman!

691
01:12:14,395 --> 01:12:15,987
What shall i play?

692
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:19,496
Anything.
Just play with spirit.

693
01:12:22,837 --> 01:12:28,833
<i>You treat me</i>

694
01:12:29,743 --> 01:12:38,014
<i>So hatefully</i>

695
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:44,480
<i>Yet i cannot help</i>
<i>loving you</i>

696
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:48,718
Do i seem like
a pervert to you?

697
01:12:48,896 --> 01:12:50,523
Why do you ask?

698
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:55,465
I can't get enough
of his body.

699
01:12:55,636 --> 01:12:59,504
That's natural for a woman.

700
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:01,798
How old are you?

701
01:13:01,976 --> 01:13:04,740
I’m 68.

702
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:09,512
Do you find him attractive?

703
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:13,050
Oh yes, he's very charming.

704
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,383
So you don't mind
watching us do this?

705
01:13:16,757 --> 01:13:19,351
It’s a feast for the eyes.

706
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,623
Would you...

707
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,326
like him to make love to you?

708
01:13:44,485 --> 01:13:47,818
Ma'am, it feels so young.

709
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:33,987
What's that?

710
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:42,089
Granny pissed herself.

711
01:16:42,262 --> 01:16:44,162
What a mess.

712
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:46,993
I hope she's not dead.

713
01:16:49,002 --> 01:16:51,334
You look all pale...

714
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:54,065
like a corpse.

715
01:16:54,441 --> 01:16:56,773
Don't say that.
It could bring bad luck.

716
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:58,673
It was awful.

717
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:02,077
I felt like i was having sex
with my dead mother.

718
01:17:02,883 --> 01:17:04,942
Your mother died?

719
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,452
Yes, when i was a child.
Yours?

720
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:10,453
Three years ago.

721
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:12,649
I wasn't there when she died.

722
01:17:13,393 --> 01:17:15,827
The next year,
I spent ten days

723
01:17:15,996 --> 01:17:18,829
taking care of my father
as he was dying.

724
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:21,297
Once you're dead, that's it.

725
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:30,069
- Sada.
- What?

726
01:17:32,412 --> 01:17:34,710
Let's be happy
together forever.

727
01:17:52,166 --> 01:17:56,068
Let's say good-bye here.
I must say...

728
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:59,763
you don't smell
very good today.

729
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,602
Like a dead rat
or something.

730
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:11,942
Master, could we go away
to the hot springs for a week?

731
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:13,450
Impossible!

732
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,181
If anyone knew about us,
I’d have to shoot myself.

733
01:19:27,694 --> 01:19:30,959
What's wrong?
Why are you back so soon?

734
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:33,759
Kichi, where did you go?

735
01:19:33,934 --> 01:19:37,836
You weren't here,
so they cleaned the room!

736
01:19:38,572 --> 01:19:43,202
I went for a haircut.
I didn't think you'd be back so soon.

737
01:19:43,377 --> 01:19:46,346
What? You bastard!

738
01:19:46,546 --> 01:19:49,071
How dare you go for a haircut

739
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:51,479
while I’m out
earning your keep!

740
01:19:51,652 --> 01:19:53,051
Forgive me.

741
01:19:54,554 --> 01:19:59,218
But you said you love
my neck when It’s shaved.

742
01:20:00,761 --> 01:20:04,629
I love it so much
i want to slice it open.

743
01:20:09,436 --> 01:20:11,461
Please don't.

744
01:20:12,339 --> 01:20:14,967
Strangling me should suffice.

745
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:20,369
Perhaps that's just what I’ll do.

746
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:59,209
Sada, that's dangerous.

747
01:21:05,392 --> 01:21:07,758
Want me to strangle you?

748
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:12,321
No, but if it
gives you pleasure -

749
01:21:14,735 --> 01:21:16,930
Say, ‘‘I want you to strangle me.''

750
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:19,999
I want you to strangle me.

751
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:22,597
All right.

752
01:21:27,114 --> 01:21:29,241
Don't pull too hard.

753
01:21:31,184 --> 01:21:33,152
Are you afraid?

754
01:21:33,587 --> 01:21:35,282
Yes.

755
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,651
You say that...

756
01:21:40,093 --> 01:21:42,823
but you're actually happy,
aren't you?

757
01:22:16,062 --> 01:22:17,825
I’m going to strangle you.

758
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:34,637
Pull tighter.

759
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,038
You can pull tighter.

760
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:53,850
Is it twitching?

761
01:23:55,562 --> 01:23:57,359
Really?

762
01:23:57,631 --> 01:23:59,064
Good.

763
01:23:59,232 --> 01:24:01,632
Pull as hard as you can.

764
01:24:05,705 --> 01:24:07,195
Harder.

765
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:32,129
- What's wrong?
- Wait a minute.

766
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:37,927
It was starting
to really feel good.

767
01:24:39,839 --> 01:24:44,276
I know: I’ll tie you up.
Give me your hands.

768
01:25:05,298 --> 01:25:08,597
Don't you like being choked?

769
01:25:09,336 --> 01:25:10,928
I don't mind.

770
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:15,840
If you fight it,
I’ll pull even harder.

771
01:25:16,509 --> 01:25:19,603
I said i didn't mind, didn't l?

772
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,244
My body is yours.
Do as you please with it.

773
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:28,183
Then I’ll start again.

774
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,788
Go as slow as you can.

775
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:04,744
Does it hurt?

776
01:27:11,157 --> 01:27:13,557
Does it feel good?

777
01:27:16,896 --> 01:27:21,390
Like I’m part of you.

778
01:27:22,902 --> 01:27:25,462
All i see is red.

779
01:27:27,474 --> 01:27:32,002
You're so quiet.

780
01:27:32,212 --> 01:27:33,804
It’s a little scary.

781
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:35,943
Say something.

782
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,683
You idiot!

783
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:43,255
How can i talk
when you're choking me?

784
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,726
Don't worry about me.
Just enjoy yourself.

785
01:27:51,631 --> 01:27:53,861
Even if i kill you?

786
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:02,197
All right.

787
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:05,377
I’ll kill you.

788
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,150
I’ll kill you.

789
01:28:16,890 --> 01:28:19,256
It feels so good.

790
01:28:22,495 --> 01:28:23,985
It feels so good.

791
01:28:29,969 --> 01:28:31,436
I’ll kill you.

792
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:34,963
I’ll kill you.

793
01:28:42,782 --> 01:28:44,841
I’ll kill you.

794
01:29:19,018 --> 01:29:21,452
Was it good?

795
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:22,013
If you want it that badly,

796
01:30:22,649 --> 01:30:26,141
get on top of me,
though I might not keep it up.

797
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:29,211
Are you sure?

798
01:32:58,438 --> 01:33:00,303
Does it hurt?

799
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:05,705
Watch me while i sleep.

800
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:22,528
If i fall asleep,
you'll choke me again, won't you?

801
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:27,826
You want me to choke you?

802
01:33:33,306 --> 01:33:35,274
If you strangle me...

803
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:39,735
don't stop midway.

804
01:33:40,146 --> 01:33:42,376
It’s too painful afterward.

805
01:35:30,022 --> 01:35:31,717
Kichi-san.

806
01:35:44,737 --> 01:35:46,295
I’m starting now.

807
01:36:29,248 --> 01:36:31,580
<i>Ready?</i>

808
01:36:31,751 --> 01:36:33,548
Not yet.

809
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,145
Ready?

810
01:36:36,489 --> 01:36:38,457
Not yet.

811
01:36:45,464 --> 01:36:48,399
Ready?

812
01:36:49,602 --> 01:36:51,832
Not yet.

813
01:36:52,571 --> 01:36:54,937
Ready?

814
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:57,342
Not yet.

815
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:06,108
Ready?

816
01:37:24,804 --> 01:37:27,204
Ready?

817
01:37:50,162 --> 01:37:53,495
Kichi-san!

818
01:38:03,709 --> 01:38:05,301
Kichi-san.

819
01:40:00,893 --> 01:40:04,852
SADA AND KlCHl
TOGETHER FOREVER

820
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:19,170
<i>For the next four days,</i>
<i>Sada carried</i>

821
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:22,803
<i>his severed organ</i>
<i>from one Tokyo inn to another.</i>

822
01:40:23,382 --> 01:40:27,614
<i>She was still smiling radiantly</i>
<i>when she was arrested.</i>

823
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:30,978
<i>The story shocked</i>
<i>all of Japan.</i>

824
01:40:31,156 --> 01:40:34,956
<i>The sympathy of the public</i>
<i>made her strangely popular.</i>

825
01:40:35,794 --> 01:40:39,093
<i>These events</i>
<i>took place in 1936.</i>

1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,041
Bill knows he's about to die
and there's nothing he can do,

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,922
because he's the one who taught her
the five-step technique.

3
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,371
He then wipes off his blood.

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,808
He takes his five steps.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,002
That's how he died.

6
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,530
Stop fooling around and give me a movie.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,130
This is a very good one,
give me 50.

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,605
It better not be scratched!

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,080
Why can't you find a worthwhile job?
- So I can be as busy as you guys?

10
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,851
You go on making 50 bob

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,368
while we live like fat cats.

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,204
At least I'm passionate about what I do.

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,528
We love the big bucks.

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,890
<i>The Vultures will be performing
at Gathanji Square!</i>

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,689
That's where I'll make my big bucks.

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,447
People. people!

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,329
Even a child knows
that he who smells it first, did it.

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,482
Know that the new constitution has
empowered us and we will take action.

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,409
You do understand that what's mine,
is yours, and what's yours, is mine.

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,049
How can I loot that which is mine?
- People, people!

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,728
A fool doesn't know
the extent of his foolishness.

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,809
You're right! What's yours, is ours.

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,766
But what is ours, is not yours.

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,442
People. people!

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,643
Let's go!

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,368
People...
- Excuse me!

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,166
We'll be right back after this break.

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,051
Dude, who's that?

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,490
This one?

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,686
He's the King of Sparta who killed
thousands of people with his bare hands.

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,641
Mwas, show him!
- What's that?

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,646
You want a demonstration?

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,282
This is the story of a Spartan boy.
Just like you.

34
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,402
Are you done?

35
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,125
People. people!

36
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,363
Let me tell you... - What were you
saying? Smell on his behalf or smell him?

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,811
I tried to remember it. Nothing!
I tried to get a rhythm.

38
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,164
Blundering is your expertise.
- Excuse me,

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,482
I'd like to join the Vultures.

40
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,006
"I'd like to join..."
- Let me talk to this guy.

41
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,843
How can I become an actor?
- You're good.

42
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,726
Thanks.
- But you live in a village.

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,321
I could come to Nairobi.

44
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,850
And then what?
- Can you help me?

45
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,482
Well maybe.

46
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,762
Maybe.

47
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,288
But you'll need an agent.

48
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,880
An agent?

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,441
How do I find an agent?

50
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,326
You're looking at one.
- Really?

51
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,565
Can you help me?
- Well,

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,368
of course I can. It'll cost you 5,000.

53
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,047
Don't worry, my friend, don't worry.
No need to get worked up.

54
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,245
I understand. You're nothing but

55
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,241
a suffering artist
trying to make it big. - Big, yes!

56
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,011
So give me 1,000 and I'll hook you up.

57
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,765
1,000?

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,401
500.

59
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,606
It's all I have.
- Bring the rest to the National Theatre.

60
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,084
No problem.
- When you get there, ask for Jose.

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,807
I'm always there. Cool?

62
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,606
Got it, my man.
- OK.

63
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,371
What, Mwas? 500?

64
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,882
Give you 500 of my own money?

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,405
Stop treating me like an idiot.

66
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,560
What do you take me for?
Don't you think I know what I'm doing?

67
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,048
You don't! You have no idea!

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,722
You think one day you'll be a star

69
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,085
like Bruce Willis! Who are you kidding?

70
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,723
Go to hell.
No wonder you're always broke.

71
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,210
<i>Let's drink and be merry
for a child is born.</i>

72
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,922
Now, Mwas, seriously,

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,602
look at your dad. He drinks like a fish.

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,845
Do you want to leave me alone with him?

75
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,801
You want me to feel guilty?
- History will always be a lie.

76
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,651
Look at the leaders of tomorrow!

77
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,091
Look at the leaders of tomorrow!
What bullshit!

78
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,528
Why have you come
to my home without my permission?

79
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,451
Are these the bars
you put up to keep me out?

80
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,282
You have decided I can't think?

81
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,010
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

82
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,969
Why are you always in other folks' homes?
Don't you have husbands to cook for?

83
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,562
Is this alcohol or a curse?
- What are you asking?

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,006
Is it your booze
or did you buy some and I poured it?

85
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,401
I'd better go.

86
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,282
What?

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,521
Mwas! I'm talking to you. Come here!

88
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,609
Stop staring at me
like those movies you sell.

89
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,881
What is it?

90
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,286
I'm going to Nairobi.

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,040
Really?

92
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,407
That's fine, but know this:
be wary of alcohol

93
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,206
and women.

94
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,167
Nairobi has the worst people.

95
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,405
You see, the better you become,

96
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,331
the harder they try to stop you.

97
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,360
In Nairobi you can't be good and make it.

98
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,168
Let me tell you, Nairobi is not a city
for brilliance. - Is there a good place?

99
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,803
Nowhere! The whole society is as rotten

100
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,203
as Babylon!

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,370
Why don't you go to sleep
and leave the children in peace?

102
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,931
Since when do you tell me
when to go to sleep?

103
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,851
Mwas, the last time you were in Nairobi
you were a small boy.

104
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,400
That place is where poverty,
disease and the devil live.

105
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,046
Do you know that?

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,201
Here.

107
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,451
Go. And remember your mother's words.

108
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,210
1,000? Not unless I'm marrying you!

109
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,682
Sit down.

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,448
So you have decided to work like a man?

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,968
If you're going to Nairobi,

112
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,121
there's a package
I want you to take somewhere.

113
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,761
OK?

114
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,325
There's an Indian shop on River Road
called Khanji Electronics, got that?

115
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,202
OK?

116
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,090
Mwangi, where are you going
with so much luggage?

117
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,564
Nairobi.
- Have a safe journey, Mwangi.

118
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,089
Easy, man, let go of the bag.

119
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,841
Easy, easy. What happened?

120
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,244
God!
- Go look for these people.

121
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,161
God!

122
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,361
Come here!
- No!

123
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,969
It wasn't me!
- You don't think I work here?

124
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,204
Don't hit me! I'm sorry!
- Let's go!

125
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,486
Name?

126
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,967
Sir, there's a mistake. I'm innocent.

127
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,689
Answer the question!
- Let me tell you what happened.

128
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,168
Name?
- George Mwangi.

129
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,971
I haven't done anything.
In fact I'm the one who got robbed.

130
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,522
Young man, I didn't bring you here.

131
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,764
So give me your phone and your wallet.

132
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,965
I have nothing left!
Didn't I just tell you I got robbed?

133
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,164
Rono, lock this one up!

134
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,681
Honestly, sir, I'm not lying to you.
I only got here this morning and then

135
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,929
We're not here to work for one person.

136
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,962
I'm not lying. I got here this morning!
- They all want to be attended to!

137
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,603
Quiet! Belt.
- I don't know what's happening

138
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,082
Let's go.

139
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,885
In here.

140
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,644
Come here. Where's the knife?
- I don't have one! - Where is it?

141
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,048
I saw you with it!
You've hidden it up your arse!

142
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,087
Where's the knife?

143
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,891
Where is it?

144
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,408
Get out of here, bitch!

145
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,003
He doesn't even have money

146
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,410
What?
- Nothing. - Faggot!

147
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,682
Can someone clean this toilet?

148
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,281
Shit!

149
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,449
Which one do you want?

150
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,770
Dude,
haven't you started from the gutter?

151
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,729
Don't worry,
tomorrow morning you'll be released.

152
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,329
But when you get out,

153
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,649
you need to know that for survival
in Nairobi you have to be smart.

154
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,929
Where do I start?

155
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,483
Go downtown to Kirinyaga Road.

156
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,561
Near Nyayo Market
there's a neighbourhood called Gaza.

157
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,125
Ask for Dingo.
Tell him I sent you. Cool?

158
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,287
Cool.

159
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,769
When will you get out?

160
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,922
We always get out.

161
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,644
Here I am!

162
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,002
I see you.

163
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,524
When are the auditions?
- There are no auditions.

164
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,642
What?

165
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,440
You have to sort yourself out.

166
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,924
What? You played me!

167
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,563
Take it easy, my man.
Nairobi is like that.

168
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,806
My God!

169
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,810
Excuse me, we're rehearsing.

170
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,607
Can I get an audition?
- You should check the notice board.

171
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,922
What dungeon are you from?

172
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,681
All you Kikuyus

173
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,050
are thieves!
- Sorry. - Sorry?

174
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,167
Sorry won't bring back my stereos.
- How much? I'll get it for you.

175
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,604
You're as stupid as that daddy of yours!
The 20,000 will come from your arse!

176
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,888
20,000?
- Minimum!

177
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,449
I promise I will find the money.
Don't tell Daddy M. - Idiot!

178
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,450
Motherfucker! Out!

179
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,321
Please don't tell him!
- Out! - Please!

180
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,050
Where's Dingo's place?
- Dingo is in there.

181
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,125
I'm not lying! Ask him, you lazy bums!

182
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,044
I'm looking for Dingo.

183
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,804
And who are you?

184
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,402
My name is Mwas. Oti sent me.

185
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,445
He told me to ask for Dingo.
- Which Oti?

186
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,202
Oti and I were in Central.

187
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,769
Talk to me.

188
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,201
I need a life.

189
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,569
We don't sell lives here.

190
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,802
Could you hook me up with a job?

191
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,124
What do you think this is?
The labour office?

192
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,927
Not really. I'm just looking for
something to keep me going for a while.

193
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,848
Dude, take him to work for Mama.

194
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,406
Thanks!

195
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,246
Mama Akinyi,

196
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,201
give this guy a job.
- OK.

197
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,883
Here are the dishes,
soap and everything you need.

198
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,246
And hurry up, OK?

199
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,964
Hurry up!
- OK.

200
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,602
The customer wants water.
Bring it to him. - OK.

201
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,566
The two teas
are for that table at the end.

202
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,329
Make sure you finish all of them.

203
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,363
Ah, Oti!

204
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,324
Give me five, my man!

205
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,883
What are you doing?
I told you to talk to Dingo!

206
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,767
Yeah, and he got me this job.

207
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,931
This is like dumpster diving. Let's go.

208
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,328
What about the work?

209
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,002
We live for the day.

210
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,486
Where do you make money here?
- Everywhere, but you have to be smart.

211
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,411
In Gaza
the main moneymaker is spare parts.

212
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,369
But there's also cocaine,
booze and pussy.

213
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,928
Whatever makes you happy.

214
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,089
Hey, what's up?
- I'm good.

215
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,845
One of the people who move our stuff.

216
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,890
Merchandise?
- Yeah.

217
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,727
Gaza has owners. Gaza is ours.

218
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,204
I have my own gang.

219
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,168
I'll tell you what,
let's go this way. Cool?

220
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,888
See this place?

221
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,720
This is one of the places
where we sell our stuff.

222
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,960
Where are we going?

223
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,763
It's been a long time
since I saw my woman.

224
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,762
Go away! What kind of man are you?
You can't even pay for a blowjob!

225
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,360
What? Come where?

226
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,049
The way your game is down
with your tiny snake dick?

227
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,686
You and your small dick can go
and get fucked elsewhere. Useless git!

228
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,202
Oti!

229
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,289
Hi. You're out?

230
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,204
Am I not a citizen?

231
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,002
Who's this idiot?
- My friend.

232
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,169
Dude, get busy!

233
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,963
What do you want me to say?
- I've missed you. - I've missed you!

234
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,404
Chill
- Stop that!

235
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,286
Chill. Don't be scared.

236
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,927
What is it? - I don't have money.
- Money is not the issue.

237
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,205
Touching is free.
But if you come, you pay. Cool?

238
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,607
Take it easy. I'm hot 24/7.
- I don't have money. Stop it.

239
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,721
What's her name?

240
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,206
Amina.

241
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,761
Amina?

242
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,204
She's hot!

243
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,050
So where do you live?

244
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,084
We'll go there later.

245
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,807
Hey, Oti! What's up, boss?

246
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,891
How's it kicking, Waf?
- The cops can't hold you.

247
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,088
Hey, Oti, who's this?

248
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,247
My pal Mwas. This is my gang.

249
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,528
I saw you guys working earlier.

250
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,044
There's a lot of work.

251
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,961
By the way, Oti,
there's a job in Ngara. What do you say?

252
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,163
A well paying job or not?

253
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,009
What? Ngara? That's where the cops shot
the hardcore criminals. Look at him!

254
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,406
That's stupid. Do you want to die poor?

255
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,922
We have to live large.
We have to live it up!

256
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,726
Oti's right.

257
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,286
That's the way it is, guys.

258
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,605
Mose, are you buying or am I?
- I'm buying, you order.

259
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,567
Mum, Nr 65 and the soup of the day.
- Same here.

260
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,682
<i>Move aside, mistress.</i>

261
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,083
<i>All you bring is distress.</i>

262
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,205
What are you writing?
- Lyrics.

263
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,721
Are you an artist?

264
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,206
Mose wants to be a star like Kidum.

265
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,481
This is Nairobi. You can't
make it here without connections.

266
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,571
But you can, if you know a few cops.

267
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,161
What are you talking about?

268
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,126
Do you want to get shot by
the side of the road like that Meru guy?

269
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,005
What did he do?

270
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,769
He was an informer.

271
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,727
He ratted on some guy from Majengo.

272
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,560
When the guy got out,

273
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,924
the informer was gunned down.
- God!

274
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,366
Oti's asleep.

275
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,888
I want to sleep, too.

276
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,650
How many people have you robbed
to afford those clothes?

277
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,727
Not as many as you've fucked.

278
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,730
I know what you're thinking.

279
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,767
What?

280
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,760
Why do I do it?

281
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,169
Because the pay's good.

282
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,205
How much?

283
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,049
500 a day.

284
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,246
I didn't mean that.
How much do you charge?

285
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,601
That depends.
Between 50 and 5,000.

286
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,726
So I can have you for 50?

287
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,202
Never!

288
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,685
So can I ask you what your plans are?

289
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,890
I want to go to school,
become a beautician

290
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,889
and open up my own salon.
- Sounds good.

291
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,689
What about your parents?

292
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,922
My mum has disowned me.

293
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,242
If my dad knew what I was doing,
I'd be dead.

294
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,208
Welcome to the home of rejects!

295
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,802
I have an appointment.

296
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,483
Dude, push the cart. Come on!

297
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,371
What? Me?

298
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,924
We'll walk up front. If the shit
hits the fan, we meet at the base.

299
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,804
How are you, officers?
- Young man,

300
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,242
what are you singing?
- It's God's

301
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,728
Where are you taking all this weed?

302
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,050
Officer, I'm saved.

303
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,641
So if we spray you with bullets,
we'll miss you?

304
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,203
But the choir of angels
will sing for me.

305
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,408
What's this guy talking about?
- I wonder...

306
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,524
Leave him alone. He's mad.

307
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,561
Guys! Man!

308
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,009
B15's again? I told you,
no one is buying these things!

309
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,608
Has the government
given you a tender, or something?

310
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,450
Give us 5,000.

311
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,280
Maybe I'll give you 500, end of story.
- What good is 500?

312
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,290
I'd rather throw the stuff away.

313
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,244
3,000. Final offer.

314
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,282
Oti...

315
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,847
Here, maybe I'll give you 2,000.

316
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,320
Just this once.
- Listen, my man,

317
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,364
I want you to get Corolla parts for me.

318
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,324
Head lights

319
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,967
and side mirrors, OK?

320
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,211
Stop looking so miserable all the time.
- Fuck off!

321
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,726
Oti? See you later.
- Smart!

322
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,484
We could've made more in that deal.
- Fine. Next time you negotiate.

323
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,366
I can read body language.

324
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,482
You!

325
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,522
Stop, thief!

326
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,886
Stop, thief!

327
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,724
Give me back my phone.

328
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,042
Shit.

329
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,044
Where does she think she is?

330
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,568
Shit, shit, fuck!

331
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,602
Cops!

332
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,404
What?
- Those are the idiots who arrested me.

333
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,364
I thought you were untouchable?

334
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,610
I am, but these guys
are new in the area.

335
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,284
What do you mean?

336
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,086
They want to split 50-50 on what we make.
- And if we don't?

337
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,650
What if we don't give it to them?

338
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,680
What's up?

339
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,766
I'm on my way.

340
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,367
Let's go.

341
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,808
What's up?
- Found the Corollas. One is here,

342
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,730
the other one's over there.

343
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,206
What about the watchman?
- Looks like he's about to take a break.

344
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,042
There he goes.

345
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,641
He's going, guys.

346
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,041
He's gone.
- For now. - Be quick!

347
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,203
Dude, you broke it.
Let's see you sell that to Waya!

348
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,690
It's easy. You hit it
on this side, see? Like this.

349
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,409
And out it pops.
Go on, hit it. Hit it hard!

350
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,683
Hey, what are you doing?

351
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,049
Thief!
- Thief!

352
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,042
What?

353
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,851
"Thief, thief!"

354
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,603
He was scared out of his mind.

355
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,481
He was so scared he was rooted to
the spot, like a car at traffic lights.

356
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,168
The mob wanted to beat him up.

357
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,683
Trouble was brewing

358
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,201
Big trouble!

359
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,682
Today is Tuesday, or have you forgotten?
- Officer, we need to talk.

360
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,611
Look, we're broke.
We haven't had a job in ages.

361
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,162
So I'm asking you: could you come back
next week? That'd be great.

362
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,000
And what am I going to eat?
- Look, you know

363
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,089
how this business works.
- What are you looking at?

364
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,729
Give me your ID.
- He's cool. He's one of my guys.

365
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,450
You guys need to work hard.
- No problem.

366
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,324
He's my guy.

367
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,689
How much did they swindle?
- 1,000.

368
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,771
So we have 1,000 left
and merchandise worth 2,000.

369
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,122
No, this stuff 's worth 8,000.

370
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,446
That's empty talk.
- Let me show you how it's done.

371
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,327
The joy of work is not money,
but blowing the money.

372
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,526
Live today, and tomorrow will
take care of itself. - What do you do,

373
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,010
if you're not out making money?
- This guy doesn't know anything.

374
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,124
Today we need to get laid.

375
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,688
Are these from China?
- China, my arse!

376
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,006
Do you think we're stupid?
- 4,000, maybe.

377
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,169
Waya, don't mess with me!

378
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,081
Give us 10,000,
so each of us can go home with 2,000.

379
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,329
What, am I your provider now?

380
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,081
OK 5,000.

381
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,766
Don't, Oti!

382
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,002
5,000 can't even buy us all
a whore on River Road.

383
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,247
What's this?
- He's my guy. Let him talk.

384
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,651
Dude, here's the situation...

385
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,567
Have you lost your mind?
- Listen, crazy man,

386
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,129
I'll give you 5,000

387
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,891
and 500 more, OK?

388
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,287
8,000.

389
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,729
Don't be stupid. 5,500.

390
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,281
Hey, stop being so pigheaded!
Where are you going with my stuff?

391
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,281
6,000.

392
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,562
8,000.

393
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,250
6,500. My final offer. Am I going to pay
for your whores and condoms, too?

394
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,086
Add 500 for fuel.

395
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,126
You're a fool.
Now get your arse over here.

396
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,124
Now go fuck yourself. Faggot.

397
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,290
No problem.

398
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,482
Dude!

399
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,446
Idiots!

400
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,200
Well done, dude!

401
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,763
You're my guy!

402
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,728
Didn't I tell you I know how to hustle?

403
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,691
Stop it, dude!

404
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,921
Talk to me.

405
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,523
Oh... Madame!

406
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,246
Yes.

407
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,444
Tomorrow's OK.

408
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,880
Listen to this, guys!

409
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,690
Hi, guys.

410
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,248
Mojo Jojo, Ministry of Evil!

411
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,368
Hey, Mwas, are you a guy of pints?

412
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,441
Let me throw you one in Westie.

413
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:48,962
OK.

414
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,760
Right. Let's go.

415
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,089
I don't understand.

416
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,889
She's with a customer.

417
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,807
Dude, give her this.

418
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,323
Let me go distribute the rest.

419
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,682
Mwas, what do you say?

420
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,370
Why not give me 100 and I'll do you
so good, you won't be able to - No.

421
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,370
You're mean! It's only 100.

422
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,686
OK, let's make it 50 and I'll show you
styles you've never seen before.

423
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,042
Imported styles.

424
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,128
50 is fine, OK?

425
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,366
Right, 20. My last offer. I'll tell you:
you'll be back for more tomorrow!

426
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,401
Get out!

427
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,210
Get out, I'm on the job!

428
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,370
What?

429
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,529
I thought you were in trouble.

430
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,121
I know.

431
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,360
Thanks anyway.

432
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,967
Here.

433
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,650
There I was, getting of the bus,
when more than fifty gangsters

434
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,001
attacked me. They stole
everything I had, even your stereos.

435
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,048
I woke up in hospital with stitches.
- My friend

436
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,401
In hospital, with...

437
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,400
I'm sorry!

438
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,683
Sorry broke the white man's china.

439
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,801
You're lucky you're my relative
or I'd have killed you.

440
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,041
Get up.

441
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,447
Come on!

442
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,924
What car did the Luo guy want?
- He wanted a VX.

443
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,089
Who are you doing business with?
- They're my old mates.

444
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,843
Why can't they
steal the cars themselves?

445
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,841
They could,
but they want to work with us.

446
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,440
Why?

447
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,724
Because they trust me.

448
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,283
We've never carjacked anyone before.

449
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,325
That's why we've never made 100,000!

450
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,447
I have to ask Dingo.

451
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,371
My cut is 30,000.

452
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,165
No problem.

453
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,568
Talk to me. - How much to Westlands?
- 500. - Make it 300.

454
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,651
Add 50 as we go, OK?

455
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,801
What's up? Get in.

456
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,321
Bitch, don't look behind you!
- Oh, God! - Turn a corner here.

457
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,682
Guys, I believe in you.
- There's only two people in that car!

458
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,771
What did you say? How many people?
- Two!

459
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,570
Don't worry about it.
There, they're slowing down.

460
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,247
Get out!

461
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,001
Get out!
- Get out and don't look at me!

462
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,884
Living it up like pimps!

463
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,683
Motherfucker, this is the shit!

464
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,962
Dude, this isn't work, man!
- Check this out! - I see it!

465
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,968
Check out the high tech stereo, man!

466
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,487
Look at us living like pimps!

467
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,849
This is the meeting place.

468
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,731
Where are your guys?

469
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,685
We had a deal.
- Five step, motherfucker!

470
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,362
I told you! This job requires know-how.
You have to come to me for lessons.

471
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,724
Stealing cars is dangerous.

472
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,565
At least that car was worth it!

473
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,769
Bitch, get out! Open the door, get out!

474
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,411
Have you ever seen a real movie?
- No, never.

475
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,570
Me, neither.

476
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,886
Let's go.

477
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,684
This movie rocks!

478
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,811
It's really moved you.
- Completely.

479
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,249
So now you won't leave here?

480
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,331
Do you remember the day

481
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,561
I asked you about your plans?

482
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,842
Yes.

483
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,848
Well, this is the job I want to do.

484
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,366
Work in a movie theatre?
- Are you slow! I want to be an actor!

485
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,006
No!

486
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,563
What, are you serious?
- Yes. I'm an actor already.

487
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,809
So actors are like you now?
- I'm serious!

488
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,642
I have an acting role at the Phoenix.
- Where's that?

489
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,651
Don't you know the Phoenix?

490
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,531
I've heard of it,
but I've never been there.

491
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,081
It's a nice place.

492
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,331
And the play we're working on is great.
- So you're some sort of celebrity?

493
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,320
Why didn't you tell me before?
- I don't know.

494
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,530
So can I come?

495
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,450
Yes, you can,
but I don't want Oti to know.

496
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,529
Especially about me acting.

497
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,722
Cool.

498
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,328
The play is this Saturday.

499
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,481
OK.

500
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,290
What 3,000?
- You faggot!

501
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,369
Give me the remaining 30,000!
- 30,000, my arse!

502
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,610
Bitch!
We agreed 50 per cent on every car!

503
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,403
How can 50 per cent of 120,000 be 30,000?
- Dude, what?

504
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,086
120,000?
- I'm the boss,

505
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,410
I decide how much 50 per cent is!
- Don't fuck with us! - What's going on?

506
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,008
The bitch is conning us.
- Dude,

507
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,249
you're holding us back?
- I taught you everything you know!

508
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,962
The money has to be paid.
- We did the work,

509
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,643
so now you have to pay us.
- I could just kill you!

510
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,846
Chill!

511
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,369
Don't waste your bullets!

512
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,322
Put your guns down!

513
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,962
When mine comes out, bullets will fly.

514
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,608
You've finished robbing everyone,
so now you're robbing each other?

515
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,849
It's not like that, officer.
This dog's stealing 30,000 from us.

516
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,845
Will you be bullied like kids?

517
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,405
In Gaza I make the laws!
- Maybe the young will reform you!

518
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,171
Why are you talking out of your arse?

519
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,963
Officer, how do you rule on this one?
- They should pay tax.

520
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,647
How many guns? 1, 2, 3?

521
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,570
30,000.

522
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,362
Pay up!

523
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,366
Right now.

524
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,803
Now go ahead and kill each other.

525
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,569
You have just fucked away my 30,000!

526
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,730
Bitch, that was our money!
- Chill, man!

527
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,885
Take it easy.

528
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,521
We can't let these guys go like that!
Let's go beat them up!

529
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,640
If we do nothing, they'll grow horns.

530
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,806
Dingo!

531
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,561
On the ground!

532
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,160
Get down!

533
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,529
Go on, get down!

534
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,767
Officer, we've found a man here.

535
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,407
Oh yeah, he's very dead.

536
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,401
So you think you have anything
to say here? Move! Move on, now!

537
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,604
Hey, wait a minute!

538
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,805
I want these people.

539
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,649
They're Nairobi's gangsters.

540
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,529
You, get out.
- Get out. Stand up, go on!

541
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,088
You, get out and stand over there!

542
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,926
Get down!

543
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,410
Right, thanks.

544
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,326
Let's go!

545
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,202
What's up? Get in there!

546
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,086
Get out!

547
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,565
Stay together!

548
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,405
Just stay together!

549
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,726
Let's go.

550
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,966
Get in there.

551
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,963
Dear Lord, we're dead.

552
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,651
What?

553
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,971
Sorry I didn't tell you, dude.

554
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,484
Tell me what?

555
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,487
We're now dead men walking.

556
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,565
What are you saying?

557
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,967
Why are we here?

558
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,644
Nairobi is full of unsolved crimes.

559
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,610
The cops have to round up some guys
from time to time to fool the public.

560
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,689
But why a whole gang?

561
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,369
What will happen to us?

562
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,890
They'll kill us and use our bodies

563
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,084
as evidence for something we didn't do.

564
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,166
They'll claim
we were shot in a shoot-out.

565
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,882
But our parents will come looking for us!

566
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,807
True. So what?

567
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,561
This cold is too much.

568
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,403
It'll kill me.

569
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,762
<i>Move aside, mistress,</i>

570
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,125
<i>all you bring is distress.</i>

571
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,764
<i>Move aside...</i>

572
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,808
Get up, go to the wall

573
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,085
and kneel down.

574
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,444
I said, get up,
go to the wall and kneel down!

575
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,846
Put up your hands!

576
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,085
You!

577
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,282
So?
- Please!

578
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,650
Please, don't kill me.
- Shut up. - Please, don't kill me!

579
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,809
What?
- Please, don't kill me!

580
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,924
You've decided it's you?
- Please, don't kill me!

581
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,641
Get up!

582
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,842
Haven't you volunteered yourself?
- No, I haven't! - Let's go.

583
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,769
We have to take them out.

584
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,561
Or they'll kill us all.
- No way! They've got guns!

585
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,326
You think you're bullet-proof?

586
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,286
Guys,

587
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,081
I'm not going down this way.
Look where your "brilliance" got us!

588
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,484
You got us into carjacking and guns.

589
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,686
You killed Dingo. And you still claim to
be our saviour? How stupid can you be?

590
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,850
What is this bullshit? - You're screwing
us like you've been screwing Amina!

591
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,608
You know Mose.

592
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,327
He talks out of his arse.

593
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,042
Stories about fucking aside,

594
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,884
right now we have to get out of here.

595
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,529
There are four of us.

596
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,126
We can take them out.
- And how?

597
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,440
How, Oti?

598
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,609
Listen, Oti,

599
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,602
I never slept with Amina.

600
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,041
Cool.

601
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,488
But I like her.

602
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,168
That makes two of us.

603
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,531
You know the drill.

604
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,361
As usual,

605
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,129
on your knees against the wall.

606
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,042
One,

607
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,041
two,

608
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,083
go!

609
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,410
Check if there are any others!

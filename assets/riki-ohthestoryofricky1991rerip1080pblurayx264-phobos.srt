1
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,126
Get out.

2
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,542
Step up and state your name, loud!

3
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,584
My name is Yeh Ming.

4
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:18,001
Yeh Ming, 37 years old. <i>7</i> years
for armed robbery and assault.

5
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,584
Go over!

6
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:27,126
Go over there!

7
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,542
Next, quickly!

8
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:30,876
Sir!

9
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,292
My name is Li Shan!

10
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:40,001
Li Shan, 28 years old.
5 years for embezzlement.

11
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,501
Go!

12
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:46,542
Stand over there.

13
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,084
Next!

14
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,959
Ricky Ho.

15
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,084
Step up!

16
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,959
Ricky Ho, 21 years old.
10 years for manslaughter and assault.

17
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,626
I didn't say you could go.

18
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,417
Carrying weapons?

19
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:46,751
Sir!

20
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,292
Let him go now.

21
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:57,501
Why not let a doctor

22
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,959
extract the 5 bullets from you?

23
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,292
They're souvenirs.

24
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:02,959
Give the three the initiation lecture.

25
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,626
Go!

26
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,209
The warden is at the top.

27
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,959
The second in command
is the assistant warden.

28
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:25,751
The four cells are controlled

29
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,292
by the Gang of Four.

30
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:31,001
You're new

31
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:35,001
and ineligible the see the warden,

32
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:38,876
but you must learn the rules.

33
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:44,251
Damn, getting up so early?

34
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,042
Captain, that towel's mine.

35
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,417
What?

36
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,626
You're confronting me over a towel?

37
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:10,834
Wild Cat is bullying again.

38
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,876
He's head of the underworld and the cell too.

39
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,376
He's a crony of the cell guards.

40
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,167
He's taking the law into his own hands.

41
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,834
Down on your knees and kowtow to him.

42
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,834
This car really is cute.

43
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,626
I assembled it
with wooden scraps as a toy.

44
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,584
So it's for your children.

45
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:44,334
I hear your application
for probation has been fixed.

46
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,292
Is that so?

47
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,959
But you can't get it without my okay!

48
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:56,042
Behave or you'll suffer!

49
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,959
Wild Cat, you bastard!

50
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,001
What's up?

51
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,292
Sir, Ma's getting old and clumsy.

52
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,209
He ran and fell on a blade.

53
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,501
He's whining like a pig.
What a nuisance.

54
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,209
Stop screaming! You're blind!

55
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,959
Don't run wild.

56
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,001
Captain,
we haven't brushed our teeth yet.

57
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,251
Use them as brushes.

58
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,584
Big brother!

59
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,292
What now?

60
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:56,917
Bastard, going to hell?

61
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,792
Are you speaking to me?

62
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:18,542
Have breakfast!

63
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,834
Captain, drink your milk.

64
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,751
Without a straw, I can't!

65
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,251
To hell with you!

66
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,376
Damn.

67
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,876
Ricky doesn't give a damn about me!

68
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:44,167
I must teach him a lesson or lose
my North Cell Killer title forever!

69
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,834
Captain, why not have
Silly Lung finish him off?

70
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,334
Silly Lung?

71
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:53,459
Yeah! He was hungry
and ate a horse the other day.

72
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,626
He's still in solitary.

73
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,376
When will he be out?

74
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,501
Tomorrow!

75
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,626
Take my allowance for this month.

76
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,584
Great, I need money.

77
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:20,126
Watch out. Silly Lung
makes trouble each time he's out.

78
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,959
No one dares to take
responsibility for anything serious.

79
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,459
Take it easy.

80
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,626
Me?

81
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,542
What? My probation
was rejected from above?

82
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,751
The captain promised...

83
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,126
Did you write home secretly?

84
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,584
No, sir, I'm innocent.

85
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,376
I really am innocent, sir!

86
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,959
Innocent?

87
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,001
You lie!

88
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,126
I didn't lie, sir. Believe me.

89
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:41,417
I'm dying to see my wife
and children at home, sir.

90
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:46,001
I've yearned to see them
from the day I got jailed.

91
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,084
Stop it!

92
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,459
Don't...

93
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,334
You're unlucky.

94
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,126
Don't, sir!

95
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,751
Don't, sir!

96
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:27,167
Ma's hanging himself to death!

97
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,751
Wild Cat bad-mouthed him.

98
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,459
And the warden canceled his probation.

99
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,626
Ma really is unlucky.

100
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,334
He was a model citizen.

101
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:44,959
He ran down someone while
rushing his wife to the hospital.

102
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,251
It should have just
been a traffic offense,

103
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:51,459
but he faced more charges
because the victim was a police officer.

104
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,251
So he got sent over here.

105
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:20,667
Ricky, what are you doing?

106
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:41,126
Take off his handcuffs.
He's already dead.

107
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,251
Ricky, don't do anything foolish!

108
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,001
Off...

109
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,959
Hurry up!

110
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,292
Next shift!

111
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:03,292
Shower, clean your laundry,
and use the toilet within 15 minutes.

112
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,292
Ricky!

113
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,626
Someone gave me 30 kgs
of rice to bump you off

114
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,584
and to mince you into meat pies.

115
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,001
Can you make it?

116
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,292
Silly Lung, come on,
I bet heavy on you.

117
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,792
Stop fighting!

118
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,251
One move and
those two are down.

119
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,751
Another move and I'll knock
you down. Come with me.

120
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,542
Making trouble already...

121
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:42,501
I want to have
a word with that kid, sir!

122
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:53,126
You really have guts.
I've never seen you before.

123
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,167
Nor have I seen you.

124
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,792
I'm the north cell's leader,
and your big brother.

125
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:09,584
After the assistant warden punishes you,
you'll be disciplined by our family rules.

126
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,542
I'll take you to the assistant
warden tomorrow. What a nuisance.

127
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,751
Are you Mr. Ho's son, Ricky?

128
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,209
You are...

129
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,334
I'm Uncle Shan Kuei.

130
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:47,292
Your original name was Rick.

131
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,709
But you were as strong
as a bull at <i>7</i> or 8,

132
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,917
so I called you Ricky.

133
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,126
Have you grown up as strong?

134
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:08,834
Stronger, of course.

135
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:12,417
Let me see!

136
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:14,459
Good!

137
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,542
Uncle!

138
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:39,917
I'm coming.

139
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:44,751
Uncle!

140
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,834
Ricky, you're as strong
as when you were a child.

141
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,834
So Uncle knows focus and breath control.

142
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,209
I want to learn it

143
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,542
to be a martial artist and help the weak.

144
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:16,459
Breath control requires a mild temper.

145
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:37,001
It accumulates energy
in the human body

146
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:41,292
and turns it into an inestimable
power against attacks.

147
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,834
The accumulation of energy
should be made freely.

148
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:59,792
Break this stone with your limbs.

149
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,209
See how I do it.

150
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:12,542
Now, ounces prevailing over tons.

151
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:40,459
Ricky, learn how to borrow strength.

152
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:47,126
Get stronger when
facing strength. Try it.

153
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,001
Okay!

154
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,542
I'll take you to the assistant warden.

155
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,876
Sir!

156
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,459
The prisoner is here.

157
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,917
Tell him to come in.

158
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,126
Stop!

159
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,376
Read me that file.

160
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:20,917
Yes, sir!

161
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:26,542
Ricky Ho, 21, blood type AB.

162
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:30,459
Parents unknown,
brought up in an orphanage.

163
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,959
He didn't do well
in primary and middle schools.

164
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:36,709
He joined a music college
to learn the flute.

165
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,251
He suddenly
disappeared as a senior.

166
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:47,001
He disappeared for two years and
fought triad members in major cities.

167
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,876
Then he was found
guilty for killing a man.

168
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:53,792
He was found by the court
to be a serious criminal.

169
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,167
That's all.

170
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,876
Where were you for those two years?

171
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,667
What did you do?

172
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:27,251
What? Turning a deaf ear?

173
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:36,459
How come you have scars
from five bullets on your chest?

174
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:45,792
You'll be in jail for quite some time.
You'll confess sooner or later.

175
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:52,126
We received a letter
for you this morning.

176
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:54,334
It contains a photograph.

177
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,334
Come have a look.

178
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,251
Don't take me for a fool.

179
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:16,709
Let me show you something.

180
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:23,542
Let me see how good the man who
killed Silly Lung and Wild Cat is.

181
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:31,709
You can take pain.
Are you a trained killer?

182
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,042
Speak up!

183
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:38,292
Ricky, are you
a special agent or CID?

184
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:42,167
If you're on
a special mission, I can help you.

185
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,334
I once arranged the accidental death

186
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:48,001
of a prisoner suspected of espionage.

187
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:56,584
Dumb bastard, you'll hurt
the moment you open your mouth.

188
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,167
Bet I'll finish you off.

189
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,876
Or have a taste of your bird.

190
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:07,459
She's a beautiful bird.
Let me take off her clothing.

191
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:38,626
You won't give up until I fight back!

192
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:42,542
Easy!

193
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:45,376
The warden's not here.
I'm number one!

194
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:48,542
Lay hands on me
and you'll be a corpse!

195
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,501
Ricky!

196
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,667
You're good. You threatening me?

197
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:22,751
Don't poke your nose
into my private affairs!

198
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:29,167
The punch hurts,
even without touching me.

199
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:31,542
What kind of demon are you?

200
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,042
Let me fly it!

201
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:29,001
Let's fly it together.

202
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,334
I'd rather do it alone.

203
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,626
Ying, look!

204
00:28:53,751 --> 00:29:00,584
<i>Ying is the incarnation of two fireflies.</i>

205
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:09,501
Come on...

206
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,959
Why play the trumpet at this hour?

207
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:52,001
A playboy keeps going to the toilet,

208
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:56,126
not knowing if he needs to or not.

209
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,876
Buddy, why so serious?

210
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:23,709
Stop acting. How many
have you destroyed as a fink?

211
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,376
I'm not a fink!

212
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,251
You even hurt Ma, you bastard!

213
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,334
I didn't do it!

214
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:35,292
Kuang, this kid is crazy.

215
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,001
Buddy, vent your feelings.

216
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,376
Do what you want to me.

217
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:49,209
Kid, listen.

218
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,751
Eat a bowl of shit now.

219
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:53,126
Then lick our shoes clean.

220
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:54,709
Then...

221
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,376
Kuang, what do you want?

222
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:00,584
I'll chop you
into 18 pieces and offer you to Ma.

223
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:03,584
Kuang, do you mean it?

224
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:07,001
Kuang, don't!

225
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,251
Kuang!

226
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:10,792
Kuang!

227
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,334
Hai!

228
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:24,209
Brother, help!

229
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,834
Keep away!

230
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,251
Kuang, don't go too far!

231
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:32,251
The assistant warden
won't let you go if you kill him.

232
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:37,959
Hai, he killed many
as a fink. We can't tolerate that.

233
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:43,251
But you know who can
enforce the family rules here.

234
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:44,917
Kuang,

235
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:49,959
repeat the north-cell
rules to the youngsters.

236
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:55,167
Only Hai can enforce the family rules.

237
00:31:56,501 --> 00:32:01,459
Let Centipede go
and forget the Ma incident.

238
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:08,626
Hai, if I were to forget this and that,

239
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,917
what good are the family rules?

240
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:16,001
You can't lead us
if you're not reasonable.

241
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:34,251
Not respecting a superior.
That's breaking a family rule!

242
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,667
Hai, you really are good.

243
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,167
Leave Kuang to me.

244
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:58,334
To hell with you, Kuang!

245
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,209
How are you going to handle Kuang?

246
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,334
By using him as bait to lure Ricky out.

247
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:21,459
I don't follow you.

248
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,792
Show something
to those prisoners in the north cell.

249
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:31,667
I'd be in trouble
if everybody was like Ricky.

250
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:37,126
Hai!

251
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:48,042
Use this knife
to enforce the family rules.

252
00:33:58,626 --> 00:34:00,792
Care for some mints?

253
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:09,167
Hai, show me your specialty.

254
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:40,001
You're friendly,
but you don't know the rules.

255
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:45,042
I thought you were brave,
but for the Gang of Four's reputation,

256
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,834
I must finish you off today.

257
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:01,084
Why don't you fight back?

258
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,626
Now, be fair.

259
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,667
Let Kuang go before fighting me.

260
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,167
I'm enforcing the family rules.

261
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:18,042
Hai kills when he shows
his tattoos. Just escape!

262
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:22,417
Ricky, Kuang's finished if you don't
fight back now. Come on, Ricky!

263
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:26,584
Come on, don't be afraid of him.

264
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,917
The broken glass
comes from the assistant warden.

265
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:46,917
See if you're as strong
after being blinded.

266
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:04,917
Blind, with cut tendons...

267
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:08,167
Ricky, you're finished.

268
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,959
Ricky, you're tops!

269
00:36:18,126 --> 00:36:19,251
Go on, Ricky!

270
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,334
There's a fight in the north cell.

271
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:31,792
They say Hai is
challenging Ricky to a duel!

272
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,167
Did anyone get killed?

273
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:34,334
Go and have a look!

274
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:40,459
Great...

275
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:44,792
You can see

276
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:48,251
your right arm's
crippled like a sandbag.

277
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:06,209
What's he doing?

278
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,542
He tied his tendons?

279
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,792
Ricky, you're great!

280
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,251
Hai, don't try anything foolish!

281
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,917
At worst, we die together!

282
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:47,376
Great, you're undoubtedly
one of the Gang of Four.

283
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:50,501
Seems you won't
give up until you die.

284
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,959
Great...

285
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:14,959
Ricky's great! Ricky's superb!

286
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,126
Kuang's dead!

287
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,834
Ricky, Kuang's dead!

288
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:46,167
He's dead?

289
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:52,292
Kuang!

290
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:55,126
Today's mints are bitter.

291
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,792
Assistant warden, you got him killed.

292
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:00,251
We must kill him to avenge Kuang.

293
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:03,126
Finish him off!

294
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,542
Bump him off!

295
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,292
What are you doing?
Turning against me?

296
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,584
Aren't you afraid of the Gang of Four?

297
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,001
With Ricky here,
we're afraid of no one.

298
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,876
Not even you. I'll kill you too.

299
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:32,417
Ricky, let me introduce
west cell's Huang Chuan,

300
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:38,959
east cell's Taizan, and south cell's god.

301
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:44,084
Finish off these three
if you've got the guts.

302
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,626
Ricky, don't worry!

303
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:48,084
Let's join forces to finish him off!

304
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,584
Ricky, come on!

305
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:55,042
Ricky!

306
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:57,251
Ricky, do in those bastards!

307
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,667
Kill them to avenge Kuang and Ma.

308
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,126
Go back.

309
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:05,834
We want no more death
after Kuang and Hai.

310
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:18,709
Ricky, do you want to become
one of the Gang of Four?

311
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:28,959
Sha? Hai's godson.

312
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,667
He must be sad
over his godfather's death.

313
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:27,042
Lighter, not so hard,

314
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,667
and roll your tongue.

315
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:52,792
Hai's dead. Aren't you sad?

316
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,459
Your tongue got cut off?

317
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:32,792
Hey! Try to play this.
It has a better sound.

318
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,001
How could you have
gotten poppy leaves?

319
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:53,001
In the west cell?

320
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:06,667
What happened, Huang Chuan?

321
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:16,709
Sha told Ricky about the poppy leaves.

322
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,959
What? A mute exposed it?

323
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,584
You think I lied?

324
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,251
Sha defected
to Ricky and betrayed us.

325
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:26,876
And you're in the dark about it.

326
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,042
We need evidence to do anything.

327
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,584
If Sha did become a fink

328
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,792
even a revived Hai couldn't protect him.

329
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:38,626
Sha!

330
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,959
Damn it, keep cool!

331
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:00,417
Sha, this is Hai's weapon!

332
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:03,584
Kin can avenge the deceased,
according to the family law.

333
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,834
Use this to get rid of Ricky.

334
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,667
Look, Hai died a tragic death.

335
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:27,626
Aren't you, a youngster,
going to avenge him?

336
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:38,876
Traitor!

337
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:46,209
This time we won't
only cut off your tongue.

338
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:04,042
Isn't it Sha? What's become of him?

339
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,084
Yes, it's Sha.

340
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:09,626
Almost all of his skin
has been peeled off.

341
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:13,209
Huang Chuan must've done it.

342
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:16,751
Sha really is unlucky.

343
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:19,417
He was new and witnessed "that."

344
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:22,084
He had half of his tongue
cut off by Huang Chuan,

345
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:24,667
and now he died a tragic death.

346
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:26,501
What do you mean by "that"?

347
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:30,501
Ricky, forget it.
Don't antagonize Huang Chuan.

348
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,584
But Sha knew full well.

349
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,167
After Hai's death,
he wouldn't live long either.

350
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:25,334
Devil!

351
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:32,584
What? Ricky knows
about the poppies?

352
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:36,042
What's wrong with you three?

353
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:53,292
A fire in the west cell?

354
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,917
How come? Damn it!

355
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:04,251
Must be arson!

356
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:11,376
Damn, it really is burning!

357
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:20,251
You bastards,
you grow opium in the cells?

358
00:48:20,626 --> 00:48:22,667
So you are the arsonist.

359
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:26,167
I'll kill you for Sha's sake!

360
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:34,709
Now it's the west cell that's in trouble.

361
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,542
A fire for no reason!

362
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,584
Why's there a sour smell?

363
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:44,209
Huang Chuan grew
opium in the greenhouse.

364
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:52,084
You squeezed poppies into juice,
and dried it to make opium.

365
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:54,376
You traded this juice for human blood.

366
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,834
Bastard, you burned up my lifeblood.

367
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:58,251
I won't let you go!

368
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:07,251
Huang Chuan
knows unorthodox kung fu.

369
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:29,959
I've hit your heart muscle
in a fatal spot. You'll die soon.

370
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:55,792
We can leave once
this cell is burned down.

371
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:14,376
Lock up those criminals.

372
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:15,542
Yes!

373
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,501
Go now!

374
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:22,459
Sir, the fire brigade
called to ask what happened.

375
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:26,417
Tell them we're burning rubbish.

376
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:31,167
Sir!

377
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:34,167
A call from the police station now?

378
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,251
No, a call from the warden saying
he's returning from Hawaii tomorrow.

379
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,126
What? Why so serious?

380
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,459
He's coming back ahead of schedule?

381
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,542
Raise the zero alarm!

382
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:50,376
Zero? Huang Chuan
and Ricky are outside.

383
00:50:52,626 --> 00:50:54,001
Just do as I say.

384
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:55,042
Yes!

385
00:50:58,334 --> 00:51:01,209
One looks beautiful before dying,

386
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,042
especially a man.

387
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:08,667
I won't let you off easy
for burning the poppies.

388
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:11,709
Nor will the master!

389
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:25,876
Ricky, prepare yourself
and be a messenger for hell.

390
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,209
You've even broken my technique.

391
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:54,001
No wonder they call you a demon.

392
00:51:54,459 --> 00:51:57,501
But you can't

393
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,167
live through tonight.

394
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,417
Huang Chuan, catch!

395
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:33,917
Now I'm going to cremate you.

396
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:42,459
Ricky can't die till
I've had a duel with him alone.

397
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:44,542
Taizan, you're out of your mind!

398
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:48,792
Zero alarm.

399
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:52,792
All men back to the cells in one
minute or you'll be shot on sight.

400
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:56,251
We must beat Ricky quickly
and get back to the cells.

401
00:52:58,126 --> 00:53:01,709
Damn, keep away,
or you'll be done in too!

402
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:08,709
Creep, you're really vexing me!

403
00:53:22,584 --> 00:53:25,292
Ricky, I'll stay
for a duel with you here.

404
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:57,501
You really are hell-bent.

405
00:53:57,876 --> 00:54:00,626
I have to show
the poppies to everybody.

406
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:11,626
Once the cement on him dries,
he won't even be able to lift a toe.

407
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,417
The proof's gone forever then!

408
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:37,834
Break Taizan's cement.

409
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:43,251
Let me handle the warden,
then I'll take care of Ricky.

410
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:12,001
With me here, it's going to be okay.

411
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:43,751
The warden's back. Open up!

412
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:46,542
Open up!

413
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:49,417
Open up! The warden is back!

414
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:52,501
The warden is back!

415
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:56,959
Get up...

416
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:00,209
Stand still!

417
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,126
Warden, you're back!

418
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:39,459
Young master,
had a good time in Hawaii?

419
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,542
Young master.

420
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:02,542
Did you get hurt? Seriously?

421
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:08,917
It's all right.

422
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:15,459
Who rolled out the carpet?

423
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:18,959
I didn't do it!

424
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:20,501
This prisoner did, sir!

425
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:21,959
You did?

426
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,959
It's not my fault, warden! Let me go!

427
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:31,459
Why didn't you check to see
if the carpet was all right?

428
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:33,876
Have you got eyes?

429
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:44,084
If you can't see clearly,
have one eye less!

430
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,792
What happened during my absence?

431
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,417
Some prisoners disobeyed.

432
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:13,167
Some died.

433
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:15,834
Several criminals died
in a month. What's wrong?

434
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:18,542
Since the prison was privatized,

435
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:22,876
the prisoners have become
the cheapest and best labor force.

436
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:27,126
Take good care of them to avoid
death from hunger or illness.

437
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:30,042
Young master, eating a candle?

438
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:32,542
Keep a close eye on those prisoners.

439
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:36,917
It's sugar.

440
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:43,459
Anything else?

441
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:52,126
The poppy field was
burned down last night.

442
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:55,376
What? Why...

443
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:02,042
Bring medicine, quick!

444
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,417
Yes!

445
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,584
My medicine!

446
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:42,834
Warden, it was him!

447
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:55,917
Don't worry!

448
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:16,501
I waited for you the whole night.

449
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:19,959
Kill him! Kill him quick!

450
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:22,126
Ricky, want to get killed?

451
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:24,042
Is the poppy field yours?

452
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:42,167
Ricky, let's have a hand-to-hand fight!

453
01:00:44,584 --> 01:00:46,376
Warden, sit down for a while.

454
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:50,917
Taizan is the best kung fu
fighter in the Gang of Four.

455
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,167
Ricky's finished for sure.

456
01:00:54,376 --> 01:00:57,084
I haven't okayed his death yet.

457
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:00,626
Warden, have it your way.

458
01:01:19,084 --> 01:01:21,709
You really have guts.
You put your hands on the warden.

459
01:01:24,459 --> 01:01:26,334
Bravo...

460
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:34,834
One, two, three, four, five, six. Six!

461
01:01:37,459 --> 01:01:39,667
How is it? Tastes good!

462
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:41,292
That's all?

463
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:44,084
Have some more, if that's not enough.

464
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,459
Warden, it's his "Open Coconut" technique.

465
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:54,042
It could burst Ricky's head.

466
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:34,167
Get up quick, Taizan!

467
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,709
You're good for nothing!
You're finished so soon!

468
01:02:37,001 --> 01:02:42,334
Shut up. We're people, not insects.

469
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:58,417
You really are okay.

470
01:02:58,584 --> 01:03:01,376
No wonder you made trouble in the cells.

471
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:05,917
Scum, you grew
opium and killed many!

472
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:09,751
Ricky, what do you want?

473
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:12,501
He won't tell!

474
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:15,292
But once the metal plate crushes him...

475
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:40,292
Great, Ricky Ho,
your conditioning is good.

476
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:41,959
Let me help you.

477
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:47,542
This is the latest taser
with 100,000 volts.

478
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:07,126
You'll turn into a dried persimmon.

479
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:18,959
Taizan, you're still alive?

480
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:23,751
Warden, you forgot I was inside?

481
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:26,001
Rubbish!

482
01:04:26,584 --> 01:04:28,792
I've always been loyal.

483
01:04:28,959 --> 01:04:32,959
Loyal? You're a heap
of scraps to be cleaned up!

484
01:04:36,709 --> 01:04:38,667
Taizan, come out quick!

485
01:04:41,459 --> 01:04:44,376
Ricky, I can't hold on.

486
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:48,167
Mommy, I'll have to leave you...

487
01:05:12,126 --> 01:05:14,917
Each prisoner has relatives
awaiting their release!

488
01:05:15,126 --> 01:05:18,001
You can't throw them away
like some dirty tablecloth!

489
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:23,042
You can't get out anyway, idiot.

490
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:29,209
Summon all prisoners
to the compound tomorrow.

491
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:30,751
Yes, sir!

492
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:49,542
Warden, please!

493
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:58,417
I must seriously punish Ricky Ho.

494
01:05:58,834 --> 01:06:01,542
Everybody, throw a spade of clay in!

495
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,667
Are we to bury Ricky alive?

496
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:11,709
Yes. You want us to do
the dirty work, don't you?

497
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:12,334
Don't you?

498
01:06:14,084 --> 01:06:15,834
Tell them to start.

499
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:21,209
Burly and Breakdown, you start now.
Everyone else goes after them!

500
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,251
Ricky, what shall we do now?

501
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:49,209
Do as he orders. You're no match.

502
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,167
Are you going to die?

503
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:53,792
What?

504
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:56,667
Say it when you visit his grave.

505
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:03,251
Ricky, hold on!

506
01:07:11,376 --> 01:07:12,334
Ricky, hold on!

507
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:13,584
Next!

508
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,751
Ricky, hold on!

509
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:21,459
Keep away!

510
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:27,459
Ricky, hold on!

511
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:36,792
Listen, everybody.

512
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:44,126
I'll let Ricky go if he lasts a week!

513
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:46,001
Great!

514
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:53,626
Hold on...

515
01:07:57,167 --> 01:08:01,167
This oxygen tube
can last you seven days.

516
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:06,751
Come over quickly. Pack him in.

517
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:23,084
Can Ricky last seven days?

518
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:26,792
Let's wish him luck!

519
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:30,709
If he dies, it's our fault!

520
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:41,876
Ricky!

521
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:44,459
Ricky?

522
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,917
He's still alive!

523
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,876
He's still alive!

524
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:54,334
Good, he keeps going
even when buried alive.

525
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:19,251
Huang Chuan, you really are terrific!

526
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:27,126
Your windpipe is clogging up.

527
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:53,126
Brother, she saw us selling powder.
We brought her back for your pleasure.

528
01:10:53,209 --> 01:10:55,834
Then let's decide how to dispose of her.

529
01:10:56,376 --> 01:10:59,126
No way! If an old woman should see,

530
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:00,959
would you bring her
to me all the same?

531
01:11:01,001 --> 01:11:02,959
Brother, take your time.

532
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,501
Sword of the Green Dragon clan.

533
01:12:04,126 --> 01:12:07,459
Damn, how dare he call my name?

534
01:12:56,042 --> 01:13:02,167
Keep away!

535
01:13:33,126 --> 01:13:36,792
Seven days of rain
makes the earth cold and wet.

536
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,876
If he's alive, he must be a superman.

537
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:56,417
Ricky!

538
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:57,459
He's dead!

539
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:58,584
What a tragedy!

540
01:13:59,626 --> 01:14:00,292
Ricky!

541
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:01,501
He's moving.

542
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:04,501
He's still alive, just asleep!

543
01:14:04,751 --> 01:14:06,292
What? Asleep in such a situation?

544
01:14:16,834 --> 01:14:18,209
Ricky's great!

545
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:48,376
Move him quickly!

546
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:07,001
Ricky, you're the stoutest
kid I have ever seen.

547
01:15:07,459 --> 01:15:09,001
Let's be friends, okay?

548
01:15:10,501 --> 01:15:12,542
A wolf and a pig can't be friends.

549
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:16,792
You destroyed many people
by growing opium in the cells!

550
01:15:16,876 --> 01:15:19,001
I must settle this with you.

551
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:20,834
Don't talk so much.

552
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,084
You bastards!

553
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:28,334
Let's be enemies then.

554
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:31,959
What else did you do besides
investigating the opium case?

555
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:35,376
Shorty, come on!

556
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:36,709
Okay!

557
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:45,501
You disappeared for two years,
according to the files. Where were you?

558
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:50,376
So long as you live,
I'll beat the truth out of you.

559
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:55,334
Let me.

560
01:16:18,751 --> 01:16:22,459
You lured me out.
What else do you want?

561
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:34,042
You must answer
my question before you die!

562
01:16:38,626 --> 01:16:40,334
Warden, are you okay?

563
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:44,376
The day you know my secret
is the day of your death.

564
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:48,459
Assistant warden.

565
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:49,709
Warden!

566
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:51,751
Bring the medicine, quick!

567
01:17:13,042 --> 01:17:15,459
Ricky!

568
01:17:18,084 --> 01:17:21,917
Ricky, I've brought
something for you to eat.

569
01:17:23,501 --> 01:17:25,376
You haven't eaten for a whole week!

570
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:27,709
You're our savior.

571
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,542
Ricky, eat now, eat!

572
01:17:50,584 --> 01:17:52,209
The warden's tough.

573
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:54,709
Watch your back, Ricky!

574
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,417
<i>Be strong</i>

575
01:18:04,751 --> 01:18:06,459
I'll come back tomorrow.

576
01:18:26,584 --> 01:18:28,501
Why's that creep here?

577
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,251
Fa!

578
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:36,501
Centipede is backbiting again.

579
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:52,251
Ricky, I have a present for you.

580
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:12,501
You'll die mutilated today.

581
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:18,667
Now it's your turn.

582
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,417
Ricky, don't try anything foolish!

583
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:27,876
Emergency.
Mobilize the task force.

584
01:19:28,042 --> 01:19:28,834
Emergency, over!

585
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:30,251
They'll arrive in one minute, over.

586
01:19:30,334 --> 01:19:32,084
- Over!
- Fa!

587
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:34,626
Ricky, Fa can't hold on.

588
01:19:37,876 --> 01:19:38,876
Fa!

589
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:43,251
Ricky, are you all right?

590
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:45,542
Thanks for bringing me some food.

591
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:50,917
Fa!

592
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:54,542
Assistant warden!

593
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:59,084
You killed Fa. Don't run away!

594
01:20:03,667 --> 01:20:05,376
You killed Fa!

595
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:06,834
You murderer!

596
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:11,626
Punch him!

597
01:20:18,334 --> 01:20:20,459
We'll take your life today.

598
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,501
You cockroaches want to die, don't you?

599
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:36,542
Cockroaches? Bastard!

600
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,334
Sock him!

601
01:20:56,209 --> 01:20:57,876
Take me to the warden.

602
01:21:09,959 --> 01:21:13,126
Warden, tomorrow's menu
for the prisoners is ready.

603
01:21:13,209 --> 01:21:14,834
Your instructions, please.

604
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:19,917
Preserved beans, vegetables,
and meat pies for tomorrow's lunch.

605
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,667
Don't you think
there are too many dishes?

606
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:27,834
Halve the vegetables
and preserved beans.

607
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,876
Keep the meat pies for supper.

608
01:21:33,209 --> 01:21:36,626
Be good.

609
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,126
The prisoners won't die of hunger.

610
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:40,376
Right!

611
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:52,251
You get fish and meat
and feed the dog steak too.

612
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:57,626
Not enough food?
Let me give you some more.

613
01:22:08,792 --> 01:22:10,376
Enough now?

614
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:19,334
We're humans, not beasts!

615
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:24,084
If criminals are human, then flies
and cockroaches are human too.

616
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:33,334
Ricky!

617
01:22:36,126 --> 01:22:37,584
What is it?

618
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:44,459
Warden, riots. Central control has been
disrupted, and the alarm's not working.

619
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:49,126
Let's see how tough
you cockroaches can be.

620
01:22:55,251 --> 01:22:57,667
Warden, don't shoot!

621
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:05,584
They rioted only due
to your mismanagement.

622
01:23:05,626 --> 01:23:07,751
You asked for it.

623
01:23:07,751 --> 01:23:09,334
Warden, help!

624
01:23:09,876 --> 01:23:12,751
My gun's for shooting elephants only.

625
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:23,876
Ricky, your turn.

626
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:27,626
After you die, the prisoners will
return to their cells themselves.

627
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:29,709
Bastard, Ricky won't die.

628
01:23:29,709 --> 01:23:31,792
Who wants to die now?

629
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:44,209
You bastards trying to turn against me?

630
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:56,626
Warden, I'll go and bring some men in.

631
01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:07,751
Bastard, I'll fight you!

632
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:11,667
Go through the back.

633
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:30,709
Young master,
push this button. It's fun.

634
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:38,334
You two, help me fix Ricky.

635
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:10,751
Huang Chuan, it's not
a tournament. Finish him off quickly!

636
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,542
I'll cripple you
so you can never kill again.

637
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:35,209
Don't...

638
01:25:40,876 --> 01:25:43,709
Don't kill me...

639
01:25:57,626 --> 01:26:00,542
I nearly forgot
you can even stand bullets.

640
01:26:01,584 --> 01:26:02,834
Come here!

641
01:26:03,126 --> 01:26:06,917
Take him back to his room. If those
cockroaches get in the way, shoot them.

642
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:14,292
Ricky, see if you can kill me now.

643
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,042
You still have power?

644
01:26:16,126 --> 01:26:17,959
I mean what I say.

645
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:21,834
A warden must be a master of kung fu.

646
01:26:22,292 --> 01:26:23,959
Now, see for yourself!

647
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:09,334
Ricky, use what you've got.

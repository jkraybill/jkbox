1
00:00:55,472 --> 00:01:03,472
Ju dou

2
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:45,431
Starring:
Gong li, li baotian, li wei

3
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,990
Directors:
Zhang yimou, Yang fengliang

4
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:25,312
The Yang family's dye mill

5
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,783
Uncle!

6
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,410
You took long enough!

7
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,578
There were bandits...

8
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,539
How come they didn't kill you?

9
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,421
How much money is there?

10
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,090
Count it yourself.

11
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,304
Hey, boy!

12
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,725
Tianqing, you're back!

13
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,733
Don't bother to come back
tomorrow.

14
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,489
With only that boy for help,

15
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,741
I turned down many orders.

16
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,122
The horse looks much thinner.

17
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,758
Go, now. We start work early
in the morning.

18
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,763
Hey. — what took you so long?

19
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,641
I was doing all your work.

20
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,769
I did my best,
but those bandits...

21
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,647
Look at my hands...

22
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,275
They're as black as coal.

23
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,895
For all that work your uncle
paid me only two dollars.

24
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,779
The miser!

25
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,620
Your uncle bought himself
another wife. Did you see her?

26
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,773
I just saw the
wedding decorations.

27
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:12,169
Her name is ju dou.
A good—looker...

28
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,132
And expensive.

29
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,761
Your uncle is cheap.

30
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,638
Did you know he tortured your
first two aunts

31
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,766
to death?

32
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,351
They didn't give him
any children.

33
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,145
It served him right.

34
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,737
Listen how your new aunt...

35
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,156
Screams at night.

36
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,760
I'll kill you!

37
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,388
Let me rest a while.

38
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:12,770
Let you rest? You'll never make an heir
for the Yang family!

39
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,564
You're not good for nothing!

40
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,140
Go, call your aunt.

41
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,208
Aunt...

42
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,544
My uncle wants you
to come downstairs.

43
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,343
You realize what time it is,
dear lady?

44
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,471
You're very late.

45
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,725
I didn't buy a freeloader!

46
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,732
Hey... master Yang!

47
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,110
Master Yang! — why?

48
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,613
Master liu wants these
in a hurry.

49
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,741
He wants two in bright red,
and...

50
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,744
Five in golden yellow.

51
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,246
Sure.

52
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,582
26 pounds, 7 ounces.

53
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,628
Master Yang...

54
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,133
With so much work...
Why not hire someone?

55
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,094
That would add to my expenses.

56
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,179
Tianqing is enough.

57
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,767
Tianqing is in his forties.
He ought to get married.

58
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,521
That would be one more
mouth to feed.

59
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,774
It might help you.

60
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,778
We'll wait and see.

61
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,781
She wouldn't cost much.

62
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,785
Tianqing is almost like a son.

63
00:08:56,202 --> 00:09:00,665
A son? Bullshit!
He doesn't have my blood.

64
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,420
That orphan wouldn't have
survived if I hadn't adopted him...

65
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,422
After his parents died.

66
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,716
My son wouldn't be
as dumb as he is.

67
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,142
Careful, huh!

68
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,520
If you ruin that,
you'd better watch out!

69
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,187
Tianqing...

70
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,275
Don't waste any pigment
while you measure it.

71
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,097
I bought you, now obey me.

72
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,728
When I buy an animal,
I treat it as I wish.

73
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,732
And you're no better
than an animal.

74
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,246
You love that, eh?

75
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:12,774
Obey me. Give me a son,
and I'll be your slave.

76
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,777
Otherwise, watch out!

77
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,214
Tianqing! — yes.

78
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,173
Tianqing!

79
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,551
What are you doing?

80
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,344
Hurry up!

81
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,721
I'm coming.

82
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,225
It's already very late.

83
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,226
I'm coming!

84
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,227
Hurry!

85
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:51,682
All you're learned
is how to be lazy.

86
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,769
You could at least answer.

87
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,325
These are delicate dye jobs.
Ask for higher prices.

88
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,332
Learn how to bargain.
Don't sell at a loss.

89
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,459
Choose inexpensive inns.

90
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,337
Don't spend more than you earn.

91
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,589
I'll go to the stable.

92
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,748
Hear the bell, ding, dong!

93
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,751
Here we are at village wang!

94
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,380
So many dogs... here they come!

95
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,632
They bite us all...
But we can't run!

96
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,093
Jinshan, you bought lanterns?
— yes

97
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,219
you are looking good. — yes.

98
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,596
Go, make children...

99
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,474
It brings good luck.

100
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,651
You've come back?

101
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,781
Aunt...

102
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,284
What happened to your face?

103
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,539
I was careless and fell down.

104
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,421
Your uncle is killing the pig.

105
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,301
It's an offering for
the moon festival.

106
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,770
Aunt... you've hurt your arm?

107
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,777
Yes, when I fell down.
I'm so clumsy.

108
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,116
Let's go home.

109
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,413
You're so skinny.
Tonight we'll eat pork.

110
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,756
You hear those screaming?
They cry for help.

111
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,084
Are you satisfied?

112
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,670
So good?

113
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,715
I can't stand it anymore!

114
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,722
Who?

115
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,225
It's me.

116
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,727
It's you, tianqing?

117
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,687
Yes.

118
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,355
Did you feed the horse?

119
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,107
Yes.

120
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,694
Is my aunt sick?

121
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,738
It's nothing.

122
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,367
It's a little indigestion...
Something she ate.

123
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,745
Is it serious?

124
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,247
I'll go get li, the healer.

125
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,708
It's not necessary.

126
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,711
She's already feeling better.

127
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,504
I'll go to bed.

128
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,756
Yes.

129
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,508
What was that noise?

130
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,636
It scared me.

131
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,389
It was too dark.

132
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,268
Who knows?

133
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,093
Aunt...

134
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,595
What's wrong?

135
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,180
Tianqing,

136
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,225
I want to tell you...

137
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,061
Your uncle will kill me
sooner or later.

138
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,730
I can't go on.

139
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,735
Let him kill me. Don't stop him.

140
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,737
I don't want to live anymore.

141
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,117
He does have a bad temper.

142
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,745
He's not human. He's not a man.

143
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,961
Tianqing, I'll tell you the truth.
The old man's sick.

144
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,757
He can't do it!
All he does is torture me.

145
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,387
I really can't go on.

146
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,766
I can't take it any more.

147
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,495
Did you feed him
during the trip?

148
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,749
Three times a day,
and once at night.

149
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,300
He may have colic.

150
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:59,266
Zhang wants his light blue...
And tsui wants his pink.

151
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,911
Here's
the cloth. Don't waste any fuel.

152
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,145
I know. — go back.

153
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,415
Rest easy, tianqing.

154
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:30,589
His horse is sick.

155
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,344
Aunt...

156
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,519
Wake me up tomorrow.
I'll start working early.

157
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,306
I sleep like a log.

158
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,738
Really? Since when?

159
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,368
He's not here.
What are you afraid of?

160
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,753
You're really a log!

161
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,121
Tianqing... are you afraid?

162
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,374
Me? Afraid?

163
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,504
Then why did you
latch your door?

164
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,261
You're a grown man...

165
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,400
Am I a wolf?

166
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,782
You think I'll eat you?

167
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:45,367
My uncle...

168
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:48,412
He can go to hell!

169
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,748
If someone comes by...

170
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,377
That didn't stop you from
looking through the hole...

171
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,551
Why didn't you plug it up?

172
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:13,061
Tianqing...

173
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,314
I've kept my body for you.

174
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,497
My prescription worked well.

175
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,748
She's pregnant.

176
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,084
Really?

177
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,252
Is it a boy or a girl?

178
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,464
With some luck, a boy.

179
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:30,012
Ancestors...

180
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:34,142
Grant me a son! Let the Yang family line
continue forever, ancestors.

181
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:40,773
I'll be forever grateful to you.

182
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,777
I'll shower you with gifts
if it's a boy.

183
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,654
Ju do...

184
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,781
Ju dou. — tianqing!

185
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,534
Are you pregnant?

186
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,161
Yes.

187
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,125
And that old bastard
thinks it's his.

188
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,503
Tianqing, I counted the days:

189
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,505
The child is yours.

190
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,760
Ju dou...

191
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,431
Eat well, sleep well,

192
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,683
and make us a fat boy!

193
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,521
I'll leave now.
The old man mustn't see me.

194
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,162
Jinshan! Jinshan!

195
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,457
It's a really fat baby

196
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,210
with a watering spout between his legs.

197
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:46,047
Jinshan! She had a boy!

198
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,468
My son!

199
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:18,747
For his generation...
There are very few good first names left.

200
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,333
Just make one up.

201
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,084
Idiot!

202
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,379
The ancestors knew best.

203
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,007
You can outwit them!

204
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,385
He is the only Yang heir.

205
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,598
One bad first name
could mean the end of the family line.

206
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,662
Yang tianbai...

207
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,415
Yang tianqing...

208
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,753
Qing and ball that means purity!

209
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,715
Those are the two best names
beginning with tian.

210
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,100
Nice toy.

211
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,436
Soon tianbai will play with it.

212
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,734
Hang the cloths quietly.

213
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,613
Your aunt and tianbai are asleep.

214
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,666
You're all mine! — tianqmg.

215
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,907
I love you. — you're all mine.

216
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,383
I thought I was dying
and I'd never see you again.

217
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,680
Be quiet... be quiet!

218
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,568
Doesn't he look like you?

219
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,071
Like me?

220
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,573
Look at him.

221
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,455
He's your son.

222
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,718
My breasts are swollen.

223
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,105
Too much milk?

224
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,564
Yes.

225
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,445
You're getting silly.

226
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,115
You want some?

227
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,325
Does it hurt?

228
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,245
Suck it.

229
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,758
Now, go.

230
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,637
The old man might come back...

231
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,474
No, he won't come back now.

232
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,145
Aren't you afraid
he'll kill you with an axe?

233
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,772
It's hard to say
who will kill whom.

234
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,777
You talk big behind his back,
you big devil!

235
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,174
One day he'll find out the truth.

236
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,178
It won't be easy to kill us all.

237
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,562
Uncle!

238
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,399
Uncle!

239
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,944
Uncle!

240
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,705
Unclel... uncle!

241
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,707
What happened to you?

242
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,043
Uncle!

243
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,724
Uncle!

244
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,738
Uncle!

245
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,591
He is paralyzed.

246
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,761
He's not going to die.

247
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,390
But he can no longer function...
From the waist down.

248
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,268
As sure as death.

249
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,694
I'll kill you, bitch!

250
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,447
Don't you dare!

251
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,624
Slut!

252
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,377
I'll kill you!

253
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,719
You still want to hurt me?

254
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,390
Filthy beast! Nothing but shit!

255
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,608
You can do nothing about it.

256
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:31,114
God gave me tianqing.

257
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,283
Now, listen!

258
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,412
Tianqing is tianbai's father.

259
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:38,788
It serves you right!

260
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,054
Tianqing,

261
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,265
why doesn't tianbai ever laugh?

262
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,268
Don't worry, he'll soon laugh.

263
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,446
Hear the bell, ding dong.

264
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,324
Here we are at village wang.

265
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:20,663
So many dogs here they come.

266
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,709
They attack us but we can't run!

267
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:29,714
We can't run, so we go home.

268
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:35,595
Play the horn just for fun.

269
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,724
Hear the bell, ding dong.

270
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,734
Kill him! Kill that old bastard!

271
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,743
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

272
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:02,306
You touch my son again
and see what happens!

273
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,059
Ju dou,

274
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,520
sleep with our son
without worry.

275
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:14,277
If you want to die, say so.
I'll help you.

276
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,712
Tianqing, tianqing!

277
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,150
You wanted to burn up my family?

278
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,279
You old bastard!
You won't succeed.

279
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,493
It isn't that easy!

280
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,748
We'll keep you alive a long time.

281
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,751
Keep on breathing, you devil!

282
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:05,633
Tianqing and I
will take good care of you...

283
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,053
So you can watch us
as we live happily.

284
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,388
You understand?

285
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,089
Where are you going?

286
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,466
It's a beautiful day.

287
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:02,731
Jinshan... you're so lucky.

288
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,360
Tianqing takes care of you
like a son would.

289
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,782
Ancestors... look...

290
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,785
Open your eyes wide...

291
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,456
Look at those two filthy beasts!

292
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,722
Oh, my poor ancestors!

293
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,742
I'm worried.

294
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,372
Tianqing is big,
but he still doesn't talk.

295
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,623
Is he mute?

296
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,750
That's nonsense.

297
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,756
He's slow to talk,
but he'll talk sooner or later.

298
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,760
Tianbai! Tianbai, call me daddy.

299
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,514
If he does,
would you dare reply?

300
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,779
Anyway, he is your son.

301
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,783
We'll tell him when he's older.

302
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,385
Let's go.

303
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,764
Wait, tianbai is here.

304
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,769
It's been a long time...
I'd like to...

305
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,773
What are you afraid of?

306
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,567
He's our son. Let's go!

307
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,620
Tianqing,

308
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,456
my period is late.

309
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,461
If I'm pregnant,
it would be a big problem.

310
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,143
Tianbai!

311
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,731
Tianbai! — tianbai!

312
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,802
Tianbai!

313
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,431
Tianbai!

314
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,768
Tianbai!

315
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,201
Daddy!

316
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,786
Daddy!

317
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,580
You can say, "daddy"?

318
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,209
Who's your daddy?

319
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,045
Daddyl... daddy!

320
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,105
Tianbail... my son!

321
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:22,444
Of course, I'm your father!
My son!

322
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,743
I'm your father! I'm your father!

323
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,747
Tianbai! Call me! — daddy!

324
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,748
Louder. — daddy!

325
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,752
Again! — daddy!

326
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,384
Tianbai,

327
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,760
come here.

328
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,389
That's your mama. — mama...

329
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,101
That's your brother.
— brother...

330
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,479
And I'm your father. — daddy...

331
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,482
My son,

332
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,152
you're a good boy.

333
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,779
Remember to call us that way.

334
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,416
Don't take it so hard.

335
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,754
He's too young to understand.

336
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:29,261
When he's older
we'll tell him everything.

337
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:43,442
I don't know why
my period was so late...

338
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,153
I was scared.

339
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,198
We'll have to do something.

340
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,785
Take this.

341
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,165
Apply it beforehand.
You'll be safe.

342
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:11,720
Does it work?

343
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,224
The old nun said it'll work
after I use it 10 times.

344
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,731
Ju dou!

345
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:29,571
Ju dou!

346
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,697
Wash yourself.

347
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,044
It's time to extend good wishes.

348
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:36,263
Today tianbai is three years old.
I wish him great happiness.

349
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,682
I only have one thing to say:

350
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,267
Live a long life...

351
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,062
And continue
the Yang family line.

352
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,442
Let's have a toast!

353
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,823
Jinshan... has a good son.

354
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:59,703
Tianqing has a good brother.
Good luck!

355
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:00,828
Let's drink a toast!

356
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,332
It's tianqing's turn

357
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,419
to extend his wishes to tianbai.

358
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,715
Aunt, pour your nephew a drink!

359
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:16,720
Your aunt's wine is good!

360
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,597
Cheers!

361
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,103
Drink up, tianqing!

362
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,481
Offer some wishes to your brother.

363
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,612
Tianbai...

364
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,200
My...

365
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,498
My good brother...

366
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,500
Tianqing is drunk!

367
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:58,512
Tianqing would like
a son of his own.

368
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,514
Be patient...

369
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,100
Your uncle will spend some money...

370
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,395
And buy you an even prettier
wife.

371
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,897
Would you like that?

372
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,182
It's chili powder!

373
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,285
Use vinegar.

374
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,704
Vinegar?

375
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,582
Does that work?

376
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,457
Yes, it works.

377
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,712
Old people use vinegar
as a cure.

378
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:26,725
I can't take any more!

379
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,604
I really can't take any more.

380
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,734
Let's find a way.

381
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:45,493
Let's take tianbai and leave.

382
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:56,463
Or let's live together and
never mind what people might say.

383
01:01:58,256 --> 01:01:59,633
What they'd say doesn't worry me.

384
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,470
If they knew, they'd kill us!

385
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,141
You worry and worry...
Just find us a solution!

386
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,296
What's that?

387
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,298
Arsenic.

388
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,301
From where? What for?

389
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,517
Ju do...

390
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:54,770
Stop and think, will you?

391
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,896
I have!

392
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,897
Give it to me.

393
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,402
Listen to me.

394
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,778
It's either him or me!

395
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,780
Him? Who?

396
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:06,700
Don't you know?

397
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:22,048
How dare you?
After all, he is my uncle.

398
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:33,727
He's your uncle...
And I, what am I?

399
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,107
What am I to you?

400
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,194
Answer me, go on, say it!
— ju dou!

401
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:35,663
Hear the bell, ding, dong!

402
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:40,543
Here we are at village wang!

403
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:45,548
So many dogs... here they come!

404
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:49,427
They bite us all...
But we can't run!

405
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,640
We can't run so we go home!

406
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:59,312
Play the horn just for fun!

407
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,089
What's wrong?

408
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,717
Your aunt's lower parts
are in bad shape.

409
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,722
Is your paralyzed uncle strong
enough to have done that?

410
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,729
Give her this medicine.

411
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,731
But, frankly speaking...

412
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,733
She can never...

413
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,237
Become pregnant again.

414
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:53,241
At least it's one less thing
to worry about.

415
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,631
You go first.

416
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,010
I'll come home after dark.

417
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,405
Ju dou, don't do anything silly.

418
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,418
Tianbai, my son...

419
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:49,422
Do you want to dye the straw?

420
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,763
I'll help you.

421
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,432
We'll dye it bright red.

422
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,754
You did it?

423
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:54,880
Did what?

424
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,134
You know very well!

425
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,388
Stop talking nonsense!

426
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,767
When I came home,
he was already floating.

427
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,352
Don't lie to me!

428
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,397
You should have let me do it.

429
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:16,736
Killing one's husband
cries out for punishment.

430
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:18,780
You're accusing me wrongly!

431
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,407
I'm lost in any case.

432
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,620
Where is the little bottle?

433
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,039
Where is the bottle?

434
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,044
You threw it out? Where?

435
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,172
Where??

436
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:39,759
Here.

437
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,761
You still have it?

438
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:45,056
Keepit

439
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:50,268
I'm involved, too.

440
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,187
What are you trying to prove?

441
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,773
Look at yourself!

442
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,151
Is that a son's loyalty?

443
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,279
Didn't he deserve to die?

444
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,782
Are you sorry he's dead?

445
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,327
You'd rather keep on being
tianbai's brother!

446
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,707
What a good, respectful nephew!

447
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:21,718
Tianqing!

448
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:25,596
You, too, are beating me?

449
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,101
Sure, continue doing it!

450
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,103
Revive the old man,

451
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:35,981
and you can both beat me!

452
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:38,109
I don't want to live any more.

453
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:05,343
According to tradition...

454
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:09,264
Tianbai is the only Yang heir
in the tian generation.

455
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,268
Tianqing isn't really
part of the family.

456
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,730
According to ancient custom...

457
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:20,275
The funeral will
take place tomorrow.

458
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:25,406
Out of loyalty, ju dou and tianqing
will block the coffin's path.

459
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:30,745
There is gossip about them
in the village.

460
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:36,167
Tomorrow the entire Yang family

461
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,669
will see with its own eyes...

462
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,548
Whether they are truly loyal.

463
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,676
According to ancestral tradition...

464
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:50,681
Ju dou will not remarry.

465
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,685
The widow will remain faithful.

466
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:00,774
After the ceremony... tianqing
will move out of the dye mill.

467
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:02,693
He will sleep at wang's house.

468
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:08,448
A man living in a house with a
widow, even though she's his aunt...

469
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,785
Would cause gossip
about the Yang family...

470
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:19,085
Whose reputation is unblemished.

471
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,732
Are they blocking the path?

472
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,359
They're waiting up ahead.

473
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:48,738
According to custom, they must
block the path 49 times.

474
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,117
There must be no mistake.

475
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:04,463
Block the path!

476
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:08,758
Uncle,

477
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:09,885
don't leave!

478
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:13,389
Don't leave!

479
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:22,015
Don't leave!

480
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:26,777
Don't leave!

481
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,991
Don't leave!

482
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,244
That's once!

483
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:44,245
Don't leave!

484
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,062
Don't leave!

485
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,522
Don't leave!

486
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,815
That's twice!

487
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,776
Uncle,

488
01:14:06,777 --> 01:14:11,447
don't leave!

489
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:21,659
Tianbai!

490
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,709
Aunt!

491
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:52,566
What is it?

492
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:59,740
I bought this at the market
a few days ago.

493
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,708
That's for tianbai.

494
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,210
Give it to him.

495
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:14,755
No, you do it.
He won't talk to me.

496
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:19,760
Look.

497
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:33,774
Isn't it too bright?

498
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,778
You're still very beautiful.

499
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,546
Your brother bought this for you.

500
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,764
Aunt... I'm leaving now.

501
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,058
Look the door.

502
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,730
Tianbai,

503
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,982
I'm going to shi village.

504
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,736
Your sixth uncle asked for me.

505
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,379
Let's stop coming here.

506
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,341
Someone might see us.

507
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:27,137
It will be getting cold.
Where could we go?

508
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,642
You should get home.

509
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,771
People gossip about widows.

510
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:50,743
Since the old man's death,
we live in fear of gossip.

511
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:53,163
You moved away
seven or eight years ago.

512
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,542
We're always hiding.

513
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:00,296
Tianqing!

514
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:04,758
Let's take tianbai
and leave this place.

515
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:07,052
Don't say that.

516
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:12,557
The worst part is behind us.

517
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:16,185
Later on tianbai will
take over the dye mill.

518
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:19,440
Then I'll tell him
the whole truth.

519
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,066
Youwe crazyl

520
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,279
you'll tell him?!
Do you want to lose him?

521
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:30,784
If we don't tell him
he'll keep on hating us...

522
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:35,080
And acting as if
he wanted us dead.

523
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:40,586
It looked like two deer
or two foxes.

524
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,212
Then I saw it was two people.

525
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:44,715
I couldn't see
who was underneath...

526
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,717
But on top was...

527
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,219
Who?

528
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,721
Tianbai's mother.

529
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:52,723
That widow?

530
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,558
She was on top?

531
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,104
She was moving like
when they scrub laundry.

532
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:03,484
Where was that?

533
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:04,735
It was...

534
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,746
Murdererl... murderer!

535
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:35,349
Murdererl... murderer!

536
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,145
Murdererl... no!

537
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:58,747
What's wrong?

538
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,668
Let's see your hand.

539
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,503
You're bleeding!

540
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,507
Let me suck out the wound.

541
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,177
Let me...

542
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,708
You evil brat!

543
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:47,463
Tianbai, now listen carefully!

544
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,340
You have hit your father!

545
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,719
I'm telling you this today:

546
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:58,223
You are the son of Yang tianqing.
He is your father!

547
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,058
Aunt!

548
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:34,319
Here's your lunch. Go on, eat.

549
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:39,533
Where's tianbai?

550
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,784
He went out.

551
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:21,241
Life will be even harder for us.

552
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,747
I'm getting older... but...

553
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,378
I'd like to sleep with you.

554
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:41,011
If you wish...
Let's find a place.

555
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,434
It's stifling, isn't it?

556
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,436
I'm out of breath.

557
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:36,774
There's not much air
in this cave.

558
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,777
There's no air at all.

559
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:40,779
If we stay here,

560
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:43,782
we'll suffocate.

561
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,161
Should we leave?

562
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,455
Let's stay this way.

563
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:52,708
Let's keep lying here...

564
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:57,295
For the rest of our lives.

565
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,719
We're old.

566
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:12,728
Do you remember how it all began
for us?

567
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,733
Yes.

568
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:25,365
Tell me, go on.

569
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:29,744
Tell me.

570
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,621
No, you tell me.

571
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:34,750
It makes me blush.

572
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,756
Remember, I watched you
through a hole in the wall.

573
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:46,261
Yes. I remember.

574
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:53,643
And now we've gone into
this large hole.

575
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,214
Tianqing.

576
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:06,716
Tianqing.

577
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:11,721
Tianqing. Tianqing...

578
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:19,364
Tianqing! Tianqing!

579
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:24,752
Tianqing! Tianqing!

580
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,296
Tianqing!

581
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:28,673
Tianqing!

582
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:07,082
Hear the bell, ding dong.

583
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:11,169
Here we are at village wang.

584
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:15,589
They attack us but we can't run!

585
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:19,468
They bite us all...
But we can't run!

586
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:23,472
We can't run, so we go home.

587
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:28,477
Play the horn just for fun.

588
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:32,357
Hear the bell, ding dong.

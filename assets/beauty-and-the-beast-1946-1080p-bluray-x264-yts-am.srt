1
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:48,119
Once upon a time
in a faraway land

2
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,789
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

3
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:55,293
Although he had
everything his heart desired

4
00:00:55,334 --> 00:01:00,214
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,508
But then, one winter's night

6
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,677
an old beggar woman
came to the castle

7
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:08,221
and offered him a single rose

8
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:11,849
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

9
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:14,435
Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

10
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:19,148
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,151
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

12
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:25,195
for beauty is found within

13
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,656
and when he dismissed her again

14
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,575
the old woman's ugliness
melted away

15
00:01:30,617 --> 00:01:33,202
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

16
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:36,664
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

17
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:40,209
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

18
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:42,836
and as punishment,
she transformed him

19
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,338
into a hideous beast

20
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,549
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

21
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:49,426
and all who lived there.

22
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,761
Ashamed of his monstrous form

23
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:55,181
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

24
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:58,184
with a magic mirror
as his only window

25
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,810
to the outside world.

26
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:04,773
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

27
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:08,360
which would bloom
until his 21st year.

28
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,154
lf he could learn
to love another

29
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:16,117
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,078
then the spell would be broken.

31
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:24,374
lf not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

32
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:30,338
As the years passed,
he fell into despair

33
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,341
and lost all hope

34
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:37,386
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

35
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:08,248
Little town,
it's a quiet village

36
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,877
Every day lile the one before

37
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,214
Little town,
full of little people

38
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:22,594
Waking up... to... say...

39
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,512
Bonjour!

40
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:24,346
- Bonjour!

41
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:25,305
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

42
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:25,889
Bonjour!

43
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,515
There goes the baker

44
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:30,310
With his tray like always

45
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:33,396
The same old bread
and rolls to sell

46
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,231
Every morning just the same

47
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,691
Since the morning that we came

48
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:38,359
To this poor provincial town...

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,360
Good morning, Belle.

50
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,319
Good morning, Monsieur.

51
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,320
Where are you off to?

52
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:42,237
The bookshop.

53
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,406
l just finished
the most wonderful story

54
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,241
about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...

55
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:47,367
That's nice.

56
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,618
Marie! The baguettes.

57
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,078
Hurry up!

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,037
Look, there she goes

59
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,456
The girl is strange, no question

60
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:56,751
Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell?

61
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,544
Never part of any crowd

62
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:00,337
'Cause her head's
up on some cloud

63
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,174
No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle

64
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:05,300
Bonjour

65
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:06,259
Good day

66
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:07,969
How is your family?

67
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:08,928
Bonjour

68
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,888
Good day

69
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,723
How is your wife?

70
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,558
l need six eggs

71
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,017
That's too expensive

72
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,146
There must be more
than this provincial life...

73
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,606
Ah, Belle.

74
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:21,607
Good morning.

75
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,400
l've come to return
the book l borrowed.

76
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,359
Finished already?

77
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,652
Oh, l couldn't put it down.

78
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,571
Have you got anything new?

79
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:28,697
Not since yesterday.

80
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:29,989
That's all right.

81
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:31,950
l'll borrow... this one.

82
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:32,992
That one?

83
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,410
But you've read it twice.

84
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:36,579
Well, it's my favorite--
far-off places

85
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,913
daring sword fights

86
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:39,748
magic spells,
a prince in disguise.

87
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,793
lf you like it
all that much, it's yours.

88
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,795
-But, sir...
-l insist.

89
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:45,754
Well, thank you.

90
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,005
Thank you very much.

91
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,548
Look, there she goes

92
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,050
That girl is so peculiar

93
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:54,262
l wonder if she's feeling well

94
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:56,013
With a dreamy, far-off look

95
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,681
And her nose stuck in a book

96
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:01,643
What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle

97
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:07,399
Oh, isn't this amazing?

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:16,407
lt's my favorite part
because you'll see

99
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:22,371
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming

100
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:25,999
But she won't discover
that it's him

101
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,294
Till Chapter Three

102
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:31,254
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:34,674
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

104
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:37,760
Her looks have got no parallel

105
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:39,595
But behind that fair facade

106
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:41,638
l'm afraid she's rather odd

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,557
Very different
from the rest of us

108
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,350
She's nothing like
the rest of us

109
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,104
Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle

110
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,568
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

111
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,610
You're the greatest hunter

112
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:57,820
in the whole world.

113
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,405
l know.

114
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,323
No beast alive
stands a chance against you

115
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,200
and no girl, for that matter.

116
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:04,159
lt's true, Lefou

117
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:06,536
and l've got my sights set
on that one.

118
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,204
The inventor's daughter?

119
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,915
She's the one-- the lucky girl
l'm going to marry.

120
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:11,958
But, she...

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,292
The most beautiful girl in town.

122
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,418
l know, but...

123
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,128
That makes her the best

124
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,755
and don't l deserve the best?

125
00:06:17,797 --> 00:06:18,797
Well, of course.

126
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:20,007
l mean, you do, but...

127
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:23,135
Right from the moment
when l met her, saw her

128
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:23,260
l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell

129
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,888
l said, ''She's gorgeous,''
and l fell

130
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,767
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me

131
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:34,687
So, l'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

132
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,441
Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy?

133
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,443
Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute

134
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,988
Be still, my heart,
l'm hardly breathing

135
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,366
He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute

136
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,618
-Bonjour -Pardon
-Good day -Mais oui

137
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
-You call this bacon?
-What lovely grapes

138
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,205
-Ten yards -Some cheese
-'Scuse me -One pound

139
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,164
l'll get the knife

140
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,123
Please let me through

141
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,166
-This bread -Those fish

142
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,125
-lt's stale -They smell

143
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,084
Madame's mistaken

144
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,294
There must be more

145
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,838
Than this provincial life

146
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:06,383
Just watch, l'm going
to make Belle my wife

147
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,384
Look, there she goes

148
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,969
A girl who's strange
but special

149
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,181
A most peculiar mademoiselle

150
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:14,682
lt's a pity and a sin

151
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,392
She doesn't quite fit in

152
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:18,102
'Cause she really is
a funny girl

153
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:20,312
A beauty but a funny girl

154
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:25,150
She really is a funny girl

155
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:28,194
That Belle...

156
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:31,114
Bonjour, bonjour.

157
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:35,368
Hello, Belle.

158
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,994
Bonjour, Gaston.

159
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,079
Gaston,
may l have my book, please?

160
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,205
How can you read this?

161
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,331
There's no pictures.

162
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,333
Well, some people
use their imagination.

163
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,377
Belle, it's about time
you got your head

164
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,336
out of those books

165
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,005
and paid attention
to more important things...

166
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,006
like me.

167
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,302
The whole town's
talking about it.

168
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,262
lt's not right
for a woman to read.

169
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:58,973
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

170
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,432
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

171
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:01,600
Why, thank you, Belle.

172
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:04,603
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

173
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:06,229
and take a look at my trophies?

174
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:07,981
Maybe some other time.

175
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,107
What's wrong with her?

176
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,066
She's crazy.

177
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,609
He's gorgeous.

178
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:12,985
Please, Gaston, l can't.

179
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:15,071
l have to get home
to help my father.

180
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,072
Good-bye.

181
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,573
That crazy old loon--

182
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,909
he needs all the
help he can get.

183
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:22,453
Don't talk about my father
that way.

184
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,038
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

185
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,456
My father is not crazy.

186
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:27,457
He's a genius.

187
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,295
Ooh!

188
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,845
Papa?

189
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:44,222
How on earth did that happen?

190
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:45,682
Doggone it!

191
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,475
Are you all right, Papa?

192
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:51,104
l'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

193
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,897
You always say that.

194
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:54,023
l mean it this time.

195
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:54,941
l'll never get

196
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:57,234
this boneheaded contraption
to work!

197
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:58,360
Yes, you will

198
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,654
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

199
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,572
Humph!

200
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,449
And become
a world-famous inventor.

201
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,368
You really believe that?

202
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,827
l always have.

203
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,871
Well, what are we waiting for?

204
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:12,457
l'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

205
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:13,833
Hand me that, uh...

206
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,543
dog-legged clincher, there.

207
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:18,254
So, did you have a
good time in town today?

208
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,297
l got a new book.

209
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,592
Papa, do you think l'm odd?

210
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:24,843
My daughter? Odd?

211
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:27,679
Where would you get
an idea like that?

212
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,763
Oh, l don't know.

213
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:31,516
lt's just that l'm not sure
l fit in here.

214
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:33,935
There's no one
l can really talk to.

215
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,645
What about that Gaston?

216
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:37,313
He's a handsome fellow.

217
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:40,983
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

218
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,734
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

219
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:44,069
Well, don't you worry

220
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,947
'cause this invention's
going to be the start

221
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:48,365
of a new life for us.

222
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:49,824
l think that's done it.

223
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,576
Now, let's give it a try.

224
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,548
lt works!

225
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,800
lt does?

226
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:09,968
lt does!

227
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:10,927
You did it!

228
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,136
You really did it!

229
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,888
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

230
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,598
l'm off to the fair!

231
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,726
Good-bye, Papa.

232
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,060
Good luck.

233
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:23,105
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while l'm gone.

234
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:41,288
We should be there by now.

235
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,206
We should be there by now.

236
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:44,374
Maybe we've missed the turn.

237
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,251
l guess l should have taken...

238
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:47,627
Wait a minute.

239
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,758
Let's go this way.

240
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,977
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

241
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,479
We'll be there in no time.

242
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,038
This can't be right.

243
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,582
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

244
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:32,293
We'd better turn around.

245
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,129
Whoa...

246
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:37,465
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

247
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:40,342
Oh...!

248
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:41,927
Oh, look out!

249
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,265
Whoa!

250
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,184
Whoa, boy!

251
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,936
Back up, back up, back up!

252
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,938
Good boy, good boy.

253
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,981
That's it.

254
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:56,023
Back up!

255
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:57,650
Steady, steady.

256
00:11:57,691 --> 00:11:58,943
Now, steady.

257
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,779
Philippe, no!

258
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:09,786
Philippe.

259
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,248
Oh...

260
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,394
Help!

261
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,646
ls someone there?!

262
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,819
Oh!

263
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:07,339
What...?

264
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,300
Oh...

265
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:15,805
Hello?

266
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,266
Hello?

267
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:22,561
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

268
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,688
Keep quiet; maybe he'll go away.

269
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,940
ls someone there?

270
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:30,527
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

271
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,322
l don't mean to intrude,
but l've lost my horse

272
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:37,533
and l need a place to stay
for the night.

273
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,493
Oh, Cogsworth, have a heart.

274
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,161
Shh!

275
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,665
Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

276
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:47,167
Who said that?

277
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,127
Over here.

278
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:50,336
Where?

279
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:51,212
Allo.

280
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,258
lncredible.

281
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,886
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

282
00:13:58,928 --> 00:14:00,888
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

283
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,306
How is this accomplished?

284
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,515
Put me down at once!

285
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:04,725
Stop that!

286
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:08,687
Stop that, l say.

287
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:09,646
Ow!

288
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,484
Huh... Close that at once.

289
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:15,943
Do you mind?!

290
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:17,319
l-l beg your pardon.

291
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:20,197
lt's, it's just
that l've never seen a...

292
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,915
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.

293
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,042
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

294
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:34,001
Thank you.

295
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:35,044
No, no, no.

296
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:38,422
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

297
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:42,050
l demand
that you stop right there.

298
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,218
Oh, no, no!

299
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,137
Not the master's chair.

300
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:47,889
l'm not seeing this!

301
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,099
l am not seeing this!

302
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,519
Well, hello there, boy.

303
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,691
What service.

304
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,402
All right,
this has gone far enough.

305
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,903
l'm in charge here.

306
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,155
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

307
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,698
lt'll warm you up
in no time.

308
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,658
No. No tea.

309
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,909
No tea!

310
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,038
His mustache tickles, Mama.

311
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,957
Oh!

312
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,124
Hello.

313
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,797
Uh-oh.

314
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh...

315
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,221
Ah...

316
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,140
There's a stranger here.

317
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:35,641
Master, allow me to explain.

318
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:37,518
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

319
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,727
He was cold and wet...

320
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,023
Master, l'd like
to take this moment to say

321
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,941
l was against this
from the start.

322
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:46,151
lt was all his fault.

323
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:49,237
l tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

324
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:56,035
Who are you?

325
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:57,203
What are you doing here?

326
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,622
l-l-l was lost in the woods,
and, and...

327
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:00,539
You're not welcome here!

328
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:03,584
l-l-l'm sorry.

329
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,710
What are you staring at?!

330
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,710
N-Nothing.

331
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:09,297
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?!

332
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:10,590
Please, l meant no harm!

333
00:16:10,632 --> 00:16:12,425
l just needed a place to stay.

334
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,260
l'll give you a place to stay.

335
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:15,386
Oh, no...!

336
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:17,388
Please! Oh, no!

337
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:24,853
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

338
00:16:24,895 --> 00:16:26,229
huh, Gaston?

339
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:28,773
Yep. This is her lucky day.

340
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:34,987
l'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

341
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:38,407
But first l'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

342
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:43,537
And you, Lefou-- now, when Belle
and l come out that door...

343
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:44,496
Oh, l know, l know!

344
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:45,872
l-l strike up the band.

345
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,293
Not yet!

346
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:51,920
Sorry.

347
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,972
Gaston.

348
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,682
What a pleasant surprise.

349
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,975
lsn't it, though?

350
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,060
l'm just full of surprises.

351
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,145
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

352
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,064
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

353
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,191
This is the day...

354
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,609
Hmm.

355
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:17,818
Yeah.

356
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,736
This is the day your
dreams come true.

357
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:19,987
This is the day your
dreams come true.

358
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,198
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

359
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:26,576
Plenty. Here, picture this:

360
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,578
A rustic hunting lodge

361
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,581
my latest kill
roasting on the fire

362
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,625
and my little wife,
massaging my feet

363
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,628
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.

364
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,796
We'll have six or seven.

365
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:39,672
Dogs?

366
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,631
No, Belle!

367
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:41,757
Strapping boys, like me.

368
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,716
lmagine that.

369
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:43,675
And do you know

370
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,218
who that little wife will be?

371
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,178
Let me think.

372
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:47,178
You, Belle.

373
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,305
Gaston, l'm...

374
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,556
l'm...

375
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:50,849
speechless.

376
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,309
l really don't know what to say.

377
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:54,268
Say you'll marry me.

378
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:57,354
l'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

379
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:59,607
but... l just don't deserve you.

380
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,316
Whoa!

381
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:17,206
So, how'd it go?

382
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:20,459
l'll have Belle for my wife.

383
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,170
Make no mistake about that!

384
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,130
Touchy.

385
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,514
ls he gone?

386
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,932
Can you imagine?

387
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:38,726
He asked me to marry him.

388
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:42,146
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

389
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,815
Madame Gaston

390
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,399
Can't you just see it?

391
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,817
Madame Gaston

392
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,278
His little wife

393
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,780
No, sir, not me

394
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,115
l guarantee it

395
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:57,660
l want much more
than this provincial life

396
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:11,130
l want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere

397
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:14,675
l want it more than l can tell

398
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:19,388
And for once it might be grand

399
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,683
To have someone understand

400
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:29,606
l want so much more
than they've got planned.

401
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,068
Philippe!
What are you doing here?

402
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,444
Where's...?

403
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,570
Where's Papa?

404
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:37,905
Where is he, Philippe?

405
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,114
What happened?

406
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:40,491
Oh, we have to find him.

407
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:43,160
You have to take me to him.

408
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:56,964
What is this place?

409
00:19:58,883 --> 00:19:59,842
Philippe, please!

410
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:00,884
Steady!

411
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,679
Steady.

412
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,850
Papa.

413
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,644
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

414
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:13,896
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

415
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:15,398
Serve him tea.

416
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,941
Sit in the master's chair.

417
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,275
Pet the pooch.

418
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,110
l was trying
to be hospitable.

419
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,613
Hello?

420
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,365
ls anyone here?

421
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:28,910
Hello? Papa?

422
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,995
Papa?

423
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:33,081
Are you here?

424
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:36,000
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,253
Now, Chip, l'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

426
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,713
Really, Mama. l saw her.

427
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:41,630
Not another word.

428
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:42,589
But...

429
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,548
lnto the tub.

430
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,549
Woop...

431
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,468
Well! l saw a girl
in the castle!

432
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,054
See? l told you.

433
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:52,890
lrresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

434
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,975
Papa?

435
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:56,602
Did you see that?

436
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:00,397
lt's a girl!

437
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,690
l know it's a girl.

438
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:02,566
Don't you see?

439
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:03,734
She's the one--

440
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:05,360
the girl we have
been waiting for.

441
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:06,736
She has come to break the spell!

442
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,029
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

443
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:12,992
Papa?

444
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:15,536
Papa?

445
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:18,497
Hello?

446
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,374
ls someone here?

447
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,667
Wait!

448
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,627
l'm looking for my father. l...

449
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,130
That's funny.

450
00:21:27,172 --> 00:21:30,967
l'm sure there was someone.

451
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,427
l-ls anyone here?

452
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:33,678
Belle?

453
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,596
Papa!

454
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,140
H-How did you find me?

455
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:39,683
Oh, your hands are like ice.

456
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:41,560
l have to get you out of there.

457
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,729
Belle, l want you
to leave this place.

458
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,813
Who's done this to you?

459
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,148
No time to explain.

460
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:47,148
You must go! Now!

461
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,149
l won't leave you!

462
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:49,651
What are you doing here?

463
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:50,568
Run, Belle!

464
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,153
Who's there?
Who are you?

465
00:21:52,153 --> 00:21:53,905
The master of this castle.

466
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:56,324
l've come for my father.

467
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:57,783
Please let him out.

468
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,951
Can't you see he's sick?

469
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,994
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

470
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:02,579
But he could die.

471
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,830
Please, l-l'll do anything.

472
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:06,374
There's nothing you can do.

473
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,459
He's my prisoner.

474
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,919
Oh, there must be
some way l can...

475
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,004
Wait!

476
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:18,010
Take me instead.

477
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:20,721
You?!

478
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:22,681
You would...

479
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:24,099
take his place?

480
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,058
Belle, no!

481
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:27,018
You don't know
what you're doing!

482
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,145
lf l did,
would you let him go?

483
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:33,608
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

484
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,236
Come into the light.

485
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:49,664
No, Belle!

486
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,750
l won't let you do this!

487
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,294
You have my word.

488
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:57,254
Done!

489
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,009
No, Belle, listen to me.

490
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,552
l'm old. l've lived my life.

491
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:04,553
Wait.

492
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:05,262
Belle!

493
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:05,971
Wait!

494
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:08,598
No, please spare my daughter.

495
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,724
Please!

496
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:12,143
She's no longer your concern.

497
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:13,478
Take him to the village.

498
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,437
Let me out!

499
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,646
Please let me out!

500
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:17,398
Let me out!

501
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,025
Please! Oh, please!

502
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:25,989
Master?

503
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:26,990
What?

504
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,367
Since the girl is going
to be with us

505
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,660
for quite some time

506
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,663
l was thinking that you
might want to offer her

507
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,289
a more comfortable room.

508
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,584
Then again, maybe not.

509
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,880
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

510
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,882
l'll never see him again.

511
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,927
l didn't get to say good-bye.

512
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,678
l'll show you to your room.

513
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,055
My room?

514
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:53,431
But l thought...

515
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,474
You want to stay in the tower?

516
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:56,183
No.

517
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:57,309
Then follow me.

518
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:19,246
Say something to her.

519
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,206
Huh? Oh.

520
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,626
l, uh, hope you like it here.

521
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:29,547
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

522
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:30,882
except the west wing.

523
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:31,716
What's in the west...?

524
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,634
lt's forbidden!

525
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:41,475
Now, if you need anything

526
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:43,435
my servants will attend you.

527
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:44,853
Dinner.
lnvite her to dinner.

528
00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:47,564
You will join me for dinner.

529
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,691
That's not a request!

530
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,708
Who does she think she is?

531
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,586
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

532
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:13,504
No one says no to Gaston.

533
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:14,547
Darn right.

534
00:25:14,589 --> 00:25:16,757
Dismissed, rejected...

535
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,259
publicly humiliated.

536
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,511
Why, it's more than l can bear.

537
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,553
More beer?

538
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:22,471
What for?

539
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:23,764
Nothing helps.

540
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:25,015
l'm disgraced.

541
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,224
Who, you?

542
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,017
Never!

543
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:31,271
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

544
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:34,065
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

545
00:25:34,106 --> 00:25:35,900
Looking so down in the dumps

546
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:40,404
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

547
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:43,657
Even when taking your lumps

548
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:46,451
There's no man in town
as admired as you

549
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:50,079
You're everyone's favorite guy

550
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:52,915
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you

551
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:59,672
And it's not very hard
to see why

552
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,301
No... one's...

553
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,677
Slick as Gaston

554
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,554
No one's quick as Gaston

555
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:10,765
No one's neck's
as incredibly thick as Gaston

556
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:14,393
For there's no man in town
half as manly

557
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:16,812
Perfect, a pure paragon

558
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:20,149
You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley

559
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,650
And they'll tell you whose team

560
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:24,194
They prefer to be on

561
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:25,195
Ooh!

562
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:29,282
No... one's...
been like Gaston

563
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:30,867
A kingpin like Gaston

564
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:32,785
No one's got a full cleft

565
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,328
ln his chin like Gaston

566
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,957
As a specimen, yes,
l'm intimidating

567
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:41,001
My, what a guy, that Gaston

568
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,461
Give five ''hurrahs!''

569
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:44,212
Give 12 ''hip-hips!''

570
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:48,842
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

571
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:52,261
No... one...

572
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:53,638
Fights like Gaston

573
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,348
Douses lights like Gaston

574
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:58,517
ln a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston

575
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,645
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

576
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,898
As you see,
l've got biceps to spare

577
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,359
Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny

578
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,693
That's right

579
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:11,821
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair

580
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,156
No one hits like Gaston

581
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:14,574
Matches wits like Gaston

582
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:18,536
ln a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston

583
00:27:18,577 --> 00:27:20,829
l'm especially good
at expectorating

584
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:21,747
Ptooey!

585
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:24,666
Ten points for Gaston!

586
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,042
When l was a lad

587
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:27,961
l ate four dozen eggs

588
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:30,964
Every morning
to help me get large

589
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:32,298
And now that l'm grown

590
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,050
l eat five dozen eggs

591
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:39,763
So l'm roughly
the size of a barge

592
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:42,933
No... one...

593
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,393
Shoots like Gaston

594
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,311
Makes those beauts like Gaston

595
00:27:46,353 --> 00:27:49,064
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

596
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:53,151
l use antlers
in all of my decorating

597
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:55,486
My, what a guy

598
00:27:55,528 --> 00:28:00,616
Gaston!

599
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:05,370
Help!

600
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,288
Help!

601
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:07,122
Someone help me!

602
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,039
Maurice?

603
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:08,540
Please, please!

604
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:09,749
l need your help.

605
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,875
He's got her...

606
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,502
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

607
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:13,461
Who?

608
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:14,420
Belle. We must go.

609
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:16,380
N-Not a minute to lose.

610
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:17,423
Whoa!

611
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:18,716
Slow down, Maurice.

612
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:20,634
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

613
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:21,969
A beast!

614
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,513
A horrible, monstrous beast.

615
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,059
ls it a big beast?

616
00:28:30,101 --> 00:28:31,060
Huge!

617
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,520
With a long ugly snout?

618
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,646
Hideously ugly.

619
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:35,231
And sharp, cruel fangs?

620
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:36,273
Yes, yes.

621
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:37,733
Will you help me?

622
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:38,776
All right, old man.

623
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,110
We'll help you out.

624
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,070
You will?

625
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:41,987
Oh, thank you.

626
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,864
Thank you.
Thank you!

627
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:44,072
Oh!

628
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,782
Oh!

629
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,743
Crazy old Maurice.

630
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,745
He's always good for a laugh.

631
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:54,665
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

632
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:58,502
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

633
00:28:58,544 --> 00:29:02,422
Lefou, l'm afraid
l've been thinking

634
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:03,757
A dangerous pastime...

635
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,675
l know

636
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,219
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

637
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:10,889
And his sanity's only so-so

638
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,892
Now the wheels in my head
have been turning

639
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:17,603
Since l looked
at that loony old man

640
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:19,438
See, l promised myself

641
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,565
l'd be married to Belle

642
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:25,402
And right now,
l'm evolving a plan

643
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:27,362
lf l...

644
00:29:27,404 --> 00:29:28,363
Yes?

645
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:29,364
Then we...

646
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:30,365
No! Would she...?

647
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:31,241
Guess!

648
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:32,283
Now l get it!

649
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,076
Let's go!

650
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:36,954
No... one...

651
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:38,539
Plots like Gaston

652
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:40,374
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

653
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:43,335
Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston

654
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:48,673
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

655
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:51,092
My, what a guy!

656
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:55,137
Gaston!

657
00:29:57,723 --> 00:30:01,477
Will no one help me?

658
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,443
Who is it?

659
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:11,736
Mrs. Potts, dear.

660
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:15,656
l thought you might
like a spot of tea.

661
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,575
But you're... you're a...

662
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,868
Ooh!

663
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:19,827
Careful.

664
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:20,744
This is impossible.

665
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,246
l know it is.

666
00:30:22,246 --> 00:30:24,039
But here we are.

667
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:26,625
l told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't l?

668
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,960
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

669
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:30,003
Slowly now.

670
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:31,462
Don't spill.

671
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:33,047
Thank you.

672
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:35,549
Want to see me do a trick?

673
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:37,885
Chip!

674
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:39,845
Oops. Sorry.

675
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:42,347
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

676
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,016
We all think so.

677
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:47,435
But l've lost my father,
my dreams... everything.

678
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:48,937
Cheer up, child.

679
00:30:48,978 --> 00:30:52,273
lt'll turn out
all right in the end.

680
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:53,483
You'll see.

681
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:54,567
Oh, listen to me.

682
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:56,027
Jabbering on while
there's a supper

683
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,028
to get on the table.

684
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:58,946
Chip!

685
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:00,239
Bye.

686
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,783
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

687
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:05,243
Oh, let's see what l got
in my drawers.

688
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:07,704
Ooh! How embarrassing.

689
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:11,374
Ah, here we are.

690
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,085
You'll look ravishing
in this one.

691
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:17,004
That's very kind of you, but...
l'm not going to dinner.

692
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:19,757
Oh, but you must.

693
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:24,886
Dinner is served.

694
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:28,473
What's taking so long?

695
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:30,350
l told her to come down.

696
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:31,601
Why isn't she here yet?

697
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:33,311
Oh, try to be patient, sir.

698
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:37,148
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom, all in one day.

699
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:38,440
Master, have you thought

700
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,360
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

701
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:42,736
Of course l have.

702
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,071
l'm not a fool.

703
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,363
Good!

704
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,074
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

705
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,285
and poof! the spell is broken.

706
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,203
We'll be human again
by midnight.

707
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,996
Ooh, it's not that easy,
Lumiere.

708
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,248
These things take time.

709
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,249
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

710
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,209
Oh, it's no use.

711
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,920
She's so beautiful, and l'm...

712
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:02,963
Well, look at me!

713
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,009
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

714
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,385
l don't know how.

715
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,720
Well, you can start

716
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,305
by making yourself
more presentable.

717
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,473
Straighten up.

718
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,141
Try to act like a gentleman.

719
00:32:15,182 --> 00:32:16,559
Ah, yes.
When she comes in

720
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,435
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

721
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,145
Come, come,
show me the smile.

722
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:22,981
But don't frighten
the poor girl.

723
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,649
lmpress her
with your rapier wit.

724
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:26,568
But be gentle.

725
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:28,028
Shower her
with compliments.

726
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:29,028
But be sincere.

727
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,988
And above all...

728
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,865
You must control your temper!

729
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,617
Here she is!

730
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,453
Good evening.

731
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:40,414
Well, where is she?

732
00:32:40,456 --> 00:32:42,457
Who? Oh.

733
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:43,875
The girl, yes.

734
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,043
The... girl.

735
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:48,129
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

736
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:51,716
Circumstances being
what they are...

737
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:53,217
She's not coming.

738
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:55,344
What?!

739
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:56,679
But, Your Grace...!

740
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,847
Your Eminence!

741
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:05,020
l thought l told you
to come down to dinner!

742
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:06,354
l'm not hungry.

743
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:08,273
You come out, or l'll...

744
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:10,024
l'll... l'll break down
the door!

745
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:11,192
Master...

746
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:13,611
l could be wrong,
but that may not be

747
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:16,489
the best way
to win the girl's affections.

748
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,908
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

749
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,661
But she is being so difficult.

750
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,204
Gently, gently.

751
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:27,832
Will you come down to dinner?

752
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:29,000
No.

753
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,251
Hmm?

754
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:31,336
Ah, ah, ah!

755
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,628
Suave, genteel.

756
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:38,551
lt would give me great pleasure
if you would join me for dinner.

757
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:39,718
We say please.

758
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,220
Please.

759
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:42,012
No, thank you!

760
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,513
You can't stay in there forever!

761
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,806
Yes, l can.

762
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:48,435
Fine. Then go ahead and starve!

763
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:53,064
lf she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all.

764
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:57,359
Oh, dear.

765
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,986
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

766
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:01,738
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

767
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,615
and inform me at once

768
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:05,283
if there is
the slightest change.

769
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:07,160
You can count on me,
mon capitan.

770
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,537
Well, we might as well
go downstairs

771
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:12,415
and start cleaning up.

772
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:15,960
l ask nicely,
but she refuses.

773
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:18,629
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

774
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:20,756
Show me the girl.

775
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:25,302
Well, the master's
really not so bad

776
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:26,720
once you get to know him.

777
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,555
Why don't you give him a chance?

778
00:34:28,555 --> 00:34:30,140
l don't want to get to know him.

779
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,140
l don't want to have anything
to do with him!

780
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,892
l don't want to have anything
to do with him!

781
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:36,645
l'm just fooling myself.

782
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:39,607
She'll never see me
as anything...

783
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:42,234
but a monster.

784
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,448
lt's hopeless.

785
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,006
Oh, no!

786
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:07,132
Oh, yes!

787
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,133
Oh, no!

788
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:09,342
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

789
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:11,594
l've been burned by you before.

790
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:17,016
Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

791
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,439
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

792
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,191
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

793
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,984
But l'm not sleepy.

794
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,569
Yes, you are.

795
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:31,988
No, l'm not.

796
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,073
l work and l slave all day long
and for what?

797
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:37,034
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

798
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:38,285
Oh, stop your grousing.

799
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:40,245
lt's been a long night
for all of us.

800
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:43,040
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

801
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,791
After all, he did say please.

802
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,710
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

803
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,169
he'll never break...

804
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:49,921
Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.

805
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:53,800
l am Cogsworth,
head of the household.

806
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,969
This is Lumiere.

807
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,179
Enchante, cherie.

808
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:00,514
lf there's... Stop that!

809
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:02,015
...anything we... Please!

810
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:04,393
can do to make your
stay more comfortable.

811
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:05,435
Ow!

812
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:06,728
l am a little hungry.

813
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,687
You are?

814
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,314
Hear that? She's hungry.

815
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:10,315
Stoke the fire.

816
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:11,065
Break out the silver.

817
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,483
Wake the china.

818
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:14,944
Remember what the master said.

819
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:16,028
Oh, pishposh.

820
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,155
l'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

821
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:19,198
All right, fine.

822
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:21,075
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

823
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:23,493
Cogsworth,
l am surprised at you.

824
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:25,912
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

825
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:28,039
We must make her
feel welcome here.

826
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:29,707
Right this way,
Mademoiselle.

827
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:30,792
Well, keep it down.

828
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,710
lf the master finds out
about this

829
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:33,920
it will be our necks.

830
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,172
Of course, of course.

831
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,883
But what is dinner
without a little music?

832
00:36:38,924 --> 00:36:40,759
Music?

833
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:43,470
Ma chere
mademoiselle.

834
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:47,557
lt is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

835
00:36:47,557 --> 00:36:49,642
that we welcome you tonight.

836
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:50,852
And now we invite you to relax.

837
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:51,769
And now we invite you to relax.

838
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:53,354
Let us pull up a chair

839
00:36:53,396 --> 00:36:55,982
as the dining room
proudly presents...

840
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:57,942
your dinner.

841
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:02,112
Be... our... guest

842
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,530
Be our guest

843
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:06,449
Put our service to the test

844
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,243
Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie

845
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:10,787
And we provide the rest

846
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,206
Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres

847
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,041
Why, we only live to serve

848
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:16,459
Try the gray stuff

849
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,585
lt's delicious

850
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,753
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

851
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:21,880
They can sing, they can dance

852
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:24,174
After all, Miss, this is France

853
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:28,094
And a dinner here
is never second best

854
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:30,471
Go on, unfold your menu

855
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:32,557
Take a glance and then

856
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,558
You'll be our guest

857
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,767
Oui, our guest

858
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,686
Be our guest

859
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:38,979
Beef ragout, cheese souffle

860
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:40,939
Pie and pudding en flambe

861
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:42,941
We'll prepare and serve
with flair

862
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:45,026
A culinary cabaret

863
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,153
You're alone and you're scared

864
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,239
But the banquet's all prepared

865
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,074
No one's gloomy or complaining

866
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:53,117
While the flatware's
entertaining

867
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:55,328
We tell jokes, l do tricks

868
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,538
With my fellow candlesticks

869
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,500
And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet

870
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:03,585
Come on and lift your glass

871
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:05,128
You've won your own free pass

872
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,296
To be our guest--

873
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:07,714
lf you're stressed

874
00:38:07,756 --> 00:38:09,799
lt's fine dining we suggest--

875
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:12,135
Be our guest, be our guest

876
00:38:12,176 --> 00:38:13,886
Be our guest!

877
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:17,098
Life is so unnerving

878
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:20,059
For a servant who's not serving

879
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,186
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

880
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:24,855
Get off!

881
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:28,274
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

882
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:29,818
Huh?

883
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,778
Suddenly, those good
old days are gone

884
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,530
Oh!

885
00:38:34,572 --> 00:38:36,324
Ten years we've been rusting

886
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,659
Needing so much more
than dusting

887
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:40,619
Needing exercise

888
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:43,538
A chance to use our skills

889
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,209
Most days we just
lay around the castle

890
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,586
Flabby, fat and lazy

891
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,671
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

892
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:53,506
lt's a guest, it's a guest!

893
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:55,299
Sakes alive,
well, l'll be blessed

894
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,259
Wine's been poured,
and thank the Lord

895
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,136
l've had the napkins
freshly pressed

896
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:01,430
With dessert, she'll want tea

897
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,931
And, my dear,
that's fine with me

898
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,016
While the cups
do their soft-shoeing

899
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:07,018
l'll be bubbling,
l'll be brewing

900
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,728
l'll get warm, piping hot

901
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,772
Heaven's sake, is that a spot?

902
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,441
Clean it up, we want
the company impressed

903
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:15,484
We've got a lot to do

904
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:17,278
ls it one lump or two?

905
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,028
For you, our guest

906
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,154
She's our guest

907
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:20,364
She's our guest

908
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:21,865
She's our guest

909
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:25,786
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

910
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,662
lt's ten years since
we've had anybody here

911
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:28,663
And we're obsessed

912
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:30,832
With your meal, with your ease

913
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,625
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

914
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,961
While the candlelight's
still glowing

915
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:39,006
Let us help you,
we'll keep going

916
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:43,093
Course... by... course

917
00:39:43,135 --> 00:39:45,095
One by one

918
00:39:45,137 --> 00:39:47,681
Till you shout,
''Enough, l'm done!''

919
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:51,893
Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest

920
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,978
Tonight you'll prop
your feet up

921
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,563
But for now, let's eat up

922
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:59,566
Be our guest, be our guest

923
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,360
Be our guest

924
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:09,409
Please be our guest!

925
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:12,662
Bravo!

926
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:13,996
That was wonderful.

927
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,081
Thank you.

928
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,208
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

929
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,043
Good show, wasn't it?

930
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,461
Yes, everyone.

931
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:23,672
My goodness, look at the time.

932
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,507
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

933
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,968
Oh, l couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

934
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,969
lt's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

935
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,013
Enchanted!

936
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,097
Who said anything

937
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,891
about the castle
being enchanted?

938
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,934
lt was you, wasn't it?

939
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,686
l figured it out for myself.

940
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:43,523
l'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

941
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:45,067
Oh, would you like a tour?

942
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:46,735
Wait a second, wait a second.

943
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,486
l'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

944
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,780
We can't let her
go poking around

945
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,699
in certain places,
if you know what l mean.

946
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:55,159
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

947
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:56,577
l'm sure you know everything

948
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,245
there is to know
about the castle.

949
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:01,123
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

950
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:03,292
Yes, l do.

951
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,418
As you can see

952
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:07,254
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

953
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:09,464
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

954
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,550
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

955
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:13,926
This is yet another example

956
00:41:13,926 --> 00:41:15,886
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

957
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:17,221
and, as l always say

958
00:41:17,263 --> 00:41:19,348
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

959
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:22,893
Uh, where was l?

960
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:26,062
As you were.

961
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:28,440
Now, then, if l may
draw your attention

962
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:30,692
to the flying buttresses
above the...

963
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:32,193
Uh, Mademoiselle?

964
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,158
What's up there?

965
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,117
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

966
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,493
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

967
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:42,744
in the west wing.

968
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:44,746
Dusty, dull, very boring.

969
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:47,249
Ah, so that's the west wing.

970
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,958
Nice going.

971
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,836
l wonder what
he's hiding up there?

972
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:52,795
Hiding?

973
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:54,255
The master is hiding nothing.

974
00:41:54,297 --> 00:41:56,007
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

975
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:58,384
Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to

976
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,052
uh-uh, uh... see something else.

977
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:02,679
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

978
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:03,639
maybe later.

979
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,057
Th-The gardens or-or

980
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:06,933
the-the-the-the library,
perhaps.

981
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,143
You have a library?

982
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:09,727
Yes, oh, indeed.

983
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:10,812
With books.

984
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:11,980
Scads of books!

985
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:12,980
Mountains of books!

986
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:13,981
Forests of books!

987
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:14,982
-Cascades!
-Longboats!

988
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,025
Swamps of books!

989
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,860
More books than you'll

990
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:19,903
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

991
00:42:19,945 --> 00:42:22,364
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

992
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:24,366
who ever set pen to paper.

993
00:43:14,162 --> 00:43:15,454
Oh!

994
00:43:59,328 --> 00:44:01,246
Why did you come here?

995
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:03,165
l'm... l'm sorry.

996
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:05,667
l warned you never to come here.

997
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,835
l didn't mean any harm.

998
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,504
Do you realize
what you could have done?!

999
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:11,547
Please, stop.

1000
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:13,299
Get out!

1001
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,051
No!

1002
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:18,846
Get... out!

1003
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:30,982
Where are you going?

1004
00:44:31,024 --> 00:44:32,275
Promise or no promise

1005
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:34,026
l can't stay here
another minute.

1006
00:44:34,026 --> 00:44:36,028
Oh, no, wait, please.

1007
00:44:36,112 --> 00:44:37,363
Please wait.

1008
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:15,731
Oh!

1009
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:46,593
Oh!

1010
00:46:56,907 --> 00:46:58,701
Here now.

1011
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:00,160
Oh, don't do that.

1012
00:47:03,247 --> 00:47:05,999
Just hold still.

1013
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,335
That hurts!

1014
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:10,253
lf you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

1015
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:11,629
Well, if you hadn't
have run away

1016
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:12,839
this wouldn't have happened!

1017
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,800
lf you hadn't frightened me,
l wouldn't have run away!

1018
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:18,636
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

1019
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:20,804
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

1020
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,142
Now hold still.

1021
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,977
This might sting a little.

1022
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,061
Hmm?

1023
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:32,565
By the way, thank you.

1024
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,400
For saving my life.

1025
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:40,489
You're welcome.

1026
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,582
l don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night

1027
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:54,835
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

1028
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:56,253
Ah.

1029
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:57,588
l'm listening.

1030
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,006
lt's like this.

1031
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:02,009
l've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

1032
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,928
but she needs a little...
persuasion.

1033
00:48:05,011 --> 00:48:08,223
Turned him down flat.

1034
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:09,891
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

1035
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:10,892
He was in here tonight

1036
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:13,644
raving about a beast
in a castle.

1037
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:15,313
Maurice is harmless.

1038
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:17,898
The point is,
Belle would do anything

1039
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,234
to keep him
from being locked up.

1040
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,403
Yeah. Even marry him.

1041
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:27,198
So you want me

1042
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,200
to throw her father
into the asylum

1043
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:32,036
unless she agrees to marry you.

1044
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:35,498
Oh, that is despicable.

1045
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:36,874
l love it!

1046
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,627
lf no one will help me

1047
00:48:40,753 --> 00:48:42,337
then l'll go back alone.

1048
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:43,964
Yes, is that everything?

1049
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,882
l don't care what it takes.

1050
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,176
l'll find that castle,
and somehow

1051
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,011
l'll get her out of there.

1052
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,143
Belle? Maurice?

1053
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,061
Oh, well.

1054
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,813
l guess it's not going
to work after all.

1055
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,231
They have to come back sometime.

1056
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,735
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

1057
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:08,069
Lefou...

1058
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,989
don't move from that spot

1059
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,740
until Belle and
her father come home.

1060
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,659
But, but, l...

1061
00:49:16,202 --> 00:49:18,078
Aw, nuts.

1062
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:44,186
l've never felt this way
about anyone.

1063
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:46,438
l want to do something for her.

1064
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:48,023
But what?

1065
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:50,024
Well, there's the usual things.

1066
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:51,317
Flowers, chocolates.

1067
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:53,069
Promises you don't intend
to keep.

1068
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:54,820
Ah, no, no.

1069
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:57,156
lt has to be something
very special.

1070
00:49:57,198 --> 00:49:59,325
Something that sparks
her interest.

1071
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:00,576
Wait a minute!

1072
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:07,123
Belle, there's something
l want to show you.

1073
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:11,044
But first, you have
to close your eyes.

1074
00:50:13,004 --> 00:50:14,505
lt's a surprise.

1075
00:50:25,182 --> 00:50:26,600
Can l open them?

1076
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:28,560
No, no. Not yet.

1077
00:50:28,601 --> 00:50:31,187
Wait here.

1078
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:36,567
Now can l open them?

1079
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:38,194
All right.

1080
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,320
Now.

1081
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:49,996
l can't believe it!

1082
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:52,165
l've never seen so many books
in all my life!

1083
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:53,791
You-You like it?

1084
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,418
lt's wonderful!

1085
00:50:55,459 --> 00:50:57,336
Then it's yours.

1086
00:50:57,336 --> 00:50:59,255
Oh, thank you so much.

1087
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:00,923
Oh, would you look at that!

1088
00:51:00,964 --> 00:51:02,799
l knew it would work.

1089
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:03,967
What? What worked?

1090
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:06,636
lt's very encouraging.

1091
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:08,263
lsn't this exciting?

1092
00:51:08,388 --> 00:51:09,639
l didn't see anything.

1093
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:10,807
Come along, Chip.

1094
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:12,517
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

1095
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:13,935
But what are they talking about?

1096
00:51:13,976 --> 00:51:15,269
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

1097
00:52:00,728 --> 00:52:02,729
There's something sweet

1098
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,356
And almost kind

1099
00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:07,859
But he was mean,
and he was coarse and unrefined

1100
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:11,738
And now he's dear, and so unsure

1101
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:14,282
l wonder why l didn't see it
there before

1102
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,421
She glanced this way

1103
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:31,923
l thought l saw

1104
00:52:31,964 --> 00:52:35,551
And when we touched,
she didn't shudder at my paw

1105
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:37,178
No, it can't be

1106
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,221
l'll just ignore

1107
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:43,100
But then she's never looked
at me that way before

1108
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:51,357
New and a bit alarming

1109
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:59,531
Who'd have ever thought
that this could be?

1110
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:06,079
True that he's no
Prince Charming

1111
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:08,581
But there's something in him

1112
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:13,878
That l simply didn't see...

1113
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,046
Well, who'd have thought?

1114
00:53:15,087 --> 00:53:16,005
Well, bless my soul

1115
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:17,131
Well, who'd have known?

1116
00:53:17,173 --> 00:53:18,048
Well, who indeed?

1117
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,049
And who'd have guessed

1118
00:53:19,091 --> 00:53:20,509
They'd come together
on their own?

1119
00:53:20,551 --> 00:53:21,468
lt's so peculiar

1120
00:53:21,468 --> 00:53:22,427
We'll wait and see

1121
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:25,180
A few days more

1122
00:53:25,222 --> 00:53:29,434
There may be something there
that wasn't there before...

1123
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,227
You know, perhaps there is

1124
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:34,272
Something there
that wasn't there before

1125
00:53:34,313 --> 00:53:36,023
What?

1126
00:53:36,023 --> 00:53:39,318
There may be something there
that wasn't there before.

1127
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:40,903
What's there, Mama?

1128
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:42,237
Shh!

1129
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:46,199
l'll tell you when you're older.

1130
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:47,158
Right, then!

1131
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,743
You all know why we're here.

1132
00:53:48,785 --> 00:53:52,163
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

1133
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:53,956
to create the most magical

1134
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:57,877
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

1135
00:53:57,918 --> 00:53:59,211
''Or beast...''

1136
00:54:01,797 --> 00:54:03,507
Right.

1137
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,925
Need l remind you

1138
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:08,386
that if the last petal falls
from this rose

1139
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:09,637
the spell will never be...

1140
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,472
broken!

1141
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,932
Very well.

1142
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:14,892
You all know your assignments.

1143
00:54:14,934 --> 00:54:16,769
Half of you to the west wing.

1144
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:18,562
Half of you to the east wing.

1145
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:20,564
The rest of you, come with me.

1146
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:28,279
Oh, lighten up, Cogsworth,
and let nature take its course.

1147
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:30,865
lt's obvious there's
a spark between them.

1148
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:33,701
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

1149
00:54:33,743 --> 00:54:35,494
You know... a little.

1150
00:54:36,454 --> 00:54:37,663
Besides, they must fall in love

1151
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:39,415
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

1152
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:40,791
Ah, human again.

1153
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:42,292
Human again.

1154
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:45,295
Yes, think what that means.

1155
00:54:48,048 --> 00:54:50,508
l'll be cooking again

1156
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,385
Be good looking again

1157
00:54:52,427 --> 00:54:56,013
With a mademoiselle on each arm

1158
00:54:56,055 --> 00:54:58,599
When l'm human again

1159
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:00,225
Only human again

1160
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:03,687
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

1161
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:05,480
l'll be courting again

1162
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,274
Chic and sporting again

1163
00:55:07,315 --> 00:55:10,151
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

1164
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:12,695
Ha, ha!
l'll hop down off this shelf

1165
00:55:12,737 --> 00:55:14,530
And tout de suite be myself

1166
00:55:14,572 --> 00:55:17,491
l can't wait to be human again

1167
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,495
When we're human again

1168
00:55:21,537 --> 00:55:23,288
Only human again

1169
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:26,082
When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more

1170
00:55:26,124 --> 00:55:30,753
When we're human again,
good and human again

1171
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:33,172
Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer?

1172
00:55:33,214 --> 00:55:35,132
l'll wear lipstick and rouge

1173
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:36,425
And l won't be so huge

1174
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:39,970
Why, l'll easily fit
through that door

1175
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:41,805
l'll exude savoir faire

1176
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,724
l'll wear gowns, l'll have hair

1177
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:46,768
lt's my prayer to be human again

1178
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:53,232
When we're human again

1179
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,942
Only human again

1180
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,195
When the world once more
starts making sense

1181
00:55:58,237 --> 00:55:59,822
l'll unwind, for a change

1182
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:01,490
Really? That'd be strange

1183
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,493
Can l help it if l'm t-t-tense?

1184
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:05,911
ln a shack by the sea

1185
00:56:05,952 --> 00:56:07,662
l'll sit back, sipping tea

1186
00:56:07,662 --> 00:56:10,873
Let my early retirement commence

1187
00:56:10,915 --> 00:56:12,542
Far from fools made of wax

1188
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:16,170
l'll get down to brass tacks
and relax!

1189
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,757
When l'm human again

1190
00:56:19,798 --> 00:56:23,176
So sweep the dust from the floor

1191
00:56:23,218 --> 00:56:26,596
Let's let some light in the room

1192
00:56:26,638 --> 00:56:28,223
l can feel, l can tell

1193
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:31,184
Someone might break the spell
any day now

1194
00:56:32,852 --> 00:56:36,105
Shine up the brass on the door

1195
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:38,899
Alert the dust pail and broom

1196
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:40,901
lf it all goes as planned

1197
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:46,031
Our time may be at hand
any day now

1198
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,284
Open the shutters,
and let in some air

1199
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:53,121
Put these here,
and put those over there

1200
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:56,457
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

1201
00:56:56,499 --> 00:56:59,084
And throw them away

1202
00:57:04,965 --> 00:57:07,550
We'll be human again

1203
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,677
Only human again

1204
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:12,305
When the girl
finally sets us all free

1205
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:14,807
Cheeks a-blooming again

1206
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,600
We're assuming again

1207
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,478
We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre

1208
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,687
We'll be playing again

1209
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,898
Holidaying again

1210
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,984
And we're praying it's ASAP

1211
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,986
We will push, we will shove

1212
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,863
They will both fall in love

1213
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,574
And we'll finally
be human again...

1214
00:57:35,117 --> 00:57:38,162
For never was a story
of more woe

1215
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,373
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

1216
00:57:41,415 --> 00:57:43,792
Could you read it again?

1217
00:57:43,834 --> 00:57:45,919
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

1218
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:48,046
Uh, all right.

1219
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:50,798
Uh...

1220
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,050
Uh... l can't.

1221
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:55,720
You mean, you never learned?

1222
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:57,847
l learned... a little.

1223
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,432
lt's just been so long.

1224
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:02,643
Well, here, l'll help you.

1225
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:04,227
Let's start here.

1226
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:06,897
Here.

1227
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:08,815
Okay, ''Twoe...''

1228
00:58:08,857 --> 00:58:09,774
''Two.''

1229
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,818
''Two... l knew that.

1230
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:14,445
Two households...''

1231
00:58:14,487 --> 00:58:18,365
We'll be dancing again

1232
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:19,992
We'll be twirling again

1233
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:23,453
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

1234
00:58:23,495 --> 00:58:24,704
When we're human again

1235
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,414
Only human again

1236
00:58:26,456 --> 00:58:29,959
We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes

1237
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:31,836
We'll be floating again

1238
00:58:31,878 --> 00:58:33,087
We'll be gliding again

1239
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:36,632
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please

1240
00:58:36,674 --> 00:58:39,885
Like a real human does

1241
00:58:39,927 --> 00:58:43,221
l'll be all that l was

1242
00:58:43,305 --> 00:58:47,642
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

1243
00:58:47,684 --> 00:58:51,104
And we're all

1244
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:56,150
Human again!

1245
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,247
Tonight is the night.

1246
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:13,916
l'm not sure l can do this.

1247
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,459
You don't have time to be timid.

1248
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:17,670
You must be bold, daring.

1249
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:19,380
Bold, daring.

1250
00:59:22,216 --> 00:59:24,301
There will be music...

1251
00:59:24,342 --> 00:59:26,678
romantic candlelight...

1252
00:59:26,678 --> 00:59:28,596
provided by myself.

1253
00:59:28,596 --> 00:59:30,014
And when the moment is right

1254
00:59:30,056 --> 00:59:31,808
you confess your love.

1255
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:33,726
Yes, l con...

1256
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:36,479
l-l... No, l can't.

1257
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,897
You care for the girl,
don't you?

1258
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:40,107
More than anything.

1259
00:59:40,149 --> 00:59:41,775
Well, then,
you must tell her.

1260
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:45,070
Voila!

1261
00:59:45,112 --> 00:59:47,364
Oh, you look so... so...

1262
00:59:47,405 --> 00:59:49,240
Stupid.

1263
00:59:49,282 --> 00:59:52,285
Not quite the word
l was looking for.

1264
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:54,287
Perhaps a little more
off the top?

1265
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,585
Your lady awaits.

1266
01:00:23,438 --> 01:00:28,485
Tale as old as time

1267
01:00:28,526 --> 01:00:30,820
True as it can be

1268
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:36,242
Barely even friends

1269
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:38,744
Then somebody bends

1270
01:00:38,786 --> 01:00:40,913
Unexpectedly

1271
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:45,167
Just a little change

1272
01:00:48,128 --> 01:00:50,672
Small, to say the least

1273
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,174
Both a little scared

1274
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:56,177
Neither one prepared

1275
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:58,929
Beauty and the Beast

1276
01:01:01,765 --> 01:01:03,558
Ever just the same

1277
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:09,022
Ever a surprise

1278
01:01:09,063 --> 01:01:11,107
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1279
01:01:11,149 --> 01:01:13,776
Ever as before

1280
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:16,112
Ever just as sure

1281
01:01:16,153 --> 01:01:19,531
As the sun will rise

1282
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:25,537
Tale as old as time

1283
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:29,958
Tune as old as song

1284
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:33,086
Bittersweet and strange

1285
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,463
Finding you can change

1286
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:38,340
Learning you were wrong

1287
01:01:40,217 --> 01:01:44,763
Certain as the sun

1288
01:01:44,805 --> 01:01:47,557
Rising in the east

1289
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,767
Tale as old as time

1290
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:52,437
Song as old as rhyme

1291
01:01:52,478 --> 01:01:55,398
Beauty and the Beast

1292
01:01:55,439 --> 01:01:57,108
Shh!

1293
01:01:58,192 --> 01:02:01,653
Tale as old as time

1294
01:02:01,695 --> 01:02:05,699
Song as old as rhyme

1295
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:12,580
Beauty and the Beast.

1296
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:16,125
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

1297
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:18,252
lt's past your bedtime.

1298
01:02:18,294 --> 01:02:20,629
Good night, love.

1299
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:46,486
Belle?

1300
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:49,864
Are you... happy here with me?

1301
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:51,616
Yes.

1302
01:02:55,494 --> 01:02:57,913
What is it?

1303
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:00,499
lf only l could see
my father again

1304
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,125
just for a moment.

1305
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,502
l miss him so much.

1306
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:11,759
There is a way.

1307
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:15,388
This mirror will show
you anything...

1308
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:18,724
anything you wish to see.

1309
01:03:18,724 --> 01:03:21,477
l'd like to see my father,
please.

1310
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:29,275
Papa?

1311
01:03:29,317 --> 01:03:30,485
Oh, no.

1312
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:32,653
He's sick.

1313
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:36,198
He may be dying
and he's all alone.

1314
01:03:41,203 --> 01:03:44,539
Then, you must go to him.

1315
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:45,832
What did you say?

1316
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:46,875
l release you.

1317
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:49,252
You are no longer my prisoner.

1318
01:03:49,294 --> 01:03:51,838
You mean... l'm free?

1319
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:53,840
Yes.

1320
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:55,966
Oh, thank you.

1321
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:58,093
Hold on, Papa.

1322
01:03:58,135 --> 01:04:00,304
l'm on my way.

1323
01:04:00,345 --> 01:04:02,055
Take it with you

1324
01:04:02,097 --> 01:04:06,351
so you'll always have
a way to look back

1325
01:04:06,393 --> 01:04:08,144
and remember me.

1326
01:04:10,688 --> 01:04:13,524
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

1327
01:04:21,782 --> 01:04:24,159
Well, Your Highness, l must say

1328
01:04:24,201 --> 01:04:26,828
everything is going
just swimmingly.

1329
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,830
l knew you had it in you.

1330
01:04:28,872 --> 01:04:30,290
l let her go.

1331
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,208
Yes, yes.

1332
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,001
Splen...

1333
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:36,754
You what?

1334
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:38,297
How could you do that?

1335
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:39,757
l had to.

1336
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:41,341
Yes, but...

1337
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:42,634
Why?

1338
01:04:42,676 --> 01:04:46,179
Because... l love her.

1339
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:47,681
He did what?

1340
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:48,848
Yes.

1341
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,558
l'm afraid it's true.

1342
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,934
She's going away?

1343
01:04:51,976 --> 01:04:53,936
But he was so close.

1344
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:58,232
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1345
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:00,859
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

1346
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:02,361
But it's not enough.

1347
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,696
She has to love him in return.

1348
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:07,907
Now it's too late.

1349
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:18,834
Papa! Papa!

1350
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:33,306
Ooh.

1351
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:35,391
They're back.

1352
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,768
Belle?

1353
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,769
Shh.

1354
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,187
lt's all right, Papa.

1355
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,231
l'm home.

1356
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,398
l thought l'd never

1357
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,901
see you again.

1358
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,694
l missed you so much.

1359
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,695
But the Beast?

1360
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:50,613
Did you... how did you escape?

1361
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,906
l didn't escape, Papa.

1362
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,116
He let me go.

1363
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,450
That horrible beast?

1364
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,453
But he's different now, Papa.

1365
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,663
He's changed somehow.

1366
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,751
Hi.

1367
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:07,545
Oh. A stowaway.

1368
01:06:07,587 --> 01:06:10,882
Why, hello there, little fella.

1369
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:12,675
Didn't think l'd see you again.

1370
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:14,135
Belle, why'd you go away?

1371
01:06:14,176 --> 01:06:15,720
Don't you like us anymore?

1372
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:18,681
Oh, Chip, of course l do.

1373
01:06:18,722 --> 01:06:20,682
lt's just...

1374
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:24,644
May l help you?

1375
01:06:24,686 --> 01:06:26,563
l've come to collect
your father.

1376
01:06:26,605 --> 01:06:28,023
My father?

1377
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:29,983
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

1378
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:32,110
We'll take good care of him.

1379
01:06:33,402 --> 01:06:34,528
My father's not crazy.

1380
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,280
He was raving like a lunatic.

1381
01:06:36,322 --> 01:06:38,115
We all heard him, didn't we?

1382
01:06:40,951 --> 01:06:42,452
No, l won't let you.

1383
01:06:42,536 --> 01:06:43,412
Belle?

1384
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:45,997
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1385
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:47,916
Just how big was the beast?

1386
01:06:49,626 --> 01:06:53,004
He was... l mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

1387
01:06:53,129 --> 01:06:54,755
l-l'd say at least eight...

1388
01:06:54,797 --> 01:06:57,091
No, more like ten feet.

1389
01:06:57,133 --> 01:07:01,053
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1390
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:04,347
lt's true, l tell you.

1391
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:06,266
Get him out of here.

1392
01:07:06,308 --> 01:07:07,517
Let go of me.

1393
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:08,643
No!

1394
01:07:08,685 --> 01:07:10,645
You can't do this.

1395
01:07:10,687 --> 01:07:11,521
Poor Belle.

1396
01:07:11,562 --> 01:07:14,065
lt's a shame about your father.

1397
01:07:14,106 --> 01:07:15,900
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1398
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:18,736
Hmm, l might be able
to clear up this...

1399
01:07:18,777 --> 01:07:20,404
little misunderstanding.

1400
01:07:20,446 --> 01:07:21,488
lf...

1401
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:22,322
lf what?

1402
01:07:22,364 --> 01:07:24,241
lf you marry me.

1403
01:07:24,282 --> 01:07:25,200
What?

1404
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:26,826
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

1405
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:27,827
Never.

1406
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:29,412
Have it your way.

1407
01:07:29,496 --> 01:07:30,246
Belle.

1408
01:07:31,873 --> 01:07:33,374
Let go of me.

1409
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,918
My father's not crazy
and l can prove it.

1410
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,087
Show me the Beast.

1411
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:43,800
ls it dangerous?

1412
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:46,177
Oh, no, no,
he'd never hurt anyone.

1413
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:50,515
Please, l know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1414
01:07:50,598 --> 01:07:52,100
He's my friend.

1415
01:07:52,141 --> 01:07:53,309
lf l didn't know better

1416
01:07:53,351 --> 01:07:55,770
l'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1417
01:07:55,811 --> 01:07:58,272
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

1418
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:02,234
She's as crazy as the old man.

1419
01:08:03,777 --> 01:08:05,529
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1420
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:06,404
-He'll come after them
in the night.
-No!

1421
01:08:06,446 --> 01:08:07,364
We're not safe

1422
01:08:07,405 --> 01:08:08,907
till his head
is mounted on my wall.

1423
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:10,658
l say we kill the Beast!

1424
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:13,369
We're not safe until he's dead

1425
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:14,912
He'll come stalking us at night

1426
01:08:14,954 --> 01:08:16,831
Set to sacrifice our children

1427
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,540
To his monstrous appetite

1428
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,250
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1429
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:21,793
lf we let him wander free

1430
01:08:21,835 --> 01:08:25,380
So it's time to take
some action, boys

1431
01:08:25,422 --> 01:08:30,343
lt's time to follow me

1432
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:33,763
Through the mist,
through the woods

1433
01:08:33,804 --> 01:08:35,556
Through the darkness
and the shadows

1434
01:08:35,598 --> 01:08:37,892
lt's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride

1435
01:08:37,933 --> 01:08:41,228
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

1436
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:44,564
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1437
01:08:44,606 --> 01:08:47,150
lt's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones

1438
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:50,403
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

1439
01:08:50,445 --> 01:08:52,321
Hear him roar, see him foam

1440
01:08:52,363 --> 01:08:54,031
But we're not coming home

1441
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:55,366
Till he's dead

1442
01:08:55,408 --> 01:08:57,076
Good and dead

1443
01:08:57,118 --> 01:08:58,160
Kill the Beast!

1444
01:08:58,202 --> 01:08:59,745
No, l won't let you do this.

1445
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,206
lf you're not with us,
you're against us.

1446
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:03,248
Bring the old man.

1447
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,833
Get your hands off me.

1448
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,210
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1449
01:09:07,252 --> 01:09:08,461
Let us out!

1450
01:09:08,503 --> 01:09:11,047
We'll rid the village
of this beast.

1451
01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:12,173
Who's with me?

1452
01:09:13,633 --> 01:09:15,593
Raise your torch,
mount your horse

1453
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:17,887
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1454
01:09:17,928 --> 01:09:20,264
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1455
01:09:20,305 --> 01:09:22,015
Through the mist,
through the wood

1456
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,600
Where, within a haunted castle

1457
01:09:23,642 --> 01:09:26,186
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

1458
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:29,647
lt's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain

1459
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:32,734
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1460
01:09:32,775 --> 01:09:34,485
Sally forth, tally ho

1461
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:36,028
Grab your sword, grab your bow

1462
01:09:36,112 --> 01:09:37,571
Praise the Lord, and here we go.

1463
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:40,824
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1464
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:43,076
l have to warn the Beast.

1465
01:09:43,118 --> 01:09:44,953
This is all my fault.

1466
01:09:44,995 --> 01:09:46,788
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

1467
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:48,123
Now, now.

1468
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:49,624
We'll think of something.

1469
01:09:52,585 --> 01:09:53,711
Ah!

1470
01:09:56,547 --> 01:09:58,841
We don't like
what we don't understand

1471
01:09:58,882 --> 01:10:00,551
ln fact, it scares us

1472
01:10:00,551 --> 01:10:03,095
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1473
01:10:03,136 --> 01:10:04,513
Bring your guns,
bring your knives

1474
01:10:04,596 --> 01:10:06,056
Save your children
and your wives

1475
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:09,058
We'll save our village
and our lives

1476
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,518
We'll kill the Beast!

1477
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,894
l knew it.

1478
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:14,230
l knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1479
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:16,982
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1480
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,360
Could it be?

1481
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:20,110
ls it she?

1482
01:10:20,194 --> 01:10:21,528
Sacre bleu!

1483
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:22,487
lnvaders.

1484
01:10:22,529 --> 01:10:23,780
Encroachers.

1485
01:10:23,822 --> 01:10:25,115
And they have the mirror.

1486
01:10:25,157 --> 01:10:26,116
Warn the master.

1487
01:10:26,157 --> 01:10:28,034
lf it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1488
01:10:28,076 --> 01:10:28,952
Who's with me?

1489
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:29,953
Ah!

1490
01:10:29,994 --> 01:10:31,913
Take whatever booty you can find

1491
01:10:31,954 --> 01:10:34,916
but remember, the Beast is mine!

1492
01:10:34,957 --> 01:10:36,625
Lights ablaze, banners high

1493
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:38,294
We go marching into battle

1494
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,921
Unafraid, although
the danger just increased

1495
01:10:40,963 --> 01:10:42,631
Raise the flag, sing the song

1496
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:43,924
Here we come, we're 50 strong

1497
01:10:43,965 --> 01:10:46,426
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1498
01:10:46,426 --> 01:10:48,178
Let's kill the Beast!

1499
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:52,181
-Pardon me, Master?
-Leave me in peace.

1500
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:54,475
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

1501
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:57,478
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1502
01:10:57,561 --> 01:10:59,271
This isn't working.

1503
01:10:59,313 --> 01:11:01,690
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

1504
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:04,109
Wait, l know.

1505
01:11:06,403 --> 01:11:09,114
What shall we do, Master?

1506
01:11:09,155 --> 01:11:11,532
lt doesn't matter now.

1507
01:11:11,574 --> 01:11:13,576
Just let them come.

1508
01:11:13,618 --> 01:11:16,787
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1509
01:11:16,829 --> 01:11:17,997
Kill the Beast!

1510
01:11:30,508 --> 01:11:31,175
Now!

1511
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:52,528
Yes!

1512
01:11:55,948 --> 01:11:57,575
Here we go.

1513
01:12:00,744 --> 01:12:02,287
What the devil?

1514
01:12:03,372 --> 01:12:04,581
Belle, look out!

1515
01:12:10,545 --> 01:12:13,714
You guys got to try this thing.

1516
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:22,222
Up here you scurvy scum! Now!

1517
01:12:39,613 --> 01:12:40,864
Oh!

1518
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,536
And stay out!

1519
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:34,997
Eww!

1520
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:01,021
Get up.

1521
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:04,900
Get up!

1522
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,527
What's the matter, Beast?

1523
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:10,989
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1524
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,787
No!

1525
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,000
Belle...

1526
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,377
No! Gaston, don't!

1527
01:14:30,798 --> 01:14:33,593
Let's go, Philippe.

1528
01:14:56,155 --> 01:14:57,740
Come on out and fight!

1529
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:03,078
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1530
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,789
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1531
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:08,124
when she had someone like me?

1532
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:21,094
lt's over, Beast.

1533
01:15:21,094 --> 01:15:22,804
Belle is mine!

1534
01:15:27,976 --> 01:15:29,561
Let me go. Let me go.

1535
01:15:29,602 --> 01:15:31,270
Please, don't hurt me.

1536
01:15:31,312 --> 01:15:32,271
l'll do anything.

1537
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:33,856
Anything!

1538
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:49,370
Get out.

1539
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:51,497
Beast!

1540
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:52,665
Belle?

1541
01:16:00,297 --> 01:16:02,382
Belle?

1542
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:10,181
You came back.

1543
01:16:46,756 --> 01:16:49,592
You...

1544
01:16:49,634 --> 01:16:51,219
You came back.

1545
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,887
Of course l came back.

1546
01:16:52,929 --> 01:16:54,597
l couldn't let them...

1547
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:56,474
Oh, this is all my fault.

1548
01:16:56,515 --> 01:16:58,851
lf only l'd gotten here sooner.

1549
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:02,229
Maybe... it's better...

1550
01:17:02,271 --> 01:17:03,522
it's better this way.

1551
01:17:03,563 --> 01:17:05,774
Don't talk like that.

1552
01:17:05,774 --> 01:17:07,233
You'll be all right.

1553
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:08,651
We're together now.

1554
01:17:08,693 --> 01:17:10,945
Everything's going to be fine.

1555
01:17:10,945 --> 01:17:13,072
You'll see.

1556
01:17:13,114 --> 01:17:16,242
And... at least...

1557
01:17:16,283 --> 01:17:18,911
l got to see you...

1558
01:17:18,953 --> 01:17:20,579
one last time.

1559
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,423
No. No.

1560
01:17:32,465 --> 01:17:36,260
Please... Please...

1561
01:17:36,302 --> 01:17:38,178
Please, don't leave me.

1562
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:43,975
l love you.

1563
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,854
Belle.

1564
01:19:18,896 --> 01:19:20,522
lt's me.

1565
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,787
lt is you.

1566
01:20:08,108 --> 01:20:10,401
Lumiere.

1567
01:20:10,443 --> 01:20:12,904
Cogsworth!

1568
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:15,031
Mrs. Potts!

1569
01:20:15,072 --> 01:20:16,198
Look at us.

1570
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,741
Mama, Mama.

1571
01:20:22,955 --> 01:20:24,206
My goodness.

1572
01:20:24,247 --> 01:20:26,041
lt is a miracle.

1573
01:20:36,425 --> 01:20:37,760
L'amour.

1574
01:20:41,471 --> 01:20:43,682
Well, Lumiere, old friend.

1575
01:20:43,682 --> 01:20:44,933
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1576
01:20:44,975 --> 01:20:45,892
Of course, mon ami.

1577
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:47,519
l told you she would
break the spell.

1578
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,063
l beg your pardon, old friend

1579
01:20:50,104 --> 01:20:52,356
but l believe l told you.

1580
01:20:52,398 --> 01:20:54,025
No, you didn't-- l told you.

1581
01:20:54,066 --> 01:20:55,568
You most certainly did not

1582
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:57,862
you pompous,
paraffin-headed peabrain.

1583
01:20:57,903 --> 01:21:00,406
En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.

1584
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:01,657
Take that.

1585
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:09,164
Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?

1586
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:11,082
Of course, my dear.

1587
01:21:11,082 --> 01:21:13,167
Of course.

1588
01:21:13,209 --> 01:21:16,212
Do l still have
to sleep in the cupboard?

1589
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:24,594
Certain as the sun

1590
01:21:24,636 --> 01:21:26,888
Rising in the east

1591
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:29,724
Tale as old as time

1592
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:31,976
Song as old as rhyme

1593
01:21:32,018 --> 01:21:38,065
Beauty and the Beast

1594
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,567
Tale as old as time

1595
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,779
Song as old as rhyme

1596
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:50,243
Beauty and the Beast.

1597
01:22:04,631 --> 01:22:09,135
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

1598
01:22:13,264 --> 01:22:19,311
Tale as old as time

1599
01:22:19,353 --> 01:22:24,733
True as it can be

1600
01:22:24,775 --> 01:22:28,278
Barely even friends

1601
01:22:28,278 --> 01:22:31,155
Then somebody bends

1602
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:36,952
Unexpectedly

1603
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:43,000
Just a little change

1604
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:46,169
Small to say the least

1605
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:49,088
Both a little scared

1606
01:22:49,088 --> 01:22:52,341
Neither one prepared

1607
01:22:52,383 --> 01:22:57,596
Beauty and the Beast

1608
01:22:57,596 --> 01:23:03,685
Ever just the same

1609
01:23:03,727 --> 01:23:09,816
Ever a surprise

1610
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:12,985
Ever as before

1611
01:23:13,027 --> 01:23:15,863
And ever just as sure

1612
01:23:15,946 --> 01:23:20,576
As the sun will rise

1613
01:23:20,576 --> 01:23:23,787
Whoa, oh-oh

1614
01:23:23,829 --> 01:23:26,498
Whoa, oh

1615
01:23:42,512 --> 01:23:45,640
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

1616
01:23:45,682 --> 01:23:52,063
Ever just the same

1617
01:23:52,105 --> 01:23:57,818
Ever a surprise

1618
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:00,696
Ever as before

1619
01:24:00,737 --> 01:24:03,573
Ever just as sure

1620
01:24:03,615 --> 01:24:07,744
As the sun will rise

1621
01:24:07,786 --> 01:24:12,874
Oh, oh, oh...

1622
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:19,171
Tale as old as time

1623
01:24:19,213 --> 01:24:24,926
Tune as old as song

1624
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:27,846
Bittersweet and strange

1625
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:30,723
Finding you can change

1626
01:24:30,807 --> 01:24:36,854
Learning you were wrong

1627
01:24:36,896 --> 01:24:40,065
Certain as the sun

1628
01:24:40,107 --> 01:24:43,193
Certain as the sun

1629
01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:46,112
Rising in the east

1630
01:24:46,112 --> 01:24:48,698
Tale as old as time

1631
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:51,617
Song as old as rhyme

1632
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:57,623
Beauty and the Beast

1633
01:24:57,665 --> 01:25:00,834
Tale as old as time

1634
01:25:00,876 --> 01:25:04,296
Song as old as rhyme

1635
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:14,889
Beauty and the Beast

1636
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:18,559
Oh, oh-oh-oh

1637
01:25:18,601 --> 01:25:22,271
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1638
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:30,945
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

1639
01:25:33,823 --> 01:25:47,711
Beauty and the Beast.

3
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:41,128
Change course.
Direction, 120 degrees.

4
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:43,673
Roger, hard to port.

5
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,549
Hard to port.

6
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:48,094
I need navigational information.

7
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:18,999
It all began one day...

8
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,419
without warning...

9
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,338
like this...

10
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:46,318
Still no answer at Taguchi's?

11
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:48,112
No.

12
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,657
It's been a week.
He must have his reasons.

13
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:58,289
It shouldn't take a whole week
to work on that disk.

14
00:01:58,372 --> 00:01:59,749
No...

15
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,626
Something's wrong.

16
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:05,379
Maybe I should see if he's okay.

17
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:08,632
I just got the creeps.

18
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,426
What?

19
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,888
I don't know, I just feel
like something's wrong.

20
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:18,058
Like something's... horribly wrong.

21
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:36,494
What's up with Taguchi?

22
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:38,496
I don't know.

23
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,334
If we don't get that disk now,
we're in real trouble.

24
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:48,130
The deadline's tomorrow.

25
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,590
I know that.

26
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:53,803
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't heard a thing.

27
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:58,849
I think I'd better go see
how he's doing.

28
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:06,709
A KUROSAWA Kiyoshi film

29
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,340
Taguchi?

PULSE
(Kairo)

31
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,930
Hey, you are here.

32
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:45,015
Hey, Michi...

33
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:48,560
I was worried about you.
You haven't called.

34
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,312
Right, sorry.

35
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:54,608
Did you finish working on that disk?

36
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:57,611
Yeah, it's somewhere in that pile.

37
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:05,577
You okay? Are you sick?

38
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:07,621
No...

39
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:13,168
What have you been up to,
all on your lonesome? We're friends.

40
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,129
Yeah... Stuff...

41
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:17,840
Help yourself to the disk.

42
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:25,305
You ought to label your disks.

43
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,437
This it?

44
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,913
The one marked Work File?

45
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,292
Taguchi?

46
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,557
Michi.

47
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,683
Oh, Junco.

48
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,102
You okay? Was it awful?

49
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:36,478
I'm fine.

50
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:38,438
I'd say it's break time.

51
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,445
Oh, I forgot. Here.

52
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,281
Thanks.

53
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:56,915
It's so upsetting.

54
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,378
I don't know what he was
so depressed about.

55
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:07,217
He never said anything,
so what could we have done?

56
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,512
Maybe...

57
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,809
he suddenly just wanted to die.

58
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,731
I get that way sometimes.

59
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:31,116
It's so easy to hang yourself.

60
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:45,797
Hey! Why so gloomy?

61
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,216
Oh, sorry.

62
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,468
About Taguchi?

63
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:52,679
It's just... If only I'd...

64
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:56,433
He seemed like the Taguchi I know.

65
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:01,605
I never imagined
he'd do something like that.

66
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,859
Time to put it behind us.
Besides, it wasn't your fault.

67
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:07,653
Yeah...

68
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,751
Say... Would you take a look?

69
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:24,670
At what?

70
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:25,837
Taguchi's disk.

71
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:37,516
What is it?

72
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,775
It's Taguchi's place.

73
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,236
Is that Taguchi?

74
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:52,197
Yeah, I think so.

75
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:54,700
Look.

76
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:06,086
What's going on?
Isn't that the same scene?

77
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,838
I can't tell.

78
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,173
Hey, look.

79
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,426
That's a face...

80
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,304
A reflection.

81
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:16,596
You're right.

82
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,598
Can you blow it up?

83
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,976
Let me see...

84
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,589
That was Taguchi, wasn't it?

85
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:53,133
Sure seems like it.

86
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,719
What's going on?

87
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:00,307
Maybe something strange is going on.

88
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,184
Strange?

89
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,310
I don't know.

90
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,604
I don't even care anymore.

91
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:13,612
Something's definitely not right.

92
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:17,074
A message in a bottle
launched 10 years ago

93
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,117
by a boy
on Tanegashima Island

94
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,787
was recently discovered

95
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,166
on a beach in Malaysia
some 4,000 kms away.

96
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:27,834
Hikono Koichi was

97
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:32,422
a 4th grader when
he sent off his message.

98
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:35,884
Members of a local group,
cleaning up the beach,

99
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,347
a sea turtle habitat,

100
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,307
discovered the bottle by accident.

101
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:46,645
I never imagined it would find its way
to some foreign country.

102
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:50,190
I was shocked to get an answer
after 10 years.

103
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:52,984
The group located Hikono

104
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:56,988
through his former
elementary school.

105
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:00,700
Next, the National Weather Service

106
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:05,080
forecasts another unseasonably
hot summer, it's the 3rd

107
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:09,084
for eastern Japan...
for western Japan...

108
00:13:09,626 --> 00:13:11,878
Northern Japan... will...

109
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:22,324
"Welcome to the Internet."

110
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:31,791
No, this way, here.

111
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,792
Okay.

112
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,296
Next, okay.

113
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:37,506
Next.

114
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:43,553
"Have Fun."
Okay, I'll have fun.

115
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:47,766
Done. "Okay."

116
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:58,818
What's this crap?
Yes, I agree.

117
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:09,621
Next...

118
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:14,167
What? I guess that's okay.

119
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,671
Next again, huh?

120
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:19,506
What?

121
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:30,517
What the... oh, well...

122
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:46,700
What the hell...

123
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,716
Hey... this...

124
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,760
Who's... what's...

125
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:37,292
Would you like to meet a ghost?

126
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:58,772
Stupid crap!

127
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,286
What the...

128
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:21,229
Maybe you should change
the size on this batch file.

129
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,106
Using the variable?

130
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,190
Yeah.

131
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,902
So you'll find its property, right?

132
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:31,865
Oh, conventional memory.

133
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:33,241
Right.

134
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:35,326
See.

135
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:38,329
So that's how you do it.

136
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:50,675
Say...

137
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,388
Can the internet dial you up itself?

138
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:58,683
You in computer science?

139
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,104
No, economics.
No relation.

140
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,399
Huh... Sounds like a hacker.

141
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:09,277
A hacker...

142
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:11,529
Huh...

143
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,792
It said,
"Do you want to meet a ghost?"

144
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,586
Some website like that.

145
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:31,299
A ghost, huh...

146
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:06,626
Which website was that?

147
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,336
What?

148
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,964
Something about meeting ghosts?

149
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:15,009
I don't really know.
It just appeared last night.

150
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:16,845
Know the address?

151
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,473
What? Um... address?

152
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:22,058
I see.

153
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:26,813
Windows?

154
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:27,939
Yeah.

155
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,483
Open the Explorer log...

156
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:35,196
Oh, no, no, I really don't know
anything about computers.

157
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,952
The next time the site shows up,

158
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:44,038
click on it to bookmark it.

159
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:45,915
Not so fast.

160
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,293
Click...

161
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,759
Can you repeat that?

162
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:58,219
Click on it.

163
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:00,513
Click... on... it...

164
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:02,348
To bookmark it.

165
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:05,768
To...

166
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:08,062
bookmark it.

167
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,940
If that doesn't work,

168
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:14,110
you know the print screen key?

169
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:15,820
Yeah, this one?

170
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,322
Try pressing it.

171
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,075
If it doesn't work...

172
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,454
Print screen key.

173
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:27,373
Press the...

174
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,168
Print screen...

175
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:31,461
Got it.

176
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:32,921
Let me know?

177
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:34,172
Sure.

178
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,092
See you.

179
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:04,911
Don't bother with that, Mom.

180
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:06,913
What? Sure.

181
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:16,798
Are you eating this junk again?

182
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:19,300
It's not good for you.

183
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:26,891
I'm going now.

184
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,604
Have you called your father?

185
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:32,814
Nope.

186
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:37,318
I see...
but what if you get in trouble?

187
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,363
I can't rush over.

188
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:45,994
It's awkward for me to see him,
but you should.

189
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,663
Forget it.
He's out of the picture.

190
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,207
He lives here in Tokyo.

191
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,209
But Tokyo's huge.

192
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,003
I know, but...

193
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:57,547
I'm fine. I've got my friends.

194
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,842
You sure?
I guess you'll be all right then.

195
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,720
You're so trusting
and get carried away...

196
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,394
Hello.

197
00:23:15,064 --> 00:23:16,190
Hello.

198
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,443
Help...

199
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:21,863
Help...

200
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:26,951
Help...

201
00:23:27,368 --> 00:23:28,661
Who's this?

202
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,205
Help...

203
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:01,587
What is this...

204
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:03,631
The Forbidden Room

205
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,173
Taguchi?

206
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,885
What happened, Taguchi...

207
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,140
What?

208
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,477
What am I saying?

209
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:20,262
What happened to Yabe?

210
00:29:22,348 --> 00:29:23,808
Try his house?

211
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,185
No answer.

212
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:28,104
Huh...

213
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:30,439
I hope nothing's wrong.

214
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,655
Oh, no. What's he up to?

215
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,991
I've got to go see him.

216
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:43,327
No! Don't go!

217
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:46,330
He'll turn up. He'll come if we wait!

218
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:49,291
Nothing strange has happened yet.

219
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:51,627
Yeah...

220
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:54,004
Let's just act normal.

221
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:58,134
Yeah, at least for today.

222
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:19,864
Sorry, I'm late.

223
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:21,824
Sure, sure.

224
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:25,327
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

225
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,288
Hey!

226
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:34,378
Can you believe, he's ignoring us!

227
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,255
What's going on?

228
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:38,716
Who cares...

229
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,267
What do I do now?

230
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,269
Click it...

231
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:57,646
and bookmark it.

232
00:32:58,731 --> 00:32:59,940
Doesn't work.

233
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,903
If that doesn't work,
press the print screen key.

234
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:13,329
There.

235
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:09,528
Hi.

236
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,947
You're the one...

237
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:14,533
Um...

238
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,869
Kawashima.

239
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:18,620
Kawashima.

240
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:19,872
Yeah, Kawashima.

241
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm Karasawa Harue.

242
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,919
Harue-san, Harue-san.

243
00:35:32,468 --> 00:35:33,761
How'd it go?

244
00:35:34,136 --> 00:35:36,805
Well, it came back again.

245
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:37,973
Really?

246
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:39,391
Yeah.

247
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:42,227
And...

248
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:46,607
I pressed that print screen key...

249
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:51,361
Right.

250
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:54,990
Can I come over and check it out?

251
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:58,619
Yeah, sure, absolutely fine.

252
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:00,871
I just need a minute.

253
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:29,107
Um...

254
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:33,111
What's this?

255
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:39,201
That? Something we programmed here.

256
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:44,706
If two dots get too close, they die,

257
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,293
but if they get too far apart,
they're drawn closer.

258
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:52,047
Huh... what's it for?

259
00:36:57,302 --> 00:37:00,347
A miniature model of our world...

260
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:06,770
But only the grad student
who designed it understands it.

261
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,620
I wouldn't...

262
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,418
suggest staring at it for too long.

263
00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:41,179
Sorry, it's a mess.

264
00:37:42,014 --> 00:37:43,056
Thank you.

265
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:56,028
There you go.

266
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:57,446
Thank you.

267
00:37:59,823 --> 00:38:01,491
Getting the data?

268
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:03,243
Yeah, almost set.

269
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:33,398
What got you started on the internet?

270
00:38:34,107 --> 00:38:37,694
Nothing in particular...

271
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:41,490
You don't like computers, right?

272
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:42,532
No.

273
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:47,120
Wanted to connect with other people?

274
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:52,626
Maybe... I don't know.

275
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:55,504
Everybody else is into it.

276
00:38:57,631 --> 00:39:00,550
People don't really connect, you know.

277
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:01,677
What?

278
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,765
Like those dots simulating humans.

279
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,518
We all live totally separately.

280
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,400
That's how it seems to me.

281
00:39:17,401 --> 00:39:18,652
Oh... Huh...

282
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:21,238
I wonder...

283
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,210
Yabe...

284
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:42,259
Kudo-san.

285
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:43,635
Yes.

286
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,556
Can you move these orchids
into the greenhouse?

287
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:50,267
Yes.

288
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:03,739
Um, boss...

289
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:04,781
Yes?

290
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:08,160
Isn't Yabe acting strange?

291
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:10,078
You think so?

292
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:13,457
Can I go check on him?

293
00:40:13,832 --> 00:40:15,542
Fine, but...

294
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:19,296
It might be a waste of time.

295
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:26,970
Words said in friendship with
the best of intentions...

296
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:32,059
always wind up
hurting your friends deeply.

297
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,896
And then you wind up getting hurt.

298
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,818
Is friendship always that way?

299
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:44,821
If that's so, what's left?

300
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,075
If I were you...

301
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:57,167
Who needs friends like that?

302
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:02,047
A courageous choice in itself.

303
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,945
Are you okay?

304
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:31,076
Did something happen?

305
00:41:35,455 --> 00:41:38,125
If something happened,
let's talk about it.

306
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,760
Both Junco and I ...

307
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:51,555
are really worried.

308
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,143
I saw...

309
00:41:57,144 --> 00:41:58,520
A face...

310
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:00,230
What?

311
00:42:01,273 --> 00:42:02,899
A horrible face...

312
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:09,489
I've never seen anything like it...

313
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:13,285
What are you saying?
What did you see?

314
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,539
The Forbidden Room.

315
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:20,375
Forbidden Room? What's that?

316
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:26,798
Is that...

317
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:30,093
the room with the red tape?

318
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:31,845
Don't dare go in there!

319
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,060
Please...

320
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,563
tell me.

321
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:44,524
What happened?

322
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,993
I'm cold.

323
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,210
Yabe...

324
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:08,673
Are you okay?

325
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,199
Exit

326
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:41,701
Harue.

327
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:45,372
Hi.

328
00:45:49,084 --> 00:45:52,420
I don't really use the library much.

329
00:45:52,504 --> 00:45:54,672
Couldn't find the way out.

330
00:45:59,094 --> 00:46:01,221
Phantoms

331
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:05,517
You reading this?

332
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:07,352
Yeah.

333
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:10,855
Is it related to your
work in the lab?

334
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,692
Yeah.

335
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:16,778
Huh...

336
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:22,367
Do you have a minute?

337
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:25,662
What? Sure.

338
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,039
Come.

339
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:46,975
Isn't it strange?

340
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:50,687
Yeah... sort of...

341
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:02,824
Almost like ghosts, right?

342
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,328
You're right, they're like ghosts.

343
00:47:10,582 --> 00:47:13,960
Sometimes, these turn up.

344
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:17,505
At first, they look
like the other dots.

345
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:20,800
What are they?

346
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,178
I don't know.

347
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:26,389
A bug?

348
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,099
No.

349
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:48,786
That website...

350
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,996
What?

351
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:54,626
Oh, what happened with that?

352
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,128
Nothing... yet...

353
00:47:58,046 --> 00:47:59,214
Huh...

354
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:01,883
But I think they're related

355
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:06,554
I'm sure they're related.

356
00:48:07,764 --> 00:48:09,057
You think?

357
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:24,322
Let me know if anything happens.

358
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:25,823
Yeah, sure.

359
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,918
Karasawa-san.

360
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:38,920
I need you to check this.

361
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,129
Yes.

362
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:42,715
And you are?

363
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:45,051
My friend, Kawashima.

364
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:46,469
Huh...

365
00:48:47,262 --> 00:48:49,639
The grad student, Yoshizaki-san.

366
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:50,598
Hello.

367
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,789
I forgot to give you my number.

368
00:49:15,707 --> 00:49:16,624
Oh, right.

369
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:18,126
Call me, okay?

370
00:49:19,377 --> 00:49:20,420
Right.

371
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:22,046
Anytime, okay?

372
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,423
Yeah.

373
00:49:23,506 --> 00:49:24,757
Thank you.

374
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:34,350
"Everyone dies, therefore there's no
logical reason for ghosts not to exist.

375
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:40,106
"How many ghosts have...

376
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:43,443
"existed since prehistoric times..."

377
00:50:00,585 --> 00:50:02,128
Do you see it too?

378
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:08,635
Sure you do, because it's really there.

379
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:13,306
Who is that?

380
00:50:14,641 --> 00:50:17,268
You'll have to catch him to find out.

381
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:22,315
Start right now and you might succeed.

382
00:50:26,778 --> 00:50:28,029
Have a go?

383
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,073
What?

384
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:33,284
Why don't you, right now?

385
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:21,082
He disappeared.

386
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,875
I see.

387
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:29,132
He must be a student...
I don't know him.

388
00:51:30,508 --> 00:51:34,011
Maybe you're right.
Sorry I encouraged you.

389
00:51:35,346 --> 00:51:36,389
See you.

390
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,227
Wait a minute.

391
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:47,442
Just what was that?

392
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,753
I'm cold...

393
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:25,104
The spirit...

394
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:29,901
Or consciousness, the soul,
whatever you want to call it,

395
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:34,071
it turns out the realm they
inhabit has a finite capacity.

396
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:39,577
Whether that capacity
accommodates billions or trillions...

397
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,789
eventually, it will run out of space.

398
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:47,168
Once it's filled to the brim...

399
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:51,130
it's got to overflow somehow, somewhere.

400
00:52:52,173 --> 00:52:53,549
But where?

401
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,387
The souls have no choice

402
00:52:58,471 --> 00:53:01,808
but to ooze into another realm,
that is to say, our world.

403
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:05,770
Maybe, at first...

404
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:09,190
it started with something really simple

405
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,799
Once that realm reached critical mass...

406
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:37,885
any device would have sufficed.

407
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:42,139
Thrown it together with
the means and materials at hand.

408
00:53:42,223 --> 00:53:43,641
That's how I see it.

409
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:48,563
Excuse me, do you have any tape?

410
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,775
Anything'll do, some tape.

411
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:55,611
How's this?

412
00:53:56,779 --> 00:53:57,822
Thank you.

413
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:31,647
After many hours or days...

414
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,068
or many weeks, it finally happens.

415
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:29,830
Through that process,
it spread around the world.

416
00:55:29,914 --> 00:55:33,834
But now they're no longer
the faint presence they began as.

417
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:37,338
You saw one yourself.

418
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,387
I don't believe your stories.

419
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,807
Right, sorry, it's all hypothetical.

420
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,522
Thanks for the tea.

421
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:55,815
Are you okay?

422
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,358
Just fine.

423
00:55:58,401 --> 00:56:00,820
But if this really happened,

424
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,989
there's no turning back.

425
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:06,993
No matter how simple the device,

426
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:11,163
once the system's complete,
it'll function on its own...

427
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,582
and become permanent.

428
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,793
In other words...

429
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,380
the passage is now open...
that's how it looks.

430
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,122
Hello.

431
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:56,500
Oh, I see, our boss isn't there?

432
00:56:57,585 --> 00:56:59,837
Yes, I understand.

433
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,548
If he does stop by,

434
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:05,843
will you please ask him to call us?

435
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:09,597
Yes, thank you very much.

436
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,937
Michi...

437
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:21,734
what do you think's going on?

438
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,701
Why's everyone disappearing?

439
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:50,221
Oh, hello.
This is Sunny Plant Sales calling.

440
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,349
Thank you for your business.

441
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:57,186
Is our boss there with you
by any chance?

442
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:03,109
Oh, I see... Thank you, and excuse me.

443
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:08,948
I'll go look for him.

444
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,659
Wait, Junco, wait.

445
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,208
Yes, hello...

446
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:24,672
Boss?

447
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:27,508
Help.

448
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:30,678
Yabe!

449
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:34,306
Are you Yabe?

450
00:58:37,393 --> 00:58:38,853
Yabe!

451
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,823
Help me...

452
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,628
Help me...

453
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:09,592
Help...

454
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,638
Help...

455
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:36,202
Junco...

456
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:39,872
Junco!

457
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:17,284
Junco, no!

458
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,414
Junco!

459
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:28,712
Are you okay?

460
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:31,298
Are you okay?

461
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:58,575
Junco.

462
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,593
Help me...

463
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,720
Help me...

464
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:01,930
Help me...

465
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:09,355
Junco!

466
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:12,024
Look, I'm right here.

467
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:15,527
I'm right here, it's okay.

468
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:42,471
Excuse me.

469
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:17,089
Karasawa Harue
tel. : 090-4079-2677

470
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:03,255
What are you doing, Harue!

471
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:07,426
You're dripping wet!

472
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:09,970
They went away...

473
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:13,473
They've all disappeared...
They always do...

474
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:14,933
I have to run away...

475
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,185
Run away somewhere...

476
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:21,982
Harue!

477
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:24,776
Hey, Harue!

478
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,778
Listen, Harue!

479
01:06:27,571 --> 01:06:28,822
Harue!

480
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:31,617
Calm down! Harue!

481
01:06:53,305 --> 01:06:54,640
Thank you...

482
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:29,091
I always wondered
what it's like to die...

483
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:32,135
From when I was really little...

484
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,931
I was always alone.

485
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,892
Any parents or family?

486
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:42,479
Sure, but they're irrelevant.

487
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:45,190
Right...

488
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:50,612
That after death...

489
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:54,491
you live happily with
everyone over there.

490
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:57,077
Can we stop talking about this?

491
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,912
But it may be true.

492
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:02,290
Sure, but...

493
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,878
Then in high school it dawned on me...

494
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,217
you might be all alone
after death, too.

495
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:18,306
There's no way to know.

496
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:20,267
How could you?

497
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:23,937
The idea was so terrifying.

498
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:27,607
I couldn't even bear it.

499
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:31,695
That nothing changes with death,

500
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:34,197
just right now, forever.

501
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:44,291
Is that what becoming
a ghost is about?

502
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:49,546
You can't mess with that.
It's really bad.

503
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:53,133
What have ghosts got to do with us?

504
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:55,010
Besides, we're alive.

505
01:08:57,637 --> 01:09:00,015
Then, who are they?

506
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:10,817
Are they really alive?

507
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:15,739
How are they different from ghosts?

508
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:26,333
In fact...

509
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,836
ghosts and people are the same...

510
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:33,632
whether they're dead or alive.

511
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:41,139
It's not right. It's wrong.

512
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:43,642
They're all crazy.

513
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,439
Nobody knows what happens
when you die.

514
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:53,693
All this about ghosts, but I won't
believe in them, even if I see one.

515
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:55,862
But I do know...

516
01:09:56,947 --> 01:10:01,827
that I'm definitely alive
and so are you, Harue.

517
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,745
That's for sure, right?

518
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:09,709
So I don't want to think about
the fact we'll die someday.

519
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,713
Just maybe...

520
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:17,551
in 10 years, or at least
while we're still alive...

521
01:10:18,009 --> 01:10:20,679
they'll invent a drug
that prevents death.

522
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:23,890
Then, we could live forever and ever.

523
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:28,728
Of course you might think
I'm crazy to say that, but...

524
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:31,356
I'd rather bet on that.

525
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:35,610
You want to live forever?

526
01:10:36,278 --> 01:10:37,404
Yeah.

527
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:40,448
That sounds like fun?

528
01:10:41,032 --> 01:10:43,618
Yeah... That's what I think.

529
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:54,462
Huh... Maybe I've got it all wrong.

530
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:00,302
No...

531
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:06,266
It'll turn out just like you say.

532
01:11:09,227 --> 01:11:10,437
I'm sure.

533
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:12,522
What?

534
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,653
Ghosts won't kill people.

535
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,408
Because that would just
make more ghosts.

536
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:27,162
Isn't that right?

537
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:34,336
Instead, they'll try
to make people immortal.

538
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:40,342
By quietly...

539
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,680
trapping them in their own loneliness.

540
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:57,150
Help...

541
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:01,613
Help...

542
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:08,888
Junco, it'll be okay.

543
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,599
It'll be okay.

544
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,060
Okay...

545
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:34,789
I fell asleep...

546
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:41,004
How do you feel?

547
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:42,589
Yeah.

548
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:46,801
Something to drink?
How about some coffee?

549
01:14:00,732 --> 01:14:01,816
Michi...

550
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:03,943
What?

551
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:08,948
Am I just going to die like this?

552
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,119
Of course not.

553
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:16,706
That's right...

554
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:20,001
I'll just keep on living, all alone...

555
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:44,275
What?

556
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:46,569
No.

557
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:21,563
Junco!

558
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:24,607
Junco.

559
01:15:26,276 --> 01:15:27,569
Junco!

560
01:15:43,501 --> 01:15:44,961
Junco!

561
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,051
Why! Why!

562
01:16:01,352 --> 01:16:03,813
Junco, don't go!

563
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:06,232
Junco.

564
01:16:56,366 --> 01:16:57,659
Mother?

565
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,248
Mother?

566
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:07,627
Mother!

567
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:15,009
I'll be right there.

568
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:51,833
Harue...

569
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:57,964
Harue! Hey...

570
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:06,389
Kawashima... take me with you.

571
01:20:11,352 --> 01:20:13,312
I'm scared to be alone.

572
01:20:19,485 --> 01:20:21,237
Take me somewhere.

573
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,252
Okay, sure.

574
01:20:38,379 --> 01:20:39,422
Where to?

575
01:20:39,505 --> 01:20:41,090
Somewhere far away.

576
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,594
Out of Order

577
01:20:44,677 --> 01:20:46,929
Shit, let's just go!

578
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:28,638
There's no one...

579
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:33,017
No...

580
01:21:39,774 --> 01:21:41,734
Where did everyone go?

581
01:21:46,572 --> 01:21:48,032
I'm here.

582
01:21:53,246 --> 01:21:55,206
I'm here beside you.

583
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:01,754
Even if...

584
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:06,175
there's no one else,
it doesn't matter.

585
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:11,389
We are both definitely here.

586
01:22:19,855 --> 01:22:21,357
Guess that's true...

587
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,390
What happened!

588
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:01,689
I've got to go back!

589
01:23:01,772 --> 01:23:04,567
What? No! We've come this far!

590
01:23:05,151 --> 01:23:07,653
But this is the end of the line.

591
01:23:07,737 --> 01:23:10,698
That's not true.
It'll start moving.

592
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:13,409
I'll go check with the driver.
Come with me.

593
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,872
Okay, but promise
you'll wait right here.

594
01:23:17,955 --> 01:23:19,874
I'll be right back.
Promise.

595
01:23:58,079 --> 01:23:59,288
Harue!

596
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:10,067
The Forbidden Room

597
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:19,720
Construction Materials - red tape

598
01:28:11,707 --> 01:28:13,000
I'm...

599
01:28:16,837 --> 01:28:18,505
Not alone...

600
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:39,276
Harue,

601
01:28:39,693 --> 01:28:41,654
it's me, Kawashima.

602
01:28:45,324 --> 01:28:47,117
Harue! Listen!

603
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:52,998
Listen, what do you say to this...

604
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:55,960
The two of us live together.

605
01:28:56,377 --> 01:28:59,129
That way, we can always be together.

606
01:29:00,422 --> 01:29:03,467
If we keep living alone,

607
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,929
we'll get worse and worse
because we're weak.

608
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:09,598
We'll balance each other out.

609
01:29:10,182 --> 01:29:12,017
How 'bout living that way?

610
01:29:12,935 --> 01:29:14,979
Would you try it with me?

611
01:29:15,062 --> 01:29:18,065
What do you think, Harue? Listen!

612
01:29:27,574 --> 01:29:28,492
Harue!

613
01:29:29,827 --> 01:29:30,828
Harue!

614
01:29:32,705 --> 01:29:33,789
Harue!

615
01:29:43,298 --> 01:29:46,552
Tokyo: Missing

624
01:31:05,881 --> 01:31:08,092
Um... are you okay?

625
01:31:14,807 --> 01:31:15,933
Breakdown?

626
01:31:18,644 --> 01:31:19,520
Yeah.

627
01:31:19,895 --> 01:31:21,021
Want some?

628
01:31:31,698 --> 01:31:32,574
You are?

629
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:35,828
Oh, me? Um...

630
01:31:38,539 --> 01:31:39,665
What are you doing here?

631
01:31:43,293 --> 01:31:45,170
What am I doing here...

632
01:31:48,048 --> 01:31:48,924
You?

633
01:31:56,723 --> 01:31:59,393
So neither your dad nor your mum...

634
01:31:59,935 --> 01:32:01,645
made it through...

635
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:03,313
No...

636
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:07,317
So many things happened at once...

637
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:10,654
it's impossible to sort them all out.

638
01:32:11,697 --> 01:32:12,698
Yeah.

639
01:32:16,118 --> 01:32:19,580
Me too. My head's all messed up.

640
01:32:20,664 --> 01:32:24,042
So you're a student, Kawashima?

641
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:25,169
Yeah.

642
01:32:26,545 --> 01:32:27,713
Lucky you.

643
01:32:27,796 --> 01:32:29,715
I don't think so.

644
01:32:29,798 --> 01:32:30,674
Here.

645
01:32:30,757 --> 01:32:32,509
Oh, thanks...

646
01:32:36,096 --> 01:32:37,347
And you?

647
01:32:37,973 --> 01:32:39,349
I had a job.

648
01:32:39,683 --> 01:32:41,685
Wow, amazing.

649
01:32:41,768 --> 01:32:43,187
Nothing amazing.

650
01:32:46,273 --> 01:32:48,609
Did you have any friends?

651
01:32:49,443 --> 01:32:50,569
Friends?

652
01:32:53,655 --> 01:32:55,240
Maybe one, I guess.

653
01:32:55,949 --> 01:32:57,409
What was she like?

654
01:33:00,954 --> 01:33:02,664
What? I don't really know...

655
01:33:04,917 --> 01:33:07,085
I never really found out...

656
01:33:07,711 --> 01:33:09,213
Where is she?

657
01:33:10,172 --> 01:33:11,465
Somewhere...

658
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:16,678
Okay, try starting it.

659
01:33:28,357 --> 01:33:30,067
Okay, good.

660
01:33:47,751 --> 01:33:49,628
Why don't you look for her?

661
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:50,712
What?

662
01:33:51,964 --> 01:33:55,842
She's still somewhere, right?
You've got to help her then.

663
01:33:58,011 --> 01:33:59,096
But...

664
01:34:00,472 --> 01:34:03,433
Let's go find her. I'll help you.

665
01:34:10,107 --> 01:34:12,567
This is the last stop...

666
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:20,659
After that we go as far as we can.

667
01:34:25,872 --> 01:34:28,959
I can sort of see...

668
01:34:30,377 --> 01:34:31,253
The future...

669
01:34:41,888 --> 01:34:45,183
Help Help Help Help Help

670
01:35:09,124 --> 01:35:10,584
Look over there.

671
01:35:14,087 --> 01:35:15,881
An abandoned factory?

672
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:24,348
I wonder...

673
01:35:26,808 --> 01:35:28,143
Shall we try it?

674
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:51,291
Listen, even if you see
a door sealed with red tape,

675
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:53,960
don't go near it, okay?

676
01:35:54,586 --> 01:35:55,837
I know.

677
01:36:20,487 --> 01:36:21,530
You okay?

678
01:36:59,943 --> 01:37:02,446
Look... at this.

679
01:37:13,081 --> 01:37:14,708
Look... over there.

680
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,652
Kawashima.

681
01:37:43,069 --> 01:37:44,279
Harue!

682
01:37:44,779 --> 01:37:45,906
Watch out!

683
01:37:48,283 --> 01:37:50,035
What happened, Harue!

684
01:37:50,785 --> 01:37:53,205
What are you doing with that?

685
01:37:57,334 --> 01:38:01,171
Let's get out of this place together.

686
01:38:03,673 --> 01:38:05,258
Together?

687
01:38:06,092 --> 01:38:07,177
Yeah.

688
01:38:20,273 --> 01:38:21,900
C'mon, hand it over.

689
01:38:21,983 --> 01:38:23,568
Harue! Harue!

690
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:30,033
Oh, no, a hospital...

691
01:38:42,837 --> 01:38:45,048
Harue! Don't die!

692
01:38:45,423 --> 01:38:47,425
C'mon! Please!

693
01:38:49,177 --> 01:38:50,345
Help me!

694
01:38:53,515 --> 01:38:54,558
Harue!

695
01:39:08,446 --> 01:39:10,365
We couldn't save her...

696
01:39:12,742 --> 01:39:13,868
No...

697
01:39:37,976 --> 01:39:39,769
We're out of gas...

698
01:39:41,438 --> 01:39:44,274
I'll get some, there was gas back there.

699
01:39:44,357 --> 01:39:45,609
You'll be okay?

700
01:39:46,526 --> 01:39:48,320
Wait for me. I'll be okay.

701
01:41:45,687 --> 01:41:47,105
Forever...

702
01:41:49,649 --> 01:41:51,776
Death was...

703
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:54,612
Eternal loneliness...

704
01:42:03,204 --> 01:42:04,622
Help.

705
01:42:05,957 --> 01:42:07,375
Help.

706
01:42:08,501 --> 01:42:10,086
Help.

707
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:14,132
Don't ask me!
What's that got to do with me!

708
01:42:15,717 --> 01:42:17,260
Forever...

709
01:42:18,136 --> 01:42:19,846
Death was...

710
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:22,474
Eternal loneliness...

711
01:42:30,398 --> 01:42:32,150
You're not real.

712
01:42:33,777 --> 01:42:36,780
I refuse to acknowledge... Never...

713
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:39,783
I refuse to acknowledge death!

714
01:43:24,786 --> 01:43:26,120
I know.

715
01:43:27,831 --> 01:43:29,582
I'll catch you.

716
01:43:30,458 --> 01:43:32,502
Then you'll disappear.

717
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,256
That's it, right! Right!

718
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:39,634
You can't beat me!

719
01:44:08,913 --> 01:44:10,498
I am...

720
01:44:13,376 --> 01:44:15,628
Real...

721
01:46:10,535 --> 01:46:11,911
Kawashima!

722
01:46:19,335 --> 01:46:20,503
What is it?

723
01:46:20,586 --> 01:46:23,047
Forget it... Let's go...

724
01:48:38,474 --> 01:48:40,226
It's too much...

725
01:48:52,572 --> 01:48:55,950
What... are you doing?

726
01:49:02,331 --> 01:49:05,751
You went in there...

727
01:49:07,587 --> 01:49:08,671
Me?

728
01:49:10,673 --> 01:49:12,884
Yeah, I did, but I'm fine.

729
01:49:28,191 --> 01:49:29,692
Don't cry.

730
01:49:53,507 --> 01:49:55,051
You want to go back?

731
01:49:56,344 --> 01:49:58,262
To what's left of Harue?

732
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:06,312
That make you feel better?

733
01:50:11,817 --> 01:50:15,404
I that's what you want,
I'll go with you.

734
01:50:19,116 --> 01:50:20,284
No...

735
01:50:21,702 --> 01:50:23,079
Let's go...

736
01:50:24,038 --> 01:50:25,957
As far as we can go.

737
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:32,588
Are you sure about that?

738
01:50:39,053 --> 01:50:40,137
Yeah.

739
01:50:58,823 --> 01:51:00,032
Can you get out?

740
01:51:07,707 --> 01:51:08,666
You okay?

741
01:51:21,804 --> 01:51:23,097
Be careful.

742
01:51:34,025 --> 01:51:35,443
Wait here, okay?

743
01:52:50,393 --> 01:52:53,687
Death comes to us all...

744
01:52:54,605 --> 01:52:58,484
If so, maybe we would've been happier

745
01:52:58,567 --> 01:53:01,070
if we had gone with the rest.

746
01:53:01,779 --> 01:53:04,907
But we chose to keep going...

747
01:53:05,616 --> 01:53:08,077
into the future...

748
01:53:27,388 --> 01:53:29,723
We'll head for Latin America.

749
01:53:30,224 --> 01:53:33,060
We're still getting signals there.

750
01:53:33,811 --> 01:53:35,855
Though they're pretty weak.

751
01:53:37,189 --> 01:53:39,191
We've got to give it a try...

752
01:53:40,443 --> 01:53:42,319
no matter what we find.

753
01:53:45,573 --> 01:53:48,617
If anyone's survived...

754
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:51,036
we can head out again...

755

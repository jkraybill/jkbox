00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,583
PATHÉ and The Criterion Collection present
a 2022 restoration

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,375
<i>Le Samouraï</i> was restored in 4K
from the original camera negative,

3
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:24,333
which included some internegative parts.
Also and interpositive was used.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,708
The sound was restored
from the 35mm magnetic track.

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,958
The color correction
was supervised by Bruno Nuytten.

6
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:49,958
THE SAMURAI

7
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:06,542
THERE IS NO GREATER SOLITUDE
THAN THAT OF THE SAMURAI,

8
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:11,375
UNLESS IT IS THAT
OF THE TIGER IN THE JUNGLE...

9
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,500
PERHAPS...

10
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,292
BUSHIDO (BOOK OF THE SAMURAI)

11
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:54,917
SATURDAY, APRIL 4
6:00 P.M.

12
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,125
Jef?

13
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,000
Tonight I got here at 7:15
and left at 2:00 a.m.

14
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,792
Impossible. Wiener just got back.
He phoned to say he's coming at 2:O0.

15
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,417
Then I was here
from 7:15 to 1:45.

16
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,208
I like when you come here,
because you need me.

17
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,625
Call.

18
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,500
How long will you be here?

19
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,917
We rented the room for the night.

20
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,917
I'll be here at 2:00.
Save me a seat.

21
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,375
Bring cash, in case you lose.

22
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,292
I never lose.

23
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,167
Not really.

24
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,000
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

25
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,500
What do you want?

26
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,833
To kill you.

27
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,833
General alert.
Routine round up.

28
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,542
Identity checks all night.

29
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,750
The killer is described as tall,
young, wearing a raincoat and a hat.

30
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,417
I want at least 20 suspects
from every precinct.

31
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,833
What's 400 suspects
in a city of 10 million?

32
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,833
Get a move on.
In an hour it'll be too late.

33
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,583
Police. Open up.

34
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,417
Identity check.
Your papers, gentlemen.

35
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,625
Your papers, sir.

36
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,125
How long have you been here?

37
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,625
Since 19:00.

38
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,750
Thank you.

39
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,083
Papers, please.
And you?

40
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,167
Since 21 :00... 21:15.

41
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,458
Your livelihood?

42
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,708
I get a full pension, sir.
I'm a disabled veteran.

43
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,292
Your papers, sir.

44
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,583
When did you get here?

45
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,417
At 2:00... 2:15.

46
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,167
Come with us for a routine check.

47
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,458
If you make a legitimate living,
you'll be released at once.

48
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:39,500
Let's move it.

49
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,417
Silence!

50
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,750
Damolini, Ange Sėraphin.

51
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:22,042
Gros Caillou precinct. Age 41.
Picked up in a bar

52
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,958
on Ave Bosquet,
with a .32 automatic.

53
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,750
Take off your glasses.

54
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,792
What have you got to say?

55
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,167
Me? Nothing at all.

56
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,208
You were carrying a gun.

57
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,583
For what purpose?

58
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,458
Next.

59
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,417
This way.

60
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,542
Garcia, Juan, age 47,

61
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,167
and Delbarre, Jeanne, age 51.

62
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,417
Picked up near Austerlitz station.

63
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,917
Man carrying a .32 automatic.

64
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,458
Take off your hat.

65
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,375
- You're not married?
- No.

66
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,833
Living together?

67
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,167
Yes.

68
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:24,750
Why the gun?

69
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,000
Paris streets ain't safe at night.

70
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,625
It's just for self-defense.

71
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,750
I'll read your record:

72
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:37,833
"1945, six-month prison sentence
for inciting a minor to debauchery.

73
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,042
1950, 12-month sentence
for drug trafficking.

74
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,500
1952, attempted burglary.

75
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,208
1955, new sentence for procuring.

76
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:48,750
1958, attempted murder.

77
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:52,583
1960, manslaughter.
Given the benefit of the doubt."

78
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,375
Well?

79
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:05,375
Next.

80
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,208
Costello, Jef. Age 30.

81
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,875
No criminal record.
Fits the description.

82
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,167
Not carrying any firearms.

83
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,375
The man wore a hat.

84
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,792
Put on your hat.

85
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,583
It wasn't a hat like that.

86
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,917
The hat he wore...

87
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,500
...was darker.

88
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,542
No, it was a light hat.

89
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,333
But he had a mustache.
I think.

90
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,417
Why'd you shave your mustache off?

91
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,667
I've never had a mustache.

92
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,333
I don't think it's him.

93
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,250
No, it's certainly not him.

94
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,667
Excuse me, but I say it's him.

95
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,458
I distinctly remember the silhouette.

96
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,583
And you?

97
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,833
Yes, of course,
it could be him.

98
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:22,750
Where were you
between 12:00 and 2:00?

99
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,042
At my girlfriend's.

100
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,042
The lucky lady's name
and phone number?

101
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,667
Is it necessary?

102
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,542
Asuspect without an alibi
stays here.

103
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,042
Jane Lagrange,
11 Avenue Amiral Bruix.

104
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:46,375
- Phone number?
- MacMahon 91-73.

105
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,792
Miss Lagrange, please.

106
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,042
Miss Lagrange alone.

107
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,833
Apart from the man outside
whom we found at your apartment,

108
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:42,542
did you have
another visitor last night?

109
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,083
We're not investigating
your private life.

110
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,167
You can see whom you like,
when you like.

111
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,333
That's not an offense.

112
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:58,667
I just want to know if, before
Mr. Wiener arrived at 2:00 a.m.,

113
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,250
you had another visitor.

114
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:04,125
Yes.

115
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,625
Until what time and who?

116
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:12,042
Until 1:45. A man.

117
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:16,750
So I understood.
Same age as Mr. Wiener?

118
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:19,708
No, younger.

119
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,875
Thirtyish?

120
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,333
Yes, thirtyish.

121
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,792
From what time to what time?

122
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,750
From about 7:15 until 1:45.

123
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,917
How did you know it was 1:45?

124
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,875
I made him leave.
I expected Mr. Wiener at 2:00.

125
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,583
I understand.

126
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,750
And now one last verification.

127
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,167
The man's name?

128
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:54,375
Must I answer?

129
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,875
Yes, you must.

130
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,042
Jef Costello.

131
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,667
Excuse me a moment, please.

132
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:23,042
He didn't say he knew the victim?

133
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:28,917
- Why didn't you mention that?
- It's not true.

134
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,917
You'll have to prove that.

135
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,083
No, it's up to you
to prove the contrary.

136
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
What you can't deny...

137
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,083
for very long anyway...

138
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,375
are your regular visits
to his club.

139
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,292
I never set foot in there.

140
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,917
What exactly are you after?

141
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,375
Jef Costello's confession
to a crime he didn't commit?

142
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,250
Isn't that going too far?

143
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:58,792
I'm about to make
you change your tune.

144
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,667
Call you back.

145
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,208
Bring Wiener straight in here.

146
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:27,333
You arrived at Miss Lagrange's
apartment at 2:00 or 2:15?

147
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,750
That's right.

148
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,750
Think carefully before you answer.

149
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,417
Did you have the feeling
upon entering her apartment

150
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,667
that someone had just left?

151
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,875
Forgive me for being so blunt,

152
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:50,542
but didn't you feel your spot
was still warm?

153
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:51,917
Excuse me?

154
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,667
I have to insist.

155
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,042
I'm not very observant.

156
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,792
That's everyone's loss.

157
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,875
But I do remember something.

158
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:09,417
As I entered the building,
someone turned on the light.

159
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:14,458
I saw a man on his way out.
He walked past me.

160
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:21,292
Come to think of it, he was
a few feet from Miss Lagrange's door.

161
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,000
He might've been coming out.

162
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,875
Could you recognize him?

163
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,583
No, I don't think so.

164
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,917
Let me try something.

165
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:47,458
Put on your coats and hats
and line up in three rows.

166
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,333
Come with me.

167
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,458
Stand over there.

168
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,417
Switch coats with him.

169
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,167
And you switch hats.

170
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,875
Come this way, please.

171
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:11,667
Do you recognize the man you saw
at 2:00 a.m. in Miss Lagrange's lobby?

172
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,542
Do you recognize anyone?

173
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,667
I have a composite image
of the man I passed.

174
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,375
A trench coat like that one.

175
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,375
A hat like this one,

176
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,500
or that one.

177
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,167
And a face like his.

178
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:26,125
Just imagine
if you were observant!

179
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,583
Come with me, please.

180
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:37,667
That's it.

181
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:59,583
I must ask you both to forgive me.

182
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:02,375
Our job leaves no room for etiquette.

183
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,583
Can I go now?

184
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,292
Of course.

185
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,417
So much for people's private lives!

186
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,625
I'm investigating a homicide.

187
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:25,250
I have no choice when dealing
with a suspect. Every minute counts.

188
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,708
Can I go now too?

189
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,000
Of course.

190
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,750
Take the lady home.

191
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,708
I'd like you to take
one more look at Costello.

192
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,500
Try to be certain.

193
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,542
No "maybe" or "I think."

194
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:04,667
"Yes, it's him,"
or "No, it's not him." Understood?

195
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,000
Bring him in.

196
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:22,500
Do you recognize this man?

197
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:26,875
Did you see him come out
of the office hallway?

198
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,583
Yes or no.

199
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:31,250
No, absolutely not.

200
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,333
Thank you.
Step into my office.

201
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:40,250
Sir?

202
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:45,708
Do you still recognize him as the man
who came out of the hallway?

203
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,458
I can answer unequivocally.

204
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,042
That's what I'm asking you to do.

205
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,000
The answer is yes.

206
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,333
Step into my office.

207
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:04,125
Do you recognize this man?

208
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,708
No. Frankly, I don't think so.

209
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:11,708
Step into my office.

210
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:17,875
Same question.

211
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:21,667
I'm not sure now.
I didn't see the man long enough.

212
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,792
Step into my office.

213
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,375
Miss?

214
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,500
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

215
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:38,958
I can't give you
a definitive answer.

216
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,917
Thank you.
Step into my office.

217
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,292
Now, ma'am,
you're the only witness

218
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,792
who actually saw Martey's killer.

219
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:59,208
You were a few feet from him.
I can hold him and destroy his alibi,

220
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,958
since he was formally
recognized by a witness,

221
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,417
or he walks out of here
a free man on your word...

222
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,542
and that's the end of it.

223
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,833
There's not the slightest doubt
in my mind.

224
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,500
It's definitely not him.

225
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,583
Thank you, ma'am.

226
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,500
It's the least I can do.

227
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,625
Thank you, miss.

228
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:30,708
Gentlemen, step outside.

229
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,583
SUNDAY, 5:45 A.M.

230
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,833
Can I go now?

231
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,250
I'm afraid so.

232
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,208
- How many suspects left?
- Nine.

233
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,417
Same procedure for the nine.

234
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,958
That'll take care of our Sunday.

235
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,000
What do you think about Costello?

236
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,042
I never think.

237
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,208
1 Lord Byron Street.

238
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,167
He just entered 1 Lord Byron St.

239
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:47,792
I'll drive around
to the Champs-Elysėes side,

240
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,708
then circle back here
to see if he comes out.

241
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,250
Careful now:
1 Lord Byron St. has two exits.

242
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:57,167
The Champs-Elysėes exit
is at 116b.

243
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,667
- I'll pass it.
- Stay there.

244
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,625
I'll double-park.

245
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,167
He just went into the metro.

246
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,542
Tail him. Try, anyway.

247
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,875
He got away.
What do I do?

248
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,333
As usual when this happens,
report back here.

249
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:07,875
It's done.

250
00:46:08,042 --> 00:46:11,208
I know.
But you were arrested.

251
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,458
It was nothing.

252
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,583
Fine. A promise made...

253
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:22,583
We can't leave him on the loose.

254
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:26,750
He was picked up and held
several hours by Homicide.

255
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,917
The fact they released him
proves nothing.

256
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,875
He might still be a suspect.

257
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:35,167
I doubt it.

258
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,458
He came up with a terrific alibi.

259
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:42,750
- And if it doesn't hold up?
- No way it won't.

260
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:46,542
It's a two-part alibi.
They don't connect.

261
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,292
I admit they don't come
any smarter.

262
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:51,833
That's why we hired him.

263
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:54,042
He carried out the contract:

264
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,833
to kill Martey without a trace.

265
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,333
He's a lone wolf.

266
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,958
Awounded wolf.
He'll leave a trace now.

267
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,750
No, we have to get rid of him,
and quick.

268
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:10,750
Since the police
won't find the killer,

269
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,750
they won't let him off the hook.

270
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:17,833
Despite his alibi,
he's their main witness,

271
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,708
by which I mean
their main suspect.

272
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:26,167
We'll keep on his trail as well.

273
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,917
Make sure he doesn't
give you the slip again.

274
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,083
Not a single clue,
and yet something doesn't fit.

275
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,708
What's that?

276
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,208
I don't know.

277
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,917
He's not normal.

278
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:47,125
I can keep the other suspects
for 48 hours,

279
00:50:47,292 --> 00:50:48,750
but him, no way.

280
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:51,417
- His alibi is airtight.
- Too airtight.

281
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,458
Wiener's absolutely sincere,

282
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,250
but I'm sure the girl's lying.

283
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:02,167
We have to break her
so she talks.

284
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:07,208
Then the DAcan slap
a perjury charge on her.

285
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,417
And little Jef Costello

286
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,750
will be sitting in this chair.

287
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:16,208
He'll just laugh in our faces.

288
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,000
I doubt it.

289
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:26,250
Ever see a guy stay handcuffed
for 48 hours and not open his mouth?

290
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,292
I haven't seen many.

291
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:32,333
Stick with the girl,
but don't lose his trail.

292
00:51:40,417 --> 00:51:43,375
SUNDAY, 10:00 P.M.

293
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,000
- What will you have?
- A whiskey.

294
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,917
If you were the man
wanted by the police,

295
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:54,458
you could say the criminal always
returns to the scene of the crime.

296
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,333
May I get in?

297
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:09,042
Why did you say
you didn't recognize me?

298
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,875
Why did you kill Martey?

299
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:15,542
I was told I'd be paid.

300
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,750
What did he do to you?

301
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,625
Nothing at all.
I didn't even know him.

302
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:25,958
The first and last time I saw him

303
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,167
was 24 hours ago.

304
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:34,750
What kind of man are you?

305
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:45,167
But you knew Martey. Not having
an alibi makes it worse for you.

306
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,333
I was driving back to Paris.

307
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,375
Without witnesses.
You'll have to prove it.

308
01:04:53,542 --> 01:04:54,833
Over here.

309
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:02,167
- The others?
- Nothing.

310
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:06,125
- You'd think informers were on strike.
- Bite your tongue!

311
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:07,375
Something new.

312
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,000
A package Costello dropped
in the gutter.

313
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:14,333
- What's in it?
- Bloody gauze and cotton.

314
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,375
He's wounded.

315
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,833
- Know where he is now?
- Naturally.

316
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:21,708
I have to know who hated Martey
enough to kill him.

317
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,250
Why should you care?

318
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:28,208
At the payoff,
they tried to kill me.

319
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,542
To make sure
it won't happen again,

320
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,833
I have to find them
before they find me.

321
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:39,625
The blond guy I was to meet
on the overpass

322
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,458
didn't leave me much time to think.

323
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:47,208
I'd like to contact him
and his employer.

324
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:50,417
You know them.
They hired you.

325
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,750
No, I only saw a go-between.

326
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:01,083
You didn't identify me
for one of two reasons.

327
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:06,375
Either you enjoyed playing
with the police...

328
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:12,417
or you were told
not to recognize me.

329
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:19,208
Arrested, I'm a threat
to the go-between.

330
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,292
Thus, indirectly, to the man
who ordered the murder.

331
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,167
And?

332
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,875
If he's a friend of yours,
I'll find him through you.

333
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,250
It's 6:10.
Call me here in two hours.

334
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:53,417
MONDAY, 7:OOA.M.

335
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,667
Jef?

336
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:12,750
Yes.

337
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,875
They're just awful.

338
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,875
I can't keep them
from being overzealous.

339
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:50,875
What do you expect?
In the police, promotion means a lot.

340
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:54,958
When I was young,
I was overzealous.

341
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:59,000
- While now you're a fatalist.
- Exactly.

342
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,625
Things go your way or you give up.

343
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:07,250
I don't want to get a confession
or a testimony by strong-arm tactics.

344
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,250
- You don't say.
- I'm very tolerant.

345
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:14,250
I'm all for individual freedom.

346
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,792
Live and let live.

347
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,958
Provided the way one lives

348
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:24,375
doesn't cause harm to others,

349
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:27,208
doesn't disturb the peace,

350
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:30,250
and can in no way be considered

351
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:32,917
an offense against public decency.

352
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:36,958
- Isn't that so?
- Sure. What are you driving at?

353
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:41,083
Simply this:
You declared under oath

354
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,250
that Jef Costello
was here the night of the murder,

355
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:48,708
from about 7:15 p.m.
until 1:45 a.m.

356
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,583
- Is that right?
- Quite right.

357
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:57,083
Let's suppose Costello
wasn't here during those six hours,

358
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,542
and I find out.

359
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:04,333
You'll be indicted for perjury,
contempt of court,

360
01:09:04,542 --> 01:09:07,500
obstruction of justice

361
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,667
and accessory to murder.

362
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:12,708
You'll get at least five years.

363
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,333
Five years is a long time.

364
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,042
Especially for a girl your age.

365
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,417
If I tell you this,

366
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,333
it's because...

367
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:29,417
I have a daughter your age,

368
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,875
and I'd feel really bad.

369
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,125
Would you now?

370
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:35,500
I would.

371
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,042
You're wrong not to believe me.

372
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:40,792
I think you're a nice girl.

373
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:43,500
Avery nice girl.

374
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:48,292
Your behavior
in this proves one thing:

375
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:49,750
You've got pluck.

376
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:54,417
Not many girls would've done
what you did for a friend.

377
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:55,583
Sorry.

378
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:57,875
A boyfriend.

379
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,875
You're above reproach.

380
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,667
But compared with you,
he's no good at all.

381
01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:08,417
- You seen him since?
- No.

382
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,208
I figured as much.

383
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,250
That little louse!

384
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,625
- Know where he is now?
- No.

385
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:19,208
Want to know?

386
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,500
No.

387
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,083
I'll tell you anyway.

388
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:28,250
He's at that pianist's place
from the club.

389
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,708
They've been inseparable
since that night.

390
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,958
Seems like true romance.

391
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:41,500
You don't look too concerned.

392
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:45,500
Don't you love him?

393
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,083
Well, well.

394
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:52,458
I thought you did.

395
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,000
What with all the risks
you took for him,

396
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,875
I thought you must really love him.

397
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:03,042
You're not much of a psychologist.

398
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:04,500
That must be it.

399
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,500
Yet I figured he was your...

400
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,792
What's the word?
Your "soul mate."

401
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:13,750
While the gentleman...

402
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,000
Wiener...

403
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,625
was there to pay the bills.

404
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:25,917
It's strange. Girls like you
are virtually prostitutes.

405
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:29,083
Ever give it any thought?

406
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:35,625
You should.
It could blow up in your face.

407
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,292
If the vice squad
starts in after you...

408
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:42,167
Those boys mean business.

409
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:46,250
You need to be covered.
No pun intended.

410
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,875
And you want to cover me?

411
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:53,708
Even better.

412
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:58,292
I want to help you,
get you out of this.

413
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,125
Your statement.

414
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,958
If you tell me now,
without witnesses,

415
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:08,000
that Costello wasn't here
the night of the murder,

416
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:10,708
I tear it up and we forget it.

417
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:14,458
No perjury charge. Nothing.

418
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And you won't have
to make a new statement.

419
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,708
And the vice squad?

420
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,708
You have my word.
Nothing will happen.

421
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:28,417
I knew you were a smart girl.

422
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:32,250
In other words,
you want me to perjure myself,

423
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:34,667
in return for which
I'll be left alone.

424
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:38,917
But if I stick to the truth
and get in your way,

425
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:42,125
then I won't heart he end of it.
Is that it?

426
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:44,042
Not quite.

427
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:50,625
The truth is not what you say.

428
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,958
It's what I say.

429
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,333
Whatever the methods I use
to get to it.

430
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,042
So then...

431
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:04,875
is it yes?

432
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:12,917
It's no.

433
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:27,542
As you like.

434
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,083
But we'll meet again.

435
01:19:22,417 --> 01:19:24,750
Hang it up.

436
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,125
We made two mistakes.

437
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:53,583
First was to think
your arrest was a police trap.

438
01:19:53,917 --> 01:19:57,250
Second was to worry
you'd be a threat to us.

439
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,000
That's why I tried to kill you.

440
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:06,833
But we think we need
to make a fresh start.

441
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:37,792
Here's the remainder
of the two million for Martey.

442
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,542
Remember the deal said
no problems.

443
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:47,167
Imagine how we felt
when you were picked up.

444
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,708
Now we want something else.

445
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:57,750
Here's another two million,

446
01:20:59,125 --> 01:21:00,792
in advance this time.

447
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,167
For the same kind of operation.

448
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,542
Another contract.

449
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,917
No answer?

450
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,292
I never talk
to a man holding a gun.

451
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,292
Is that a rule?

452
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,083
A habit.

453
01:21:32,292 --> 01:21:33,250
On your feet.

454
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,792
I'll answer you with a question:
Who sent you?

455
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:43,833
I'm not free to tell you that.

456
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,833
You were free
to kill me on the overpass.

457
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,583
Look at me.

458
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,625
I won't ask you a third time:

459
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,917
Who? Name and address.

460
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:58,667
It's nobody you know.
He isn't someone like us.

461
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:01,583
Don't try my patience.

462
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:06,542
Olivier Rey.

463
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,083
Address?

464
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:11,583
73 Boulevard Montmorency.

465
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,500
That's how you end up out of work.

466
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:26,792
Now about this new contract.

467
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,167
Well...

468
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,833
He found the bug.

469
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,125
He'll be on his guard even more.

470
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:39,583
When he leaves his place,
you're to stick to him like glue.

471
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:42,292
Our plan of attack is ready.

472
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,250
He knows the metro
like the back of his hand.

473
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:48,292
I want flawless surveillance this time.

474
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,625
You're in charge of surface vehicles.

475
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:55,625
You cover the metro. I'll give you
50 men and 20 auxiliaries.

476
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:59,375
You'll all wear
a gallium arsenide transmitter.

477
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:03,000
When you see Costello,
switch to this position.

478
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:05,625
When you lose contact,
this position.

479
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:09,250
If you pick up contact,
switch it back. And so on.

480
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:14,083
I'll stay here as liaison between
the vehicles and the metro unit.

481
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,792
Dismissed.

482
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:35,208
<i>Car 11 ready.</i>

483
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,125
<i>Car 13 ready.</i>

484
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,458
<i>Car 38 ready.</i>

485
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:41,125
<i>Car 41 ready.</i>

486
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:52,167
Here we go.
Contact established.

487
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,792
Contact broken.
He got off at Jourdain.

488
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:30,625
Reestablish contact
at all costs!

489
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:12,375
Acarto Place des Fëtes,
another to Botzaris,

490
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:14,250
a third to Prė-St-Gervais.

491
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:18,000
Message received.
We're on it.

492
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,667
Car 167 to Botzaris.

493
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:25,833
Car 16 to Place des Fëtes.
Car 39 to Pré-St-Gervais.

494
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,375
I was on the wrong side.

495
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,042
- What happened?
- Boss!

496
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,625
- What?
- We lost him.

497
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:33,583
- How?
<i>- On the moving walkway.</i>

498
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,542
He can't have come up yet.
I have a man at each exit.

499
01:32:37,708 --> 01:32:38,500
Got enough men?

500
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:42,500
No, I'm waiting,
but the other cars aren't here yet.

501
01:32:42,667 --> 01:32:45,125
I hope he uses
an exit we have covered.

502
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:47,500
- And the platform?
<i>- Covered.</i>

503
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:14,333
I'm warning you, Jef.
This is the last time.

504
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:16,958
Okay.

505
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:18,500
You heard me?

506
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:21,000
I think I did.
Well, I had a feeling.

507
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:25,125
Maybe it was just because
I wanted you to come.

508
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:30,458
You in trouble?

509
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:34,000
No.

510
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:36,750
Because of me?

511
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:40,333
No.

512
01:36:40,917 --> 01:36:42,792
I've never been in trouble
because of you.

513
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:51,833
They hassled you?

514
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,167
No.

515
01:36:55,792 --> 01:36:56,792
But what about you?

516
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,833
Don't you need me?

517
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,667
- No.
- Yes, you do.

518
01:37:04,667 --> 01:37:06,042
What can I do?

519
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:09,958
What can I do, Jef?

520
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:18,042
Nothing.

521
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,000
Nothing.

522
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:34,500
Don't worry.
I'll work it all out.

523
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:35,250
What do you want?

524
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,083
You got the four million?

525
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:41,458
Yes.

526
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,500
You accept the new contract?

527
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:46,375
Yes.

528
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:48,792
You shouldn't have come.

529
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,958
I'm leaving.

530
01:41:44,208 --> 01:41:46,042
Don't stay here.

01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:05,625
Why, Jef?

532
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:07,625
I was paid to.

533
01:43:01,792 --> 01:43:03,583
You had a close call.

534
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:06,250
If it weren't for us,
you'd be dead.

535
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,250
Wrong.

1
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Mother, stop!

2
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,083
You've been talking for three days.

3
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,583
I've thought it over.

4
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,333
Alright, I'll get married.

5
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,917
Good! To what sort of man?

6
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,875
What sort of man? Is it up to me?

7
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:18,375
You always speak of money.
Why not marry a rich man?

8
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,792
Marry a rich man and you'll
only be his concubine.

9
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,542
Let me be a concubine.

10
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:35,333
Isn't that a woman's fate?

11
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,542
Miss, looking for someone?

12
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,417
I'm Songlian.

13
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,042
We met once, remember?

14
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,667
It's our Fourth Mistress! Please wait...

15
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,833
We sent the bridal sedan for you.
Didn't it arrive?

16
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,958
I walked here myself.

17
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,000
- Let me carry it.
- I can manage.

18
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,208
Wait here. I'll go take a look.

19
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,292
Who are you?

20
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,333
Fourth Mistress, please come in.

21
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,000
So the Fourth Mistress is you!

22
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,958
Yes, I'm the Fourth Mistress!

23
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,583
Bring my suitcase inside.

24
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,542
This is where you will live.

25
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,583
My name is Chen Baishun, the housekeeper.
I am at your service.

26
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,125
Why are there so many red lanterns?

27
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,708
Because you're coming!

28
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,417
Fourth Mistress,
this is part of our family custom.

29
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,417
I'm here to serve you.

30
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,417
You'll get used to it.

31
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,750
Fourth Mistress. we're here to do your
hair and help you change.

32
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,500
Master, congratulations on your wedding.

33
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,958
How was the foot massage?

34
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,708
A woman's feet are very important.

35
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,458
When they're comfortable,
she is healthier...

36
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,542
...and better able to serve her man.

37
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,083
Pick up that lantern.

38
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,208
Yes, that one.

39
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,875
Higher...

40
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,500
Look up.

41
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,792
Educated girls are different.

42
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,042
Now, undress and get in bed.

43
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,292
Put out the lights.

44
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,958
What? I have all these lanterns
so I can see.

45
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,750
I like it bright and formal.

46
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:02,958
Who's there?

47
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,417
Third Mistress is sick.
She wants you to come.

48
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,042
I'm in bed.

49
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,083
It's an emergency.

50
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,542
She said you must come.

51
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,208
It can wait till tomorrow.

52
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,708
If something serious happens to her,

53
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:19,208
we'll be blamed.

54
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,125
Damn it! What is she up to?

55
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,208
I'll have to go see.
Or she won't let me sleep tonight.

56
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,333
The Master is leaving?
Going to the third house?

57
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,292
Yes!

58
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,667
Light the lanterns at the third house!

59
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,375
Fourth Mistress...

60
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:26,875
Fourth Mistress...

61
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,417
Fourth Mistress. According to our custom,

62
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,917
you should visit the other three mistress.

63
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,625
Take your breakfast later.

64
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:02,083
It's our custom to have all
meetings and meals here.

65
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,042
The Chen family's customs
go back many generations.

66
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:11,000
It is important that you obey them.

67
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,042
Kowtow to our ancestors.

68
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:50,958
First, go to greet the master at
the Third Mistress' house.

69
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,042
It seems they're still asleep.

70
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,000
We'll come back.

71
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:27,542
First Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress is here to visit.

72
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,333
Big sister.

73
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,750
How old are you?

74
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:38,792
Nineteen.

75
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,208
I heard you went to university.

76
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,667
For six months.

77
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,375
It's good you're educated.

78
00:18:56,917 --> 00:19:00,708
You'll get used to living here.

79
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,000
Get on well with your sisters.

80
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,542
Serve the Master well.

81
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,667
You can go now.

82
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,583
Such sins, such sins...

83
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,250
What is she, about 100 years old? Ancient!

84
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,292
Second Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress has come to visit.

85
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:54,000
Fourth sister is here. Come in!

86
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:54,917
Second sister.

87
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,125
Do come in.

88
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,542
What a pretty face! What is your name?

89
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:06,917
Songlian.

90
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,042
A pretty name, too.

91
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,042
I'm Zhouyun. Just call me by my name.

92
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,083
You look like a student.

93
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,000
I was at university for six months.

94
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,875
Why did you leave?

95
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,500
My father died.
The family couldn't afford it.

96
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,500
How old was your father?

97
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,125
Fifty-three.

98
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,458
So young!

99
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,667
Life is so unpredictable.

100
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,083
Tea, Fourth Mistress.

101
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,542
Fourth sister, please have some tea.

102
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,625
Where are you from?

103
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,042
Fengcheng.

104
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,000
They grow tea there.

105
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:01,000
My father was in the tea business.

106
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,208
His shop closed down.

107
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,250
Your mother let you marry someone
from so far away?

108
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:13,917
She's my stepmother.

109
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,208
I see.

110
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:25,375
So, how was the foot massage last night?

111
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,042
Is it like that every night?

112
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,208
Silly.

113
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,375
You can't have it whenever you wish.

114
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,458
Where the master spends the night...

115
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,708
...that mistress gets a foot massage
and lighted lanterns.

116
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,375
With a new wife as young
and pretty as you...

117
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:49,000
...I'm afraid I won't be enjoying
these privileges for some time.

118
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,333
But don't underestimate the
importance of this custom.

119
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,375
If you can manage to have a
foot massage everyday...

120
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:01,917
...you'll soon be running this household.

121
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,375
Yizhen, come meet your Fourth Aunt.

122
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,000
Fourth Aunt!

123
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,542
How useless! I only have a daughter.

124
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,042
It's getting late.

125
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,292
We must visit the Third Mistress.

126
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,792
Sorry, I just keep talking.

127
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,125
Of course you must meet
the Third Mistress.

128
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,542
She was a famous opera singer.

129
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,208
She sings well and is pretty too.

130
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,417
But she can be so difficult.

131
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,917
Asking for the Master on...

132
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,583
...your wedding night!

133
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,667
So impolite to you!

134
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,625
Wasn't she sick?

135
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:47,042
Sick? She's just spoiled!

136
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,167
Has the Master left?

137
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:20,250
Just now.
They're putting out the lanterns.

138
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,458
Let's meet the Third Mistress.

139
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,542
Third Mistress says
she isn't feeling well...

140
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,333
...and says she'll meet you another day.

141
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,583
Third Mistress' son, Feilan.

142
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,250
Same age as Miss Yizhen.

143
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,917
Come meet your Fourth Aunt.

144
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,208
Fourth Aunt!

145
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:54,625
Fourth Mistress...

146
00:23:59,083 --> 00:23:59,875
Fourth Mistress...

147
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,292
...this is Yan'er.

148
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:07,750
Master says she'll be your maid.

149
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,542
Yan'er, come greet the Fourth Mistress.

150
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,917
Fourth Mistress.

151
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,500
I've seen her before.
Bad tempered, isn't she?

152
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,875
No, she's a good girl.
Quick and hardworking too.

153
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,125
Been here for several years.

154
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,417
No lice in her hair, are there?
I hate lice.

155
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,958
Let the Fourth mistress take a look.

156
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,083
Kneel down. Let's look at your hair.

157
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,917
What is that smell? Go wash your hair!

158
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,083
Didn't you hear?

159
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,875
I only washed it yesterday.

160
00:24:57,417 --> 00:25:00,250
And wash the clothes I just took
off while you're at it.

161
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,083
Go, quickly!

162
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,042
Or the Fourth Mistress will be angry. Go!

163
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
Yan'er!

164
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,042
Yan'er!

165
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,458
Why haven't you washed your hair?

166
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:26,833
The Master favours you and you
thought he'd choose you as a wife.

167
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:31,667
You as our Fourth Mistress?

168
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,750
You were born to be a servant.

169
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,208
Serve the Fourth Mistress well!

170
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,542
Don't waste your time dreaming!

171
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,000
And don't forget to wash your hair!

172
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,833
Where is Meishan?

173
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,458
The Third Mistress is coming.

174
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,500
Doctor Gao is writing her a prescription.

175
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,167
Here comes third sister.

176
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,667
Third sister, this is our fourth sister.

177
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,167
You haven't met, have you?

178
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,125
Third sister!

179
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:41,125
Songlian is new here.
Take good care of her.

180
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,292
From now on, you sisters must
get on well with each other.

181
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,833
Let's eat.

182
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,542
Why aren't you eating?

183
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,750
I don't like meat.

184
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,875
What vegetable dishes do we have today?

185
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,500
Master, today we have...

186
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,042
...fragrant mushrooms, chrysanthemum
moss hair, bird's nest...

187
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,708
...thrice-fried mushroom,
five-color vegetables...

188
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:22,667
...vegetarian hot-pot and
also heart of cactus.

189
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:28,708
According to custom...

190
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,542
...the one with lighted lanterns
can have whatever she likes.

191
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:32,833
What would you like?

192
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:37,375
I want spinach and beancurd.

193
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,958
Bring some spinach and beancurd.

194
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:45,083
Also some young bean sprouts.

195
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,208
Fourth Mistress...

196
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:59,542
Master asks you to wait at
the door for instructions.

197
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:03,042
What instructions?

198
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,583
Please wait outside.

199
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,250
The Master may have instructions
before he retires.

200
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:13,458
But why do we have to wait outside?

201
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,125
It's another old family custom.

202
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:17,667
All the other mistresses ago.

203
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,375
But I wasn't called before.

204
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,917
Not for nine days after the wedding.

205
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,875
This is your 10th day.

206
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,542
Light the lanterns at the fourth house!

207
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,042
Well?

208
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:42,042
Lighted lanterns, foot massages.
Do you like it here?

209
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,750
After a few days, you won't want to leave.

210
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,792
Who is it?

211
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,792
Third Mistress says she's sick again.

212
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,708
She wants the master to come over.

213
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,208
Third sister is asking for you again.
You must go.

214
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,667
Meishan is so impossible!

215
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:11,875
Go, don't come to me again.

216
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,417
You don't mean that.

217
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,833
Tell the Third Mistress
I won't see her tonight!

218
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,583
What am I to tell her?

219
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,625
Nonsense! What do you mean?

220
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:27,875
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow!

221
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:43,458
- Who's singing? Third sister?
- Yes.

222
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,208
She was sick last night...

223
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:53,125
...but she's singing at this hour.

224
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,875
She won't let us sleep.

225
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:01,875
She sings when she's happy,
cries when she's mad.

226
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:05,708
That bitch! Never mind her!

227
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:59,542
Third sister, have you recovered?

228
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,042
Did I wake you from your sweet dreams?

229
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,208
Yes, you did.

230
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:13,667
Good, or you'll sleep till you're silly.

231
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:19,708
Silly, hardly!
I came up to hear third sister sing.

232
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,042
Do continue.

233
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,333
You want to listen...

234
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:26,708
...but I don't feel like singing anymore.

235
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,542
You went to hear Meishan sing?

236
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,708
I've spoiled her.

237
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:18,042
When she's angry,
she even curses my ancestors.

238
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,875
Bitch!

239
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:22,208
I must teach her a lesson.

240
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:34,542
What? Angry?

241
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:42,167
Don't be childish.

242
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:46,417
I'll take you to Wumei Lane
today to eat dumplings.

243
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,375
Didn't you say you liked
the dumplings there?

244
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,917
You really don't want me to stay?

245
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:04,375
There are others desperate for
a foot massage, you know.

246
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:13,708
The Master has left!
Blow out the lanterns!

247
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:38,042
Light the lanterns at the third house!

248
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,292
Yan'er!

249
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,958
Yan'er! Yan'er!

250
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,542
Coming!

251
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,083
Can't you walk faster?

252
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,292
Go away if you don't like working for me.

253
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:56,333
Don't think because the mater touched you,
you can behave this way.

254
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,667
Always pulling a long face!

255
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,708
No, I wouldn't dare.

256
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,292
But any face is better than having none!

257
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,583
Why did you come to me?

258
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,792
Tired of your new wife already?

259
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,708
What's so good about my place?

260
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:30,083
She's mad at me.

261
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:31,917
Of course it's good here.

262
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,708
You are gentle and you'll sing for me.

263
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:49,750
Well done!

264
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,417
Well done!

265
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,167
The more you sing,
the better it gets. Again!

266
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:15,833
Fourth sister!

267
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,667
Fourth sister, come down here!

268
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:24,208
I've something to say to you.

269
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,458
Fourth sister.

270
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:31,917
Why wandering alone?

271
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,042
Come down.

272
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:35,708
I'm looking for you.

273
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,042
Second sister.

274
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,500
You don't look well.

275
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,042
No more lighted lanterns
and foot massages...

276
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,667
...are you unhappy?

277
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:54,083
I don't care. I like being alone.

278
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,292
You don't want to be alone in this family.

279
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,542
No foot massages for a few days...

280
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,958
...and the servants don't
treat you the same way.

281
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,958
The master can come and go as he pleases.

282
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,583
Doesn't he find these custom troublesome?

283
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,083
Lighting lanterns is an old family custom.

284
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,292
It was like this when I arrived.

285
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:24,625
This is silk from Suzhou.
Have some dresses made with it.

286
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,208
I'm embarrassed.

287
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,708
I should be giving you gifts.

288
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,375
Why?

289
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,583
I thought of this silk
when I first saw you.

290
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:42,042
I wouldn't give it to that singer...

291
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,875
...even if she paid for it.

292
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:50,125
Did you see how self-satisfied
she was just now?

293
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:55,458
What is that small room for up above?

294
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,125
it's locked with a big chain.

295
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,208
That house of death?

296
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:03,167
Don't go there.
Several people have died there.

297
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:07,542
What people?

298
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,417
Women from past generations.
They hanged there.

299
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:20,083
Don't ask about this.
Nobody here wants to talk about it.

300
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:28,458
Visit me when you have time.
Don't go there again.

301
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,542
The Master's out.

302
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,833
He said you shouldn't wait for him.

303
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,542
Let's eat then.

304
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,375
Why is there no spinach and beancurd?

305
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:04,125
There are too many vegetable
dishes already.

306
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,583
Go, bring some pork steamed
in lotus leaves.

307
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,667
Yes.

308
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,542
Why so many meat dishes today?

309
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,500
The third house had lighted
lanterns yesterday.

310
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:33,417
Didn't the master remarry recently?

311
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:36,708
Who knows about these things?

312
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,833
It's up to him.

313
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,625
The house with lighted lanterns
sets the menu.

314
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:43,958
We just follow orders.

315
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:00,667
Who is it?

316
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:02,625
Yan'er.

317
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,583
Why are you sneaking around like that?

318
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,708
Third Mistress asks you
over to play mahjong.

319
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:13,083
Me, play mahjong? What an idea!

320
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,208
I won't go.

321
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:19,583
Fourth sister...

322
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,625
Fourth sister...

323
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:28,292
...we need one more player. Come!

324
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,042
I don't like mahjong.

325
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:40,292
Come on. Don't stay in your house all day.

326
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:49,625
Still angry about the spinach
and beancurd?

327
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,667
I couldn't care less.

328
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:56,708
Good. I knew fourth sister wasn't petty.

329
00:46:57,042 --> 00:47:00,083
Don't like losing your money to me too?

330
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,292
Don't worry. I'll let you win.

331
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,292
Since you put it that way, then I must go.

332
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,292
But no need to let me win.

333
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,417
Who knows how the game will end?

334
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,708
Good!

335
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,083
This is Doctor Gao, a regular visitor.

336
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,958
He is our family doctor.

337
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,625
His friend, Mr. Wang.

338
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,167
This is our Fourth Mistress.

339
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,208
Please sit down.

340
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:36,708
Let's start.

341
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,292
Our Fourth Mistress was a
university student.

342
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,333
I'm only an opera singer.

343
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,500
She plays to win today.

344
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,875
Both of you should be careful.

345
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
Come, it's just a game.

346
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,958
Third sister's house is
decorated like a stage.

347
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:06,208
No one can forget their past.

348
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,208
The Master's back.

349
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,250
Why wasn't it announced?

350
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,917
I just came in.

351
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:17,917
The Master must be tired.

352
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,375
Where is she?

353
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:22,250
Playing mahjong with the Third Mistress.

354
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:23,125
I'll call her.

355
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,167
Never mind.

356
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,875
Why can't she stay in her own house?

357
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:30,917
Light the lanterns at the second house.

358
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,500
The master's back. He couldn't find you...

359
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,625
...and went to the second house.

360
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:12,750
Nevermind. Let's play.

361
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:24,208
Fourth sister has done Zhuoyun a favour.

362
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:26,792
She is so lonely.

363
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,625
Lend her the master for one night.

364
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,417
If you lose money, have her pay you back.

365
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,625
Then you're even.

366
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:44,833
I heard the Fourth Mistress
didn't finish university. Why?

367
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,083
What's the use?

368
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,833
I'm just one of the Master's robes.

369
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:52,458
He can wear it or he can take it off.

370
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:16,417
Master, I want to give you a son.

371
00:50:54,667 --> 00:51:00,792
Meishan was famous for singing this opera.

372
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,375
That was years ago.

373
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,542
This place must be haunted.

374
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,500
Haunted? Nonsense!

375
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,583
That room on the roof.

376
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:27,875
Two people hanged there, that's all.

377
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:29,958
Why?

378
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:35,500
Need you ask?
They were having illicit affairs.

379
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:37,792
Who were they?

380
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:44,250
Nobody you know.
Two women from past generations.

381
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,500
Concubines?

382
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:53,542
Don't talk nonsense!

383
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,167
What is it now?

384
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,750
She's peeping at us.

385
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,000
- Who?
- Yan'er.

386
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:20,667
What's there to look at.
She can't see anything anyway.

387
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:22,500
You're always on her side.

388
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:28,208
I can smell her miles away.

389
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,292
- Who is it?
- Master.

390
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:44,667
What is it?

391
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:50,625
The Fourth Mistress'
spinach and beancurd is ready.

392
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,625
The other mistresses are waiting.

393
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,292
I'm not going. Ask them to bring it here.

394
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,292
That's not right.

395
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:08,042
We should go or they'll talk.

396
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:09,375
Them!

397
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:13,375
What do I care if they talk!

398
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,042
Alright, we'll eat here.

399
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:21,750
Go, tell them to bring the food here.

400
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,000
The Master asks that you go ahead.

401
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,750
He isn't coming.

402
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,958
The food will be taken to
the Fourth Mistress' room.

403
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:45,875
We don't have this custom here.

404
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:50,583
Is this not the Fourth Mistress' idea?

405
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:07,375
Third sister, don't be angry. Let's eat.

406
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:15,750
Big sister, let me make this clear.

407
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,000
If my lanterns are lit,

408
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:21,042
I want my food brought to me too.

409
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:26,125
You want to be as foolish?

410
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,958
How does that make our Big sister feel?

411
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:34,625
What do I matter? I'm just an old woman.

412
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:39,042
One of these days,
this family will perish in your hands.

413
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:51,708
Who is playing the flute?

414
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:54,833
Our young master.
he came back this morning.

415
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,417
Feipu, son of the First Mistress?

416
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:59,208
I heard he's always away.

417
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:01,125
He's very busy.

418
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,208
He's going Yunnan in the morning.

419
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,708
Are you Songlian?

420
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:08,333
You shouldn't call me by my name.

421
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:11,792
How should I address you? Fourth Mistress?

422
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:20,000
Did the music bring you here?

423
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:24,708
Go on, don't let me stop you.

424
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:26,917
Can you play too?

425
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,167
Feipu, come down here.

426
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,750
My mother wants me. I must go.

427
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,208
Yan'er!

428
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,000
Yan'er!

429
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:27,875
Come here.

430
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,917
Did you open my suitcase?

431
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:38,667
Yes, to tidy up your clothes.

432
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:41,167
Did you see a flute inside?

433
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:46,333
Flute? No. Only men play the flute.

434
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:52,042
You stole it.

435
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:57,375
Fourth Mistress.
Why would I want to steal it?

436
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:00,833
You're always sneaking about.
Stop pretending.

437
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,875
Don't blame it on me.

438
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,833
Ask the other mistress.

439
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:09,333
Have I ever stolen anything?

440
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,875
Fourth Mistress,
I really didn't take your flute!

441
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:21,625
I didn't!

442
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:26,208
Fourth Mistress, I didn't!

443
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:30,708
I didn't take it!

444
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:36,833
Don't go in! I didn't take your flute!

445
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:39,000
Then what are you afraid of?

446
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:40,167
I must take a look!

447
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:52,083
How dare you light lanterns here!

448
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,417
You're only a servant!

449
00:59:56,542 --> 00:59:58,375
Don't you know the rules here?

450
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,375
Do you know what could happen to you?

451
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:05,375
I beg you. Don't tell anyone.

452
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:09,500
Alright, then give me back my flute.

453
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:14,125
I really didn't take you flute.

454
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:20,667
Fourth Mistress...

455
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:43,750
"Songlian."

456
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:52,917
You've put a curse on me!

457
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:58,167
You want me to die!

458
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,292
Don't cry.

459
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:53,208
I shouldn't treat you this way.

460
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:58,000
I'll forget what you did.

461
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:10,125
You can't read or write.

462
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:16,208
Tell me, who wrote my name for you?

463
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:21,500
I can't tell you.

464
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:28,792
Don't be afraid. Tell me who wrote it.

465
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:32,167
I'll keep your secret about the lanterns.

466
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,167
Is it the First Mistress?

467
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,875
Then it must be the Third Mistress.

468
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,583
The Second Mistress? Zhuoyun?

469
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,667
Zhuoyun?

470
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,375
Zhuoyun.

471
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:28,417
Who are you mad at now?

472
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,833
Where did you put my flute?

473
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:45,667
I didn't want it to distract you.
I took it away.

474
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,000
Who gave it to you?

475
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,833
It belonged to my father.

476
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,208
Sorry for being suspicious.

477
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:10,167
I thought it was one of the boys
at university.

478
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,833
Where is it? Give it back.

479
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,833
I had it burnt.

480
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,458
Burnt?

481
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:49,042
It's only a flute.

482
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,333
I'll tell them to buy
you several good ones.

483
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,542
I hate nothing more than people
throwing tantrums.

484
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,792
Why not go to Zhuoyun?

485
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:07,583
She always has a smile on.

486
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:09,875
I'm going!

487
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:17,125
Light the lanterns at the second house!

488
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,417
Fourth sister!

489
01:05:37,042 --> 01:05:41,208
Yan'er said you weren't well.

490
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:53,750
Are you really sick, or just angry?

491
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:56,792
What brought you here?

492
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,625
Get up and give me a haircut.

493
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:03,083
Haircut? I don't know how.

494
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,708
Ask the other sisters.

495
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:07,750
How can they?

496
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:10,000
You're better. You went to university.

497
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:11,875
I want you to cut my hair.

498
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:19,333
Get up! Come!

499
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,042
Why do you suddenly want a haircut?

500
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:36,917
Didn't the Master spend the night
with me last night?

501
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,125
I told him I was getting old.

502
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,417
Guess what he said?

503
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,208
He said I'd look younger with short hair.

504
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
Since he said that,

505
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,042
I must cut my hair.

506
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:58,750
Go ahead, cut!

507
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:01,500
I've never done this before.
You may get hurt.

508
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,625
Don't worry. Go ahead.

509
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:07,042
Alright...

510
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:42,042
My ear!

511
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,042
My ear!

512
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:50,000
My ear!

513
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,833
What happened, Second Mistress?

514
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:57,625
My ear!

515
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:01,667
My ear!

516
01:08:19,792 --> 01:08:21,000
Go away!

517
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:24,167
What are you looking at? Fetch a doctor!

518
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,667
Third sister, what's so funny?

519
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:47,583
If I hated someone,
I'd cut her ear off too.

520
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:50,208
I'd cut all of it off.

521
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:54,417
You think I did it deliberately?

522
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,250
Who knows?

523
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:24,250
Zhuoyun has a Buddha's face
and a scorpion's heart.

524
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,708
She's the true wicked one.

525
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:30,833
You think I'm against you.

526
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:33,458
She's the one I hate most.

527
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,750
I'm no match for her.

528
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:43,250
Perhaps you can do better.

529
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:47,292
I thought so when I first saw you.

530
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,917
Do you know about our giving birth?

531
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:58,083
We both became pregnant
about the same time.

532
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,167
When I was three months along...

533
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:10,583
...she slipped some medicine into my food.

534
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:18,583
I was lucky and didn't have a miscarriage.

535
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,875
When we were due,

536
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,583
she wanted to have her baby first...

537
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:34,833
...and ordered expensive injections
to speed up the delivery.

538
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,250
She was in great pain.

539
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,833
In the end, I was lucky...

540
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:49,125
...and had my boy, Feilan.

541
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:56,083
She only had a cheap little girl...

542
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,000
...born three hours after my son.

543
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:09,208
You're new here and the Master
isn't tired of you yet.

544
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:13,708
But if you don't give him a son...

545
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:17,542
...there will be hard times ahead.

546
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:24,917
You may be a student and
I'm only an opera singer.

547
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:29,417
But our fate is the same.

548
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,750
What happened?

549
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:49,875
The Master spent only one night with me...

550
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:52,875
...and fourth sister already
hates me so much.

551
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,625
She almost killed me.

552
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:08,458
Doctor Gao said the scissors
just missed my artery.

553
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:11,042
That serious?

554
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:20,542
It's your fault.
You said I'd look younger with a haircut.

555
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,958
That gave her the idea.

556
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,417
You sisters shouldn't be like this.

557
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:37,625
Alright.
I'll stay with you for a few nights.

558
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:43,208
Light the lanterns at the second house!

559
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,792
The Fourth Mistress is here.

560
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,292
Fourth sister, you've come.

561
01:12:59,083 --> 01:12:59,875
Second sister!

562
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,000
Do sit down.

563
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:03,875
How are you doing?

564
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:07,292
Doctor Gao said it wasn't serious.

565
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:12,042
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it to happen.

566
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:16,417
Who said you did?

567
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,500
We sisters are friends.

568
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,750
Don't think about it.

569
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,958
It's funny. I should thank you.

570
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:29,417
If not for you...

571
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:32,292
...the Master wouldn't have
stayed with me.

572
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:36,083
Softer, Aunt Cao.

573
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:40,750
If you're alright, I'll be going.

574
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,042
I won't see you to the door.

575
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,167
Yan'er!

576
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,375
Yan'er!

577
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:27,917
What is it, Fourth Mistress?

578
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,167
Where were you?

579
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:35,500
Come massage my feet.

580
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:40,167
I don't know how.

581
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,708
You do as I say.

582
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,125
Softer.

583
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:19,833
I said softer.

584
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:22,750
I said I didn't know how.

585
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:27,417
If you're able, get Aunt Cao to come.

586
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,292
Leave it!

587
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:51,875
"If I'm able"...
You just wait and see what I can do!

588
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:09,625
She's really pregnant?

589
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:10,833
Yes,

590
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:14,375
Fourth Mistress hasn't been
looking well lately.

591
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:18,750
Congratulations, Master.
You'll have another son.

592
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,708
According to custom, from today...

593
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,125
...the lanterns in this house...

594
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:27,375
...will be lit day and night.

595
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:33,083
Yes, day and night.
As a symbol of longevity.

596
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:34,458
Go light the lanterns!

597
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:37,625
Fourth Mistress,
drink this lotus seed soup.

598
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,167
Aunt Cao,

599
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:53,458
someone said I couldn't
get you to serve me.

600
01:17:54,167 --> 01:17:58,458
Who said this about our Fourth Mistress?

601
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:01,375
You're very precious to us now.

602
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:06,500
Call me anytime and I'll come.

603
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:30,542
First Mistress, I'm bringing the
Fourth Mistress her food.

604
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Big sister,

605
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:52,208
did you do this when you were
pregnant with master Feipu?

606
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:56,875
Why don't you eat?

607
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:02,542
Third sister is truly a singer.

608
01:19:03,292 --> 01:19:05,167
Even her laughter sounds like music.

609
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:08,792
But that's nothing.

610
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:12,458
If fourth sister has a son...

611
01:19:13,417 --> 01:19:16,708
...someone will be very unhappy.

612
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:25,417
All of this food can't shut
both of you up!

613
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:31,708
Master asks the Second Mistress...

614
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:34,208
...to go to the fourth house after lunch.

615
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,250
Why?

616
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:39,667
The Fourth Mistress isn't feeling well.

617
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:43,500
Master wants you to give
her a back massage.

618
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:46,625
She knows I can massage?

619
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:55,125
Of course the master told her.

620
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:00,958
It's the Master's idea?

621
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:03,042
It's his order.

622
01:20:03,417 --> 01:20:05,792
Second sister, you must go.

623
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:12,375
Show us how you take good
care of the Master.

624
01:20:13,458 --> 01:20:15,167
If fourth sister feels better,

625
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:17,042
won't the Master be pleased?

626
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:40,333
Feeling better?

627
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:43,333
Much better.

628
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,167
Softer, second sister.

629
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:53,958
Right, just like this.

630
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:31,042
It can't be! Are you sure it's blood?

631
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,917
It looks like it.

632
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:47,750
Yan'er!

633
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:53,917
Yes, Fourth Mistress.

634
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:01,250
What are you up to?

635
01:22:05,542 --> 01:22:07,667
Have you seen my white pants?

636
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:09,083
I washed them.

637
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,417
Washed them?

638
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,292
"How happily they dance
and sing in the sky!"

639
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:24,458
"Lush are the mountain flowers
and the trees high and low!"

640
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:28,625
"Locked in a golden cage I pine away."

641
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:36,833
"Let me return to the forest to
sing my carefree songs!"

642
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:39,583
Good, the next poem.

643
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:43,708
"The moon goes down,
crows cry under the frosty sky."

644
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:51,042
"Dimly lit fishing boats beneath
maples sadly lie."

645
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:54,625
"Beyond the Gusu walls
the Temple of Cold Hill."

646
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:58,083
"Ringing bells reach my boat,
breaking the midnight still."

647
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,542
Well done!

648
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:03,667
Master, the Second Mistress
wishes to see you.

649
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:05,333
Master.

650
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:11,875
Fourth sister seems very tired lately.

651
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,583
When I was pregnant...

652
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:16,833
...I nearly had a miscarriage
and didn't even know it.

653
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:20,875
You should ask Doctor Gao to come.

654
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:24,250
Thank you for reminding me.

655
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:31,375
Tomorrow, ask Doctor Gao
to visit the Fourth Mistress.

656
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:32,375
Yes, Master.

657
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,250
Doctor Gao has finished?

658
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:38,208
Finished.

659
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:39,208
Thank you, doctor.

660
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:42,625
Where is the Master? I must speak to him.

661
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:43,875
Please follow me.

662
01:23:47,167 --> 01:23:48,042
Doctor Gao...

663
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
...you're here.

664
01:23:51,542 --> 01:23:52,875
Third Mistress,

665
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:57,000
are you better after taking my medicine?

666
01:23:57,333 --> 01:24:02,917
Much better. Only I can't sleep at night.

667
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,542
When I've time,
I'll change the prescription.

668
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:09,708
Fine.

669
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:13,500
How is fourth sister?

670
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:17,167
I can't explain now. I'll tell you later.

671
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,708
Doctor Gao!

672
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:25,375
Second Mistress!

673
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:28,792
How is fourth sister? Not serious, is it?

674
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:31,042
I've got to see the master first.

675
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,333
Sorry for troubling you, doctor.

676
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:41,667
Not at all.

677
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,917
Please have some tea.

678
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:54,000
How is fourth sister?

679
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:02,708
I don't know if I should be frank.

680
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,583
Go, leave us alone.

681
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:26,167
Is anything wrong with Songlian?

682
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:34,542
Master,
the Fourth Mistress isn't pregnant.

683
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:38,042
What? Is it true?

684
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,208
I checked carefully.

685
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,500
She isn't pregnant.

686
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:49,958
You're trying to cheat me?

687
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:58,250
Tell me, why did you lie?

688
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:03,208
Don't you know we've rules in this family?

689
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:06,708
Rules we've been following...

690
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:10,833
...for many generations!

691
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,417
How dare you!

692
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,042
- Cover the lanterns!
- What did you say, Master?

693
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,333
Cover the lanterns!

694
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,458
Cover the lanterns!

695
01:27:45,917 --> 01:27:46,750
Yan'er...

696
01:27:49,542 --> 01:27:52,708
Why did Doctor Gao come all of a sudden?

697
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:56,500
Where are my white pants?

698
01:27:58,292 --> 01:27:59,458
I'll fetch them.

699
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:37,708
A servant secretly
lighting lanterns in her room!

700
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:40,250
Who let you put lanterns here?

701
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,708
Who do you think you are?

702
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:45,417
Have you no respect for the mistresses?

703
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,917
Does this family have rules or not?

704
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:50,833
Stop making a scene!

705
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:53,333
Don't act like one of the servants.

706
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:56,375
No, this is one of your rules.

707
01:28:57,542 --> 01:29:01,208
Rules are rules,

708
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:04,000
but everyone can make mistakes.

709
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:12,542
Let me remind you that they've
just covered your lanterns.

710
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,500
But I am still a mistress.

711
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:20,625
Mistresses are mistresses!
Maids are maids!

712
01:29:23,042 --> 01:29:25,667
Big sister, the Master is away...

713
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:29,375
...In front of everyone here...

714
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,125
...you be the judge.

715
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,167
I broke a rule and they
covered my lanterns.

716
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:39,292
What happens if a servant breaks the rule?

717
01:29:45,542 --> 01:29:46,792
Follow the old custom!

718
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,458
The First Mistress said...

719
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:26,833
...you could get up if you apologized.

720
01:30:27,542 --> 01:30:28,875
Why do this?

721
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,167
Have her drink this hot ginger tea.

722
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:07,625
It'll make her sweat.

723
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:09,125
Has the doctor come?

724
01:31:09,292 --> 01:31:14,042
He came several times
but she isn't improving.

725
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,333
The Master's back.

726
01:31:16,458 --> 01:31:19,167
Said to send her to the hospital.

727
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:21,708
Who could tell the Fourth Mistress
would be so vicious?

728
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,875
Yan'er shouldn't have made her angry.

729
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:35,458
- Housekeeper.
- Yes, Master.

730
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:38,292
Get her good medicine.
Never mind the money.

731
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:41,542
Or people will say we let our servant die.

732
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,208
Yes, Master.

733
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:31,375
Light the lanterns at the second house!

734
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:19,458
Fourth sister,
what are you doing here so early?

735
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:23,375
I've come to listen to third sister sing.

736
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:26,708
You sing so well.

737
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:33,750
Good or bad, it's all playacting.

738
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:36,750
If you play well, you fool the others.

739
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:39,583
If you play badly,
you can only fool yourself.

740
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:42,667
If you can't even fool yourself,

741
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,542
you can fool the ghosts.

742
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:48,500
People breathe, ghosts cannot.
That's the only difference.

743
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:53,083
People are ghosts, and ghosts are people.

744
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:58,250
Don't mind me for saying this...

745
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:01,458
...but you shouldn't have made
such a fuss about Yan'er.

746
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:07,292
She's only dreaming of
becoming a mistress.

747
01:35:07,708 --> 01:35:11,750
She's only scapegoat.
I was after someone else.

748
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:17,542
Yes, she's only a maid.

749
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:19,417
Someone is behind her.

750
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,167
Look how pleased Zhuoyun was last night.

751
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:29,375
She thinks she's so smart.
I'll take care of her soon!

752
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:35,000
Light the lanterns, blow out the lanterns,
cover the lanterns.

753
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:37,542
What do I care?

754
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:43,792
What do people amount to in this house?

755
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:48,792
They're like dogs, cats or rats.

756
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,792
But certainly not people.

757
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:57,833
Isn't it better to hang
yourself in that room?

758
01:35:58,042 --> 01:36:01,708
Don't talk about dying.

759
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:05,708
Why think about what people are like?
Just go on living.

760
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,333
Don't be so unhappy.

761
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:20,958
Look at me. I always keep myself amused.

762
01:36:21,625 --> 01:36:24,042
Of course you're happy.

763
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:27,625
You've got Doctor Gao.

764
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:32,750
What do you mean by that?

765
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:35,875
Nothing.

766
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:39,125
I should thank him for coming to see me.

767
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:44,708
Don't joke about this.

768
01:36:45,958 --> 01:36:48,250
If you tell anyone,

769
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,083
you'll have me to deal with.

770
01:36:53,667 --> 01:36:56,958
To be honest, I'm meeting him soon.

771
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,958
What can they do to me?

772
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:16,292
Fourth Mistress...

773
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,833
You frightened me.

774
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:26,875
I thought nobody was here.

775
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:38,833
Master said I'd be your maid from now on.

776
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:45,625
I may be old, but I'm experienced.

777
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:48,792
Not like those young girls.

778
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:50,667
Get me some wine.

779
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:54,542
What? I didn't hear you.

780
01:37:55,333 --> 01:38:00,042
Bring me some wine. Today's my birthday.

781
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:02,292
Your birthday?

782
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,125
How old are you?

783
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,125
Twenty.

784
01:38:06,292 --> 01:38:10,083
Why didn't you say so earlier?

785
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,500
I'll get the wine.

786
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:19,208
The wine is here.

787
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:33,333
Why are you looking at me that way?

788
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,167
Yan'er is dead.

789
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,833
She died in the hospital.

790
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:49,333
When?

791
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:50,875
I don't know.

792
01:38:52,375 --> 01:38:56,958
They said she died calling your name.

793
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:04,125
Why? Did she think I killed her?

794
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:08,833
I'm only repeating what they said.

795
01:39:09,292 --> 01:39:12,833
She can't blame you. It's her destiny.

796
01:39:15,667 --> 01:39:16,833
Where is she now?

797
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:22,500
Her family took the body
back to the village.

798
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:28,167
They were all crying. It was very sad.

799
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:46,333
Why cry?

800
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:50,917
It's better dead than alive and suffering.

801
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:53,500
She's lucky to have died.

802
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:58,500
Fourth Mistress, stop drinking!
You're drunk!

803
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:02,958
I'm happy today. It's my birthday.

804
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:07,167
My twentieth birthday.

805
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,500
Young master, you're back?

806
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:13,792
Please talk to the Fourth Mistress.

807
01:40:14,042 --> 01:40:15,875
She's drunk!

808
01:40:18,417 --> 01:40:21,042
You're back, young master.

809
01:40:21,375 --> 01:40:23,000
Why are you drinking?

810
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:25,458
Sit down.

811
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:31,583
I'm celebrating my birthday.

812
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:37,375
Have a drink. Congratulate me.

813
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:49,208
Alright, I'll have some.

814
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,375
May you live to be 99.

815
01:40:54,208 --> 01:40:59,042
Nonsense! I don't want to live that long.

816
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:03,167
Save such wishes for your father.

817
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:09,667
I heard what happened.

818
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:13,042
You're so foolish.

819
01:41:14,292 --> 01:41:18,000
How long could you lie
about being pregnant?

820
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:22,208
Foolish? I'm not foolish.

821
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,667
I had it planned. At first it was a lie.

822
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:32,208
But if the Master stayed with me,

823
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,667
soon it would be true.

824
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:41,917
I was planning this,
but they were plotting against me.

825
01:41:43,375 --> 01:41:47,875
Everyone is plotting against each other.

826
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:51,958
What is the meaning of all this?

827
01:41:56,792 --> 01:41:58,417
This is from Yunnan.

828
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,583
Take it as your birthday gift.

829
01:42:07,542 --> 01:42:10,917
Only women give this to men.

830
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:14,667
Not the other way around.

831
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,833
Don't want it? Never mind.
Someone gave it to me.

832
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:28,833
Hypocrite! Which woman gave it to you?

833
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:36,125
If I take it, won't my hands be soiled?

834
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:40,958
I was just fooling. Wasn't really
going to let you have it.

835
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:47,125
Fooling? I'm used to being fooled.

836
01:42:49,625 --> 01:42:51,042
Everyone is fooling me.

837
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:55,167
And now you?

838
01:43:00,042 --> 01:43:05,583
Get out! Get out of here!

839
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:10,208
Feipu!

840
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,167
I'm going.

841
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:54,792
Master! Master!

842
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:55,875
Fourth Mistress, please stop!

843
01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:58,167
Why is she drinking?

844
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:00,792
She wants to drink.

845
01:44:01,042 --> 01:44:03,208
Ask the first Mistress for
medicine to sober her up!

846
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:08,875
Don't go to that old witch!

847
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:11,583
See how crazy you look!

848
01:44:12,542 --> 01:44:13,500
People will laugh!

849
01:44:14,333 --> 01:44:18,833
What is there to laugh at?

850
01:44:19,542 --> 01:44:21,208
The Master likes you.

851
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:24,250
Meishan has gone to meet
her good-looking doctor.

852
01:44:24,417 --> 01:44:28,500
What do I have? I've nothing! Nothing!

853
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:30,500
Where is Meishan?

854
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:35,958
She's meeting the good-looking doctor.

855
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:40,333
What do I have? Nothing!

856
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,125
When did the Third Mistress go out?

857
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:45,000
I don't know.

858
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:49,917
What am I afraid of? Nothing!

859
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:57,625
Big sister!

860
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:01,667
The medicine is here. Make her drink it.

861
01:45:01,917 --> 01:45:03,708
I won't! I'm not drunk!

862
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:05,833
Don't just stand there!

863
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:07,083
Hold that crazy woman!

864
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:10,542
Hold her down! Quick!

865
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:20,292
Get out!

866
01:45:23,125 --> 01:45:27,500
Let her scream!
Let her make a fool of herself!

867
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:30,333
The Master's away and she's
turned the house upside down!

868
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:15,250
Fourth sister, are you sober now?

869
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:20,708
I'm glad you told me yesterday.

870
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:23,667
Or there would be such a scandal!

871
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:28,125
It's cold here. Go back to your room.

872
01:47:36,792 --> 01:47:39,333
What happened?

873
01:47:39,542 --> 01:47:46,958
The Third Mistress and Doctor Gao
were in a hotel in town.

874
01:47:47,792 --> 01:47:50,333
When the Second Mistress
had the door opened...

875
01:47:50,583 --> 01:47:52,708
...they were still in bed.

876
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,667
Such sin!

877
01:47:55,583 --> 01:47:59,542
Did the Second Mistress say I told her?

878
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:07,708
You told her when you
were drunk yesterday.

879
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:11,583
I was so shocked.

880
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:18,500
I said it?

881
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,250
You did.

882
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:24,208
I wondered why you told her.

883
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:26,833
Is it that you hate the doctor?

884
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:31,833
You drank a lot yesterday.
You can't remember.

885
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:39,083
What will happen to the Third sister?

886
01:48:39,292 --> 01:48:41,708
They've gone to fetch the Master.

887
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:48,833
What must happen...will happen.

888
01:48:49,667 --> 01:48:53,833
Go and rest. Or you'll catch cold.

889
01:48:54,667 --> 01:48:59,625
Such heavy snow! Must be a bad year!

890
01:53:45,042 --> 01:53:46,375
Murderers!

891
01:53:47,625 --> 01:53:54,667
Murderers!

892
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:03,917
Murderers!

893
01:54:25,167 --> 01:54:26,375
The Master is here.

894
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,667
- Master
- Master

895
01:54:30,042 --> 01:54:30,875
The Master is back.

896
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:47,958
What did you see?

897
01:54:49,042 --> 01:54:50,583
You murderers!

898
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:54,667
Meishan is dead. You murderers!

899
01:54:54,833 --> 01:54:59,292
Nonsense! What did you see?

900
01:55:00,083 --> 01:55:01,583
You didn't see a thing!

901
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:05,333
Murderers! You murderers!

902
01:55:05,542 --> 01:55:10,708
You're mad! You're gone mad!

903
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:18,083
Murderers...You murderers!

904
01:55:29,958 --> 01:55:32,125
Housekeeper!

905
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:35,333
Housekeeper!

906
01:55:36,708 --> 01:55:41,125
Housekeeper! The lanterns are lit!

907
01:55:41,292 --> 01:55:42,333
What happened?

908
01:55:42,542 --> 01:55:47,042
The lanterns in the third house are lit!

909
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:47,958
What...What?

910
01:55:48,042 --> 01:55:48,792
Where?

911
01:55:48,958 --> 01:55:49,833
It's haunted!

912
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:53,667
It's the Third Mistress' ghost!

913
01:56:46,042 --> 01:56:51,208
The Third Mistress is singing!

914
01:57:10,417 --> 01:57:14,458
It's haunted!

915
01:59:38,042 --> 01:59:43,750
The housekeeper congratulates
the Fifth Mistress on her wedding.

916
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:23,667
Who is that?

917
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,625
She was our Fourth Mistress.
She has gone mad.

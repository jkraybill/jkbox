They have driven me
from hearth and home,

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,268

Worried because her father
has been away so long...

70
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:39,280
I had nothing to do with the two murders...
So help me God...

71
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:56,709
The old woman... It's true...
I tried to kill her...

72
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:06,511
by stabbing her in the side
with a similar knife...

73
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:15,514
to throw suspicion
on the mysterious murderer...

74

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:16,399
It couldn't have been Cesare...

78
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:25,110

LUNATIC ASYLUM

84
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,280
Do you have a patient
by the name of Dr. Caligari?

85
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:05,113
The director returned earlier today...
Perhaps you should speak to him personally...

86
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:19,709
He... himself... and none other...
is Caligari...

87

THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.

93
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,955
In the year 1783,
a mystic by the name of Caligari

94
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,951
toured the fairs of numerous villages
in northern Italy,

95
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:35,710
accompanied by a somnambulist
named Cesare.

96
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:47,873
...for months he sowed panic
amongst village folks

97
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:55,998
through a series of foul murders committed
under almost identical circumstances...

98
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:22,675
...he had entirely subjugated to his will
a somnambulist named Cesare,

99
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:30,912
whom he did compel
to carry out his nefarious schemes.

100
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:38,714
A puppet, the exact likeness of Cesare,
and which took his place in a cabinet,

101
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:48,590
allowed him to divert any suspicion
that might fall on the somnambulist.

102
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,915
My diary.

103
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,754
12 March... Finally... finally!

104
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:14,468
A somnambulist has been brought
to the asylum for admission...

105
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,634
Afternoon - My desire... I shall be able
to satisfy my life's unwavering wish...!

106
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:13,114
Now I shall unravel
the psychiatric secrets of this Caligari!

107
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,550
Now I shall discover if it is true

108
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,390
that a somnambulist
can be compelled to perform acts

109
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,559
that in a walking state
he would never commit

110
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,515
and would be repugnant to him...

111
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:39,309
Whether it is true that a sleepwalker
can be led to commit even murder...

112
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,515
An obsession.

113
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:39,517
I must know everything... I must penetrate
his secrets. I must become Caligari...

114
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:09,593
YOU MUST BECOME CALIGARI

115
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,190
END OF ACT V

116
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,230
ACT VI

117
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:46,595
We found the sleepwalker out in the fields...

118
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:13,517
Mr. Director - unmask yourself.
You are Dr. Caligari!

119
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:10,792
...and from that day on,
the madman never again left his cell.

120
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:38,709
Look... there's Cesare... never allow him
to tell your fortune, or you're dead...

121
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:23,475
Jane... I love you...
won't you be my wife at last?

122
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:41,432
We queens are not free to answer
the call of our heart...

123
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,599
You all think that - I'm insane!

124
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:32,159
It isn't true...
It's the director who's insane!!

125
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,589
He is Caligari... Caligari... Caligari!

126
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,438
At last I understand his delusion.
He thinks I am that mystic, Caligari...!

127
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,438
Now I know exactly how to cure him...

128
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,431
THE END

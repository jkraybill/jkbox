00:00:54,763 --> 00:01:01,180
[Hou Haap]
MAGNIFICENT HEROES

2
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:06,271
When we used to cross paths, it was fate

3
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:12,023
With our hearts as one
we wielded our blades, destroying the enemy

4
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:18,239
Blood and arrows filled the sky,
a sight that became commonplace

5
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,955
We crossed thousands of mountains,
swallowed up by the wind and the rain

6
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:28,960
As suddenly as we would meet,
we would also part ways

7
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:35,043
We are both drifters of the lakes and the seas,
but our destinies take different paths

8
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:41,015
To live through a hundred misfortunes
is my own solitary path

9
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:47,396
How much bitterness and difficulty
have I faced?

10
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:54,103
The thousands of praise in this world,

11
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:59,742
Will become envy and disdain tomorrow!

12
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:05,623
With pride and mirth,
roam the world as a wanderer!

13
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,580
But the fame and fortune of such a life
dissolves into sentiment and sorrow

14
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:15,170
So now we meet again, just like old times

15
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:21,547
To think that the light of our blades
is now full of hate

16
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:27,391
I long to cast away this iron sword,
but, alas, lam unable

17
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:33,017
In the chaotic rain and the frigid wind,
I have such resentments!

18
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,325
Tonight's the kind of night
that's worth having that extra drink!

19
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,784
Oh right, have you seen the bride yet?

20
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,538
Not yet.

21
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,921
But I think she's got to be more beautiful
than my wife!

22
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,422
Apparently the bride
hails from a prestigious family.

23
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,506
Hey now, how could she be a match for our
Lord Kao if she was just any old peasant?

24
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,600
Young Master Kao and his dad
are actually complete opposites!

25
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,680
How are they different?

26
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,512
The senior Lord Kao made his name
using his fists.

27
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,393
Young Master Kao's martial arts isn't bad.

28
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:12,939
Right.

29
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,224
But he likes to study.

30
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,486
He says, "Only with a head of knowledge
can you get ahead in life".

31
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,732
Is that how it is?

32
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,157
We don't have any book smarts,
that's why we're not going places.

33
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:22,949
ReaHy?

34
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,150
I don't think so.

35
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,487
A scholarly man
isn't necessarily a good man.

36
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,703
Is that right?

37
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,748
Ah! Maybe all that studying he's doing
is for use in the bedroom.

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,162
Oh, then he must really be something!

39
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:37,960
Congratulations, my lord!

40
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,334
Congratulations! Congratulations!

41
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,635
Congratulations! Congratulations!

42
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,546
Hey!

43
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,174
My honoured seniors.

44
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,183
My good friends.

45
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,390
| drink to you all.

46
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,683
Cheers!

47
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,278
Youngest nephew, a drink.

48
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,610
Back in the day,
your old man and I fought...

49
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,278
108 battles together, right?

50
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,865
Youngest nephew,
you really have a good memory!

51
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:11,872
Cheers!

52
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,540
After you.

53
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,753
- Amazing! Amazing!
- Fantastic! Wonderful! Wonderful! Great!

54
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,512
Truly... in the heart of a youth...
lies that of a hero.

55
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,346
He's just like his old man: full of guts!

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,475
Taking such a beautiful wife.

57
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,152
Even if it brings ruin to your family,
it's still a good deal.

58
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,106
My Lord, your wife's as pretty as a picture!

59
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,568
I'm not ashamed to tell you that
she is the famed rose of the Drunken Red.

60
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,947
Huh? Isn't the Drunken Red...

61
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,036
A brothel?

62
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,738
Idon't believe it.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,084
Of the so-called famed roses I've bedded,
eight out of ten were as ugly as pigs!

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,871
She is the only one
whose talent and beauty stands out.

65
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,502
That's why I bought her freedom
with 1,000 taels.

66
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,084
Doesn't the young mistress hail
from a prestigious family?

67
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,885
I have to keep up appearances.

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,549
You said it right:

69
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,181
"A scholarly man
isn't necessarily a good man."

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,176
Dear husband.

71
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,056
Dear wife.

72
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,909
Pai Chung-Tang?!

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,490
The senior Lord Kao's sworn enemy?!

74
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,287
My lord, be careful.

75
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,549
How could it be
that on the occasion of Lord Kao's wedding,

76
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,097
that even I, Pai Chung-Tang,
have not been invited?

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,595
It was my youthful negligence.

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,384
My apologies.

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,979
The Kao Villa
is so renowned throughout the land.

80
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,482
And we have arrived
completely out of the blue.

81
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,982
It is only proper
that we bring a small token of goodwill.

82
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,294
What a truly thoughtful gift.

83
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,089
Is it too little, or is it too much?

84
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,421
If it's not enough, there's more!

85
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,340
My lord!

86
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,964
I've got his sword!

87
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,175
Protect his lordship!

88
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,072
I have always loved you... trusted you!

89
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,531
But the money Pai Chung-Tang gave me
was even more than you!

90
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,196
With 1,000 taels you could buy her freedom.

91
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,328
But with 2,000 taels,
I could get her to kill you.

92
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,412
A whore by any other name.

93
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,089
Kao Peng!

94
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,848
Three years ago...

95
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,969
Your dad stole
this mountain fortress from me!

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,929
I swore an oath on my life:

97
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,013
I will have revenge!

98
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,230
How presumptuous!

99
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,517
Leave him to me!

100
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,711
Protect his lordship!

101
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,040
Take the young master and get out of here!

102
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,924
My lord, let's go!

103
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,301
You two protect his lordship!

104
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,306
My lord! My lord! We need to go!

105
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,183
Let's go! My lord!

106
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,884
I want revenge!

107
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,303
I want revenge!

108
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,805
- I want revenge!
- My lord!

109
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,765
I want rev-

110
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,578
Big brother, just about
everyone in Kao Villa has been *chch!*

111
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,579
I want Kao Villa...

112
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,498
Devoid of all life!

113
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,847
I want... I want...

114
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,187
I want... I want...

115
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,524
Revenge".

116
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,276
I want revenge!

117
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,821
You have to rest properly for a few days.

118
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,119
If you do not, your wounds will re-open.

119
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,912
You will easily bleed to death.

120
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,866
Grandmaster! |...

121
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,132
Save this breath.

122
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,085
To have revenge...

123
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,427
You must rely on this breath!

124
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,183
I believe that I can kill Pai Chung-Tang.

125
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,893
You are definitely not his opponent.

126
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,320
We can hire and recruit warriors!

127
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,906
A true warrior of unparalleled skill
is not found with money.

128
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,289
Grandmaster...

129
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,670
You've helped me once already,
so you might as well help me again.

130
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,462
Grandmaster.

131
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,175
How can I find
a true warrior of unparalleled skill?

132
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:29,477
If your heart is consumed by vengeance,
your wounds will only worsen.

133
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,564
But... the loss of my family...

134
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,064
...causes me more suffering than any wound.

135
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,950
There is a young man:

136
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,118
Chang San the Divine Blade.

137
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,246
I think he can defeat Pai Chung-Tang.

138
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,173
A bit cruel, don't you think?

139
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,130
Can you see the two bite marks
on the chicken's arse?

140
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,761
Wha-What bite marks?

141
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,221
They must've been left by a Chinese cobra!

142
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,687
The chicken's full of snake venom.

143
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,023
If you eat it,
you'll bleed from all eight orifices!

144
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,020
Bleed from eight orifices?

145
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,476
Isn't itjust seven?

146
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,648
Where's the eighth one?

147
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,191
Where you take a shit!

148
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,655
I bet the King of Hell's gonna have you
reincarnate as a chicken!

149
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,782
If I was smart, I wouldn't eat this chicken.

150
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,407
Right.

151
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,240
You little bastard!
Your mum'll gonna be a chicken!

152
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,075
- How dare you try and eat my chicken!
- Hey! Don't fight! Don't fight!

153
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,499
I'll kill you!

154
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,293
- Hey! Steal my chicken, huh?
- Hey, don't fight here!

155
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,120
Give it back!

156
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,921
Hey! Hey! Come back!

157
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,959
Give me my chicken!

158
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:40,710
Hey! Hey! Over here!

159
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,917
Hey, give it back!

160
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,132
If you don't give it back,
I'll kill you!

161
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,846
Don't pick on kids!

162
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,256
So what if! do?

163
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,764
If you do, there'll be someone
who doesn't like what they see.

164
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,600
Do you know who I-

165
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,477
Idon't care who the hell you are!

166
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,608
In this town I've got money,
and I've got respect!

167
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,438
You've got money?

168
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,296
Let's go buy a bird.

169
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,006
Are we gonna look for a lady?

170
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,057
The kind of bird you can eat!

171
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:35,682
Still wanna fight?

172
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,480
Some... some other time.

173
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,482
I washed eight horses today.

174
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,188
The total is 8 candareens.

175
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,241
Here, 8 candareens.

176
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,957
Waiter, the bill.

177
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,566
Distinguished sir, come in and have a seat.

178
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,188
The ladies we have here are very beautiful!

179
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,519
[HOUSE OF TEN THOUSAND FRAGRANCES]

180
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,415
Please don't stop.

181
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,506
You can come inside.

182
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,015
I don't have enough silver and taels.

183
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,475
There's nobody around right now.

184
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,314
It will be really easy
if you want to come in.

185
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:02,982
No way.

186
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,150
It doesn't cost anything out here.

187
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,775
I only want to hear you play the zither.

188
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,087
Hey.

189
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,302
Thank you.

190
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,635
And another freak.

191
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,598
I'm not the only one.

192
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,521
There's a few more down there.

193
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,685
Three of them.

194
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,975
They've been following me all day.

195
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,316
Being followed...
Could be good, could be bad.

196
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,236
I assume it's probably something bad.

197
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,526
How ominous.

198
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,166
This one time,
these three kids were always following me.

199
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,663
Over mountains and over ridges.

200
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,082
They followed me everywhere,
it pissed me off.

201
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,414
What happened in the end?

202
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,214
In the end, I had a good look at them.

203
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,588
Their three faces looked exactly like mine!

204
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,669
And then they even called me dad.

205
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,348
Turns out they were bastard kids
I left behind somewhere sometime.

206
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,853
Are you alright?

207
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,735
The character for "Fortune"
hangs over my head.

208
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,232
How could anything go wrong?

209
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,111
I sleep when I'm full.

210
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,946
I eat when I've slept.

211
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,370
And when I make some money...

212
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,455
...I go drinking.

213
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,249
You sure know how to live the good life.

214
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,289
Oh, no!

215
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,746
Mother's waiting for her medicine!

216
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,760
If I say I'll come, I'll come.

217
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,491
Aside from killing...

218
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,282
...I know there's nothing else
you care about.

219
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,117
Perhaps.

220
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,169
Be careful.

221
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,297
You can cut your hand like that.

222
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,717
You have to be careful too.

223
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,470
Or you might end up cutting yourself.

224
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,808
When I'm coming, I come by myself.

225
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,602
When going, I go by myself.

226
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,680
When it comes to other people...

227
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,645
...I have no relationships with anybody.

228
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,403
You know...

229
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,948
That I am your only friend.

230
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,324
Fﬁend?

231
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,951
In this line of work...

232
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,078
...you have to even kill friends sometimes.

233
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,252
I know you won't.

234
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,962
If not, how come you've had
such rotten luck all your life?

235
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,050
Do you have any more wine? Huh?

236
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,758
You're a first-rate swordsman,
but a second-rate killer.

237
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,101
If you killed the wrong person...

238
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,221
...you wouldn't be able
to live with yourself.

239
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,431
If you don't kill...

240
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,017
...you'll live a drunk, and die a dreamer.

241
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,945
Are you this long-winded to all the guests?

242
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,070
To other people...

243
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,954
...I don't say a single word from the heart.

244
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,961
Is there any more wine?

245
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,093
No!

246
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,047
There's only me.

247
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,367
Now that's good wine.

248
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,840
But it tastes a bit of incense and ash.

249
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,259
Go sleep hugging the wine pot then!

250
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,225
Go brew the medicine first.

251
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:08,696
Don't worry.

252
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,247
Mother will get better in no time.

253
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,952
What's the matter then?

254
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,216
Promise me that you won't get mad
after I tell you.

255
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,425
Alright, I won't.

256
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,422
Tell me.

257
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,297
It's because of him!

258
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,510
Chuan?

259
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,221
Did he hit you?

260
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:30,926
No.

261
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,765
What did he do then?!

262
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,769
He said he won't marry me!

263
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:40,690
Older brother!

264
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,230
- I don't believe this!
- What are you doing?

265
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,189
- I don't believe this!
- Don't be like this!

266
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,066
You said you wouldn't get mad!

267
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,492
Don't worry!

268
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,244
There's no way you won't get married!

269
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,537
- Older brotherll
- Chuan!

270
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,076
- Older brother!
- Come back here!

271
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,578
Don't be like this!

272
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,702
Older brother!

273
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,503
Chuan, open the door now!

274
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,504
Come out!

275
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,373
Open the door!

276
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,541
I... I'm sick!

277
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,042
Sick?!

278
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,135
If you're sick,
how come your voice is still fine?!

279
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,337
I don't believe it!

280
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,677
Why won't you marry my sister?!

281
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:13,685


282
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,357
So my sister isn't pretty enough?!

283
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,561
She's pretty,
and you can say she's easy on the eyes!

284
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,150
Have you ever loved her?!

285
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,695
When you put it that way,
I guess there is something there--

286
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,578
Why haven't you married her yet then?
Out with it!

287
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,250
I've given it a lot of thought, except... but...

288
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,202
But what?!

289
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,419
But she...
but she's got such a fierce brother.

290
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,671
How could I dare marry her?!

291
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,043
Fine!

292
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:47,802
I'm not fierce!

293
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,597
If there's something, just say it.

294
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,595
I'm
P
00
r
!

295
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,020
I made a vow that if! can't make money,
I won't take a wife!

296
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:57,721
Poor?!

297
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,433
There's love between a man and wife!

298
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,237
Even if all you have to eat is water,
you'll still be full!

299
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,366
If you have enough money,
then you also have respect!

300
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,582
I want my wife
to be able to live comfortably!

301
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,377
This is what it means to be a real man!

302
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,079
Bullshit!
Are you marrying my sister or not?!

303
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,209
Older brother, stop fighting!

304
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,506
Help me. Please help me.

305
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,838
Older brother, please stop beating him!

306
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:31,464
I beg you!

307
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,389
Stay out of this!

308
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:32,965
Get out of the way!

309
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,683
Older brother, stop beating him!

310
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,472
He's about to break!

311
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,148
San!

312
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,393
You're fighting again?!

313
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,148
I'm not!

314
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,896
It's not my fault!

315
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,198
He fell down by himself!

316
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:51,908
Oh, dear!

317
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,406
Just look at yourself!

318
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,370
How'd you get so dirtyjust falling down?

319
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,867
Your eye's all swollen too!

320
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,200
M-My arm!

321
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:00,454
Your arm...?

322
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,209
My arm!

323
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,544
Oh yeah, it's dislocated!

324
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:05,915


325
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,679
Mother, don't get angry.

326
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:16,975
Sit down first.

327
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,600
Ah! Let me check if the medicine is ready.

328
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,977
I've always told you to not get into fights.

329
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,355
Why do you have to be so disobedient?!

330
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:25,859
I know!

331
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,685
I know!

332
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,362
The medicine should be good to drink now.

333
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,030
Drink it.

334
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,815
Get up.

335
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,536
Do you want to be my wife?

336
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,409
Then hurry up and boil some water.

337
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,410
I need to bathe!

338
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,290
Alright.

339
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,368
The water can't be too cold or too hot!

340
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,044
Alright.

341
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,750
Grandmaster.

342
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,717
I know you have the Moon Shadow Sword.

343
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,213
Would you be able to...?

344
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,174
You are not yet worthy!

345
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,300
I carry an indignation
that demands absolute retribution.

346
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,100
How can that make me unworthy?!

347
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,060
The bravery of fools,

348
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,524
brings the downfall of a kingdom.

349
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,902
With an unjust heart,

350
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,488
a sword can only do evil.

351
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,075
Grandmaster.

352
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,536
To wield the Moon Shadow Sword,

353
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,990
I have more than enough reason and worth.

354
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:24,747
Grandmaster.

355
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,998
I beg you to bestow the sword to me!

356
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,799
Until you have cultivated your mind,

357
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,673
trained your heart to be free of all evil.

358
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:37,014
When using a sword
becomes the same as using your heart.

359
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,514
Only then will I consider bestowing the

362

364
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,903
Grandmaster, give the sword to me!

365
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,576
Grandmaster, I can't wait any longer!

366
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,282
I must have my revenge!

367
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,835
I'm begging you.

368
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,886
Why beg others, when you can beg yourself?

369
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,388

386
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,723

00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,697

400
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,104
You'll get it in your next life.

401

00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:00,216
Well?

404
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:00,588
Anything?

405
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,213
Nothing!

406

He said I'd get 100 taels ifI rescued him.

410
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,563

00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,525
"It's better to trust a whore
than to trust a gentleman."

412
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,030
This is some rotten luck.

413

Think about it.

415
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,618
I'm drawing a blank.

416

417
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,675

And?

420
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,476
Did it get bent or something?

421
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,894
You touched my blade.

Where is your blade?

427
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,521
Stored away.

and one can seal away their blade,
and live a life of seclusion.

433

Because under heaven,

434
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,088
there will never again
be another king of the blade.

435
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,336
Chang San the Divine Blade
is not what they say he is.

436
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,807
IfI had a blade in hand...

437
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,553
...you would also have to accept one's fate.

438
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,190
Then we'll have to see
whose life is more valuable.

439

440
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,274
At long last...

441
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,942

and see who is superior.

I have no friends.

00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,688
I want to buy it.

448
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,153

00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,868
You won't be able to afford my price.

452
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,038
What about... 1,000 taels?

453
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,042
1,000 taels...

454
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,084
That'll be enough for me
to buy 1,000 women.

455
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,926
If you're worth 1,000 taels,
then Chang San is worth 10,000 taels.

456
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,754
Comparing your skill with a blade to his:

457
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,472
You're not even close!

458
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,853
When I've defeated Chang San...

459
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,605
Then you'll know how much I'm worth.

461
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,527
There is a way
you can still make 10,000 taels.

462
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,079
I'll consider it.

...I will give it up.

who really cares about you.

494

00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,251
Besides, I've got nothing left to lose anymore.

545
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,229
Here you are.

546
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,031
It's still such a fine blade!

547
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,408
Hey! Hey!

548
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,278
What are you doing?!

549
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,780
Hey! What are you doing?!

550
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,407
Trying out the blade!

551
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,418
Ah, this is bad!

552
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:51,998
Gone!

553
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:52,832
Ah, it's gone!

554
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:53,674
Afine blade!

555
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,462
You're always messing up my store!

556
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,219
Don't think I won't get rid of your sister!

557
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:01,883
If you ever bully my sister,

558
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,062
you'll never have a good day again
for the rest of your life!

559
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,723
Why me?!

560
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:10,774
Everything's broken.

561
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,650
- Older brother, are you leaving?
- How will I even make the money back?

562
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,776
I'm coming back.

563
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:17,565
And when I'm back,

564
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,033
I'll have a lot of money.

565
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:23,868
I'll even be carried home on a litter
by a hundred men!

566
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,800
Ifl lose...

567
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,174
Please look the other way...

568
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,676
...and spare my friend.

569
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:44,634
Don't worry.

570
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,762
After I've defeated
Chang San the Divine Blade,

571
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,357
I'll retire to the country
and live a pastoral life.

572
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:33,597
This time...

573
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:37,472
I really have to retire to the country...
live a pastoral life...

574
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,935
I know...

575
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,273
I should have known from the start...

576
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:52,992
It was a conspiracy...!

577
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,495
I have never known... An Tien-Ming...

578
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,078
How could he know that this is where I live?

579
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,007
Why did he bait me to unsheath my sword?!

580
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,881
Someone is plotting against me!

581
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,964
Grandmaster, you suspect me?

582
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,640
But I am your most filial grand-pupil.

583
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,807
There is so much about you...

584
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,098
...I don't know even know...

585
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:26,812
My lord.

586
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,654
Chang San has already returned.

587
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:34,783
Brother Chang...!

588
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,035
Between the two of us,

589
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,408
all debts are paid.

590
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,001
Brother Chang unleashing his blade
is equal to having saved my life.

591
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,210
If you weren't there to help bury my mother,

592
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,260
your friends would still be alive today.

593
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,380
Brother Chang's sense of loyalty
is so apparent.

594
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,428
Like a shadow cast in the sun.

595
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,768
With his level of skill,

596
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,733
Chang San is more than capable
of handling Pai Chung-Tang.

597
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:09,480
Maybe.

598
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,859
To be so strongly
governed by your emotions:

599
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,235
it is a fatal weakness.

600
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,908
- Hurry up!
-A|right!

601
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,156
Here is good.

602
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,491
Hey, find a bigger table for us to sit at!

603
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:23,995
That one!

604
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,039
Bring the wine.

605
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,079
But do you still have money?

606
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:28,913
Nope.

607
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,839
But you know what to do.

608
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,841
Just give to us for now.

609
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,467
Drink the rainwater!

610
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,715
It's free!

611
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,422
Here!

612
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,091
Bring me the finest wine!

613
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,518
Right away! Right away!

614
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:44,895
- Brother San.
- Hey!

615
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,688
- Hey!
- Hey! Brother San!

616
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,854
- Hey! Brother San!
- Brother San!

617
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,109
Why're you so well-dressed?

618
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,778
- Wow!
- Nice clothes!

619
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,233
- You look completely different!
- So nice!

620
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,156
Hey, brother San.
Did you marry a wealthy widow?

621
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,198
Of course!

622
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,363
Wine's here! Wine's here!

623
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,784
Hey! Hey!

624
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,406
- Hey, I want wine too!
- Give me some wine!

625
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,706
No taking breaths in between.

626
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,128
What about taking a piss?

627
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,046
Nope.

628
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:44,655
Hey! Hey! Hey!

629
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,370
- No slacking off. Drink!
- No slacking off!

630
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:48,788
I'm
in!

631
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,957
Place your bets. All bets are final!

632
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:52,713
Place your bets! Place your bets!
Place your bets!

633
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,006
Bet big and win big!

634
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,921
Place your bets! Place your bets!

635
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,251
Bet big and you'll win!

636
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,461
Place your bets! Place your bets!

637
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,671
All bets are final!

638
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,963
We're off!

639
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:01,843
Oh, no!

640
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,552
Four-five-six, straight kill! Banker wins!

641
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,121
What're you doing?

642
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:30,793
My turn. My turn.

643
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,328
Drink! Drink! C'mon, drink!

644
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:45,758
I'm borrowing this.

645
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:46,558
Sure.

646
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:48,681
Hey!

647
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,056
Bet! Bet! Bet!

648
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,650
Bet big and win big!

649
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,022
Place your bets! Place your bets!

650
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,228
All bets are final!

651
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:57,853
We're off!

652
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,656
Four-five-six, straight kill! Banker wins!

653
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,737
Straight kill! Straight kill!

654
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,543
Fucking kid, who are you?!

655
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,165
Don't move!

656
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,125
- Surround him!
- Surround him!

657
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:16,671
Over there!

658
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,507
No wonder every game is four-five-six.

659
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,463
Con me will you?!

660
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,942
Hey now, no fighting.

661
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,578
With the exception of my mum,
nobody is allowed to con me!

662
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,082
Even your mum would con you?

663
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,336
She said my old man was a 72nd generation
grandchild of Emperor Ming of Tang.

664
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,213
You've got a pretty good ancestry then.

665
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:02,918
Hell no!

666
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,219
I've got 72 dads more like it!

667
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,717
So you're actually a bastard!

668
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,972
So what if I'm a bastard?!

669
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,597
Too bad one of my dads is the emperor!

670
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,101
Whatever you say, emperor boy.

671
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,489
You two... Who are you with?!

672
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,696
- And who are you with?
- And who are you with?

673
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,902
I'm one of Pai Chung-Tang's.

674
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,159
- Oh! Pai Chung-Tang.
- Oh! Pai Chung-Tang.

675
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,040
I've heard his wife is
50-something years old and still a virgin.

676
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,084
I think he's an arse bandit more like.

677
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:48,881
Big brother San!

678
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,929
- We're coming to help!
- We're coming!

679
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,884
Wow! It's really pouring!

680
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,042
I'm done playing.

681
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,259
I'm called Chang San (Anonymous).

682
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,759
You wouldn't happen to be
called Li Ssu (Incognito) would you?

683
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,603
Just call me Ching | (Green Clothes).

684
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,912
B-Big brother is the b-best!

685
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,365
G-G-Great kung fu!

686
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:02,872
- Big brother is amazing! The best!
- The best! The best!

687
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,843
All of you listen up!

688
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,971
Train your mind and spirit like mine!

689
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,382
Come out and train!

690
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:20,897
Get up!

691
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,849
The four of you get out here!

692
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:23,775
Get out here!

693
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,865
C'mon boss, you're lucky to get chosen.

694
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,321
If you're not going to hell,
who's going to hell?

695
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,368
Help us out here. Help us out!

696
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:42,619
Report...

697
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,959
We've got something to report, big brother!

698
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,460
Tell me after the fight!

699
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:48,792
Attack me!

700
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,342
Attack me!

701
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:03,731
Make your move!

702
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,148
Big brother, these two
will need a coffin real soon.

703
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,236
Get them to talk before closing the lid!

704
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,324
Coffin's still open till you talk.

705
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:20,624
Big brother, some guys
busted up our gambling den!

706
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,418
All our brothers have been beaten...

707
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,542
...black and blue...!

708
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,591
Who did this?!

709
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,223
One was called Chang San...
One was called Ching I...

710
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,686
This is not happening!

711
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,996
G-G-Good job! Big brother is the best!
The best!

712
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,244
Big brother... Have a rest.

713
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,037
Get lost!

714
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,048
Here big brother, have some wine.

715
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,714
What's the deal with those two kids?

716
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,293
Oh!

717
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,216
One is called Ching | the Life Taker.

718
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,931
He's the worst killer in all the land.

719
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,056
What about that Chang... whatever it is?

720
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:21,885
Chang...?

721
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,227
Oh!

722
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,101
Chang San the Divine Blade!

723
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,231
Apparently he's a friend of Kao Peng.

724
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:31,270
His Rusted Blade has already taken the lives
of all kings of the blade under heaven.

725
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,821
Furthermore, his skill
with a blade is truly...

726
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,115
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

727
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,404
- Is he really that skilled?!
- Kill! Kill!

728
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,656
Just average.

729
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,995
That fucking bastard Kao Peng...

730
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,413
I should've killed him
with my blade long ago.

731
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,168
Kill him.

732
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,389
Big brother, should we...
quickly send someone to kill him?

733
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,009
No!

734
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,759
I'll wait for them to come to me!

735
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,390
I managed to reclaim my mountain fortress
with just one hand!

736
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,187
I'm not scared of some brats!

737
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:11,935
My lord!

738
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,570
Don't... Don't do this!

739
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,397
Y-You... You mustn't do this!

740
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:16,239
My lord!

741
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:24,247
Why did he...?

742
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,205
My lord may have been too eager for revenge.

743
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,456
Overcome with grief...

744
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,373
He just couldn't take it anymore... so...

745
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:33,915
Brother Kao.

746
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,426
How did things come to this?

747
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,174
Affection is...
the affection of a father and a mother...

748
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:48,105
Vengeance...
is the vengeance of a sea of blood...

749
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:54,899
For each day... that I have not
killed Pai Chung-Tang...

750
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:02,244
I am not worthy... to face
those with whom I share this world...

751
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,115
Pai Chung-Tang is really
such a tough opponent?

752
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,953
Never has... he met his match...

753
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,292
My lord...

754
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,381
My lord... how do you feel?

755
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,054
Why were you so foolish?

756
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,729
As long as you, brother Kao,
stop trying to take your own life,

757
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,057
I will kill Pai Chung-Tang in your place!

758
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:32,853
Brother Chang!

759
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,984
This is my burden to bear!

760
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:38,696
Your burdens...

761
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,569
...are my burdens.

762
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,113
What's more...

763
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,784
This is the first time
someone has thought so highly of me.

764
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:47,489
Brother Chang...

765
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,423
I am born because of my father and mother.

766
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,848
I am saved because of... my friend.

767
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:09,640
Brother Chang!

768
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,264
Be careful...

769
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,412
You are waiting for something.

770
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,914
What are you waiting for?

771
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,921
When I used to do deeds,

772
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,878
I wouldn't even think twice.

773
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,551
But this time...

774
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,672
This time... your mind wanders
and you cannot make a decision?

775
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,801
You can stop deciding.

776
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:47,674
Just go.

777
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,483
The whole world knows that you're
fighting Pai Chung-Tai for Kao Peng's sake.

778
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,276
Such loyalty!

779
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:02,731
You know too.

780
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,699
They're waiting for you.

781
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,872
This is even more exciting
than attending a grand banquet.

782
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,625
If I were you,
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

783
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:24,924
Perhaps...

784
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:26,672
Life and death...

785
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,890
...aren't very important.

786
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,641
Before I kill...

787
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,103
...I always break out in a cold sweat.

788
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,238
If I don't drink some wine...

789
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,733
...I'll freeze to death from the cold sweat.

790
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,577
Don't just get caught up drinking!

791
01:01:58,924 --> 01:01:59,288
Now.

792
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,089
You have to know yourself,
and know those around you,

793
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:05,294
in order to claim a hundred victories
from a hundred battles.

794
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,003
This is Pai Villa.

795
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,344
There are thirty-six warriors
surrounding it from all sides.

796
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:11,929
The main gate.

797
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,604
It's guarded by the Yellow Weasel
and the Phantom Spear.

798
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,730
The two of them might be pushovers,

799
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,813
but we still need to be on guard;
even ants can swarm an elephant to death.

800
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,145
Have you seen the
deadly Spirit Reaper before?

801
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,571
In order to defeat this lot,
the two of us have to work together.

802
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,488
Us?

803
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,240
The two of us?!

804
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,001
What if something
unfortunate happens to you?

805
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,086
Who likes drinking with a dead man?

806
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,357
Mad Blade of the Sleeping Buddha.

807
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,776
His skill with a blade is inexplicable,
comes and goes like a phantasm.

808
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,524
How come you know everything in such detail?

809
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,571
I like poking my nose into things.

810
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,910
But the toughest one to beat...

811
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:14,621
...is Pai Chung-Tang.

812
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:41,601
You must...

813
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,941
...be wary of his final move.

814
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,484
Final move?

815
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,953
Even I don't know what it is.

816
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,756
You're such a resourceful fellow,
but even you couldn't find out.

817
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:13,842
Just remember...

818
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,474
Be wary of his final move.

819
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,222
Let's not dwell on today or tomorrow.

820
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,065
We still have wine to finish!

821
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,562
Let's save it for tomorrow!

822
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,486
I will keep the wine warm.

823
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,068
And I will wait for you to return tomorrow.

824
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:08,101
My lord, Chang San and Ching I
have already set off.

825
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,774
I expected nothing less.

826
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,696
My lord, we should send our men
and coordinate the attack with them.

827
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,620
Let us wait and see for the time the being.

828
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,238
Wait and see?!

829
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,453
If you want someone dead...

830
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,453
You don't have to hold the knife yourself.

831
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,479
Damn it!

832
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,190
I was hoping to live till 60.

833
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,192
Why not hope for 100?

834
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,733
Supposedly once you're over 60,

835
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,945
you grow weak in the arms and legs,
and feeble in the mind.

836
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,447
You can't do anything
even if you see a pretty girl.

837
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,324
60 sounds about right.

838
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,700
A real man is
unflinching in the face of death.

839
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,085
Sometimes... real men aren't worth a dime.

840
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:16,965
Where is everyone?

841
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:17,924
There's ghosts.

842
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,600
Even three-year-olds know
these two coffins aren't for dead people.

843
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,173
The ghost king waves his fan.

844
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:58,593
Go!

845
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,486
All the ghosts have disappeared.

846
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:23,028
Be careful of ghosts tapping on
the back of your head.

847
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:26,656
Clever move.

848
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,210
What are you doing?

849
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:32,787
Nothing.

850
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,752
Just checking if you have a chin.

851
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:39,677
It's the dead of night, so it's hard to tell
if someone's a human or a ghost.

852
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,681
C'mon boss, stop messing around!

853
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:56,898
Watch out!

854
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,696
The Phantom Spear has no eyes.

855
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,259
Any ideas on how to stop ghosts?

856
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,763
Have them fight each other.

857
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,559
How come you suck more than a ghost?!

858
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,307
How can you drink now?

859
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,390
Do you fancy your life being too long?

860
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,350
I'm not afraid of dying unlike you.

861
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,360
I've always only been afraid of two things:

862
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,734
One, dying tragically. Two, dying drunk.

863
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,867
Dying drunk seems
really straightfoward though.

864
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,285
There are many different kinds of dying.

865
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,536
Dying inexplicably, without any idea of
the why and how wouldn't be worthwhile.

866
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,163
If you're going to die, die with some worth.

867
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,584
Hey! Why haven't we seen Pai Chung-Tang?

868
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,631
Yeah, get him to come outside... idiot.

869
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,593
One final sweep?

870
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:21,376
Let's go!

871
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:31,841
Ching I!

872
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,236
Hey! Are you alright?

873
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,237
Not dead yet, right?

874
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,364
Ithink I'm almost done.

875
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,123
Boss!

876
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,960
If you like fooling around so much,
why don't you make a living from it?

877
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,011
My mum fools around for a living!

878
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:27,540
Hey.

879
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:19,443
Good game!

880
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:25,704
Tell me, for my last move of the game...
what kind of move should I make?

881
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,869
Hire some men to do it.

882
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,042
And you can sit here and reap
the benefits of their work.

883
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:31,747
Right.

884
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:35,133
Hurry and up and fetch the men.

885
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,220
Why are you still here?

886
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,681
The senior Lord Kao used to conduct himself
in way that is completely different to you.

887
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,403
He was a righteous man
who would take matters into his own hands.

888
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,607
That's how he became the
number one boss throughout the land.

889
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,159
His generation has passed.

890
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,578
You are my subordinate, are you not?!

891
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,746
If I say this is how something goes,
you are in no position to talk back!

892
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:12,751
Do you understand?

893
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,803
It's no wonder your master once said:

894
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,972
"There is so much about you...

895
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,595
...that I don't even know."

896
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:35,902
There's nobody here.

897
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,000
Hey!

898
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:52,832
We're on the same side!

899
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:58,167
But I'm certain I saw something
on your backjust now.

900
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:58,671
What?

901
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:04,514
No there's not!

902
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,681
What am I, a hunchback?

903
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,115
On his back like a dead snake.

904
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,541
Sleeping Buddha of the Blade.

905
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,914
His body sleeps,
but his mind is wide awake.

906
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,085
He's not so tough!

907
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,429
He woke up.

908
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,772
He's gone from Sleeping Buddha
to Swollen Buddha.

909
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,270
I'm not so scared now.

910
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,469
Is he dead yet?

911
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,009
It's hard to say.

912
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,471
His dead face is about the same
as his sleeping one.

913
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,456
Save it!

914
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,380
It's more comfortable over there.

915
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,481
How can this old geezer be so fierce?

916
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:37,532
We can't die here.

917
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,698
We're in a hurry to go back drinking.

918
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,033
Attack his throat!

919
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,209
Sulphur solution?!

920
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,598
You're... You're not kidding around are you?

921
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:37,731
Kidding around...

922
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,437
Now is not the time.

923
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:41,772
Why?

924
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,404
Kao Peng gave me 500 taels.

925
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,406
Told me to bring back your head.

926
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:49,075
Kao Peng?

927
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:51,991
When you are useful...

928
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:53,872
...you are his friend.

929
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:56,366
When your usefulness is up...

930
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:58,994
...you are nothing but trash.

931
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:01,163
Is this...

932
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,502
...what the final move is?

933
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,928
I told you right from the start to be wary.

934
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,263
When it comes to my friends...

935
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,223
...I am never ever wary.

936
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,935
This is why you and I...

937
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:17,763
...are destined for failure.

938
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,191
Will there be...

939
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:23,852
...another move?

940
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:24,728
Yes!

941
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:27,401
A third move. A fourth move.

942
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,861
When it comes to friendship
there are just too many moves.

943
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,325
You just...

944
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,828
...can't defend against them all.

945
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,270
Where's the sword?!

946
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,648
I always knew you were plotting something!

947
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,039
Where's the sword?

948
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:28,333
My sword...

949
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,801
...is only for those of noble character!

950
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:32,086
My character...

951
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,464
...is not something for you to judge!

952
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,720
Where's the sword?

953
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:39,178
The sword is not something you can see!

954
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,428
You have eyes...

955
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,897
...but you may as well have none!

956
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:44,228
You have a heart...

957
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:46,734
...but you may as well have none!

958
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:29,853
Give me back the sword!

959
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:30,566
You...!

960
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,025
Give me back my sword!

961
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,351
Grandmaster would never fully recover.

962
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,144
Weary of his existence,
he took his own life.

963
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:22,205
And here I thought I found
someone else like me.

964
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,661
In the end it was just another dream.

965
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:28,753
Dreams...

966
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,581
Usually nothing comes from them.

967
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,381
So it's just like my love for you?

968
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,472
I've told you before...

969
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,896
Don't fall in love with a drifter.

970
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,480
In your world...

971
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,818
...there is only life and death.

972
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:54,695
It is cold.

973
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:56,943
But there is no warmth.

974
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:00,781
There are pursuits.

975
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,660
But nothing comes from them.

976
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,956
I'm not the kind of person
who likes to dream.

977
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:09,627
Because...

978
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:14,040
...I'm always very aware
of what it is I'm doing.

979
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:14,715
Older brother...

980
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:17,718
You said that when you came back,

981
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,923
you'll be carried home on a litter
by a hundred men.

982
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,048
Who would have thought...

983
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:36,237
What is it?

984
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,160
Chang San is already dead.

985
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,205
Help me tie my sash.

986
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:55,874
Are you a cripple?!

987
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:01,630
Yes.

988
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,508
I have already become numb.

989
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:07,135
To you.

990
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,146
To your so-called vengeance and indignation.

991
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,016
The truth is...

992
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,858
Everything has been for the sake
of furthering your own ambitions!

993
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,359
Through underhanded means no less!

994
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:36,964
Master!

995
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:38,670
Did you know,

996
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:40,627
that the creation of a hero...

997
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,220
...requires many people to die.

998
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,174
I only know that in your dad's generation,

999
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,555
people spoke of promises...

1000
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:50,811
...and of real loyalty!

1001
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:57,902
Truth be told, his Kao Villa was plundered
by killing and pillaging all the same.

1002
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:01,902
Once a person has achieved success,

1003
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:06,907
even past acts of killing and pillaging
can be retold as the deeds of a hero.

1004
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,700
Besides...

1005
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:13,752
Eventually I will become the great hero
of the second generation of Chungyuan!

1006
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:15,252
Look at them.

1007
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,715
All of them are kneeling there
so faithfully.

1008
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,968
Except for just a handful of them...

1009
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:24,963
They're bought and paid for!

1010
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,224
Aside from following me
you have no other way forward!

1011
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,893
The deeper I understand you...

1012
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:35,102
...the further away from you I need to go.

1013
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:36,728
You should know:

1014
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:39,986
Submit to me and prosper,
oppose me and perish!

1015
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,981
First you sacrificed our
Kao Villa brothers.

1016
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:45,488
And then there was brother Wang.

1017
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:46,488
Grandmaster.

1018
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,118
Chang San.

1019
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:51,369
You won't even spare a fly!

1020
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,497
I order you to stay!

1021
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:59,206
You have no need for friends at all!

1022
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:20,401
My brothers.

1023
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,566
Let us help one another.

1024
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,193
When Iyour lord revive Kao Villa,

1025
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,067
the fortunes that we make
will be shared equally by all of us.

1026
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,278
The land that we claim
will be lived on equally by all of us.

1027
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,158
Thank you, master!

1028
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,174
I see you've kept your promise.

1029
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:31,806
When talking business,
there's only the language of promises.

1030
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,049
That's right!

1031
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,013
Where's my 500 taels?

1032
01:35:39,275 --> 01:35:41,516
The words of a gentleman are never empty.

1033
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:43,976
Come and get it.

1034
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,482
The way I see it...

1035
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,484
Shouldn't we keep some distance between us?

1036
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:56,826
Stop!

1037
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,303
You probably don't know
the rules of our trade.

1038
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,635
Killing for a job:

1039
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,264
Kill with a single cut.

1040
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:19,638
Those who don't keep promises:

1041
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,476
Kill with 1,000 cuts.

1042
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,106
I also have a rule of the trade:

1043
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,324
If I want you to die...

1044
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,402
You will have to die.

1045
01:38:03,503 --> 01:38:04,208
Kao Peng!

1046
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:05,667
This move...

1047
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,420
Even you couldn't anticipate it!

1048
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:08,663
Truly...

1049
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,045
Truly a master stroke.

1050
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,516
In this world, true friends do exist!

1051
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,189
Will there be...

1052
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:28,891
...another move?

1053
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:30,025
Yes.

1054
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:32,979
A third move.

1055
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,440
A fourth move.

1056
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:39,239
When it comes to friendship...

1057
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,870
...there are just too many moves.

1058
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:44,703
You just...

1059
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,080
...can't defend against them all.

1060
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,094
I think there's one thing you overlooked:

1061
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:00,723
I've never managed
to wrap up any of my jobs.

1062
01:39:01,727 --> 01:39:02,341
That's why...

1063
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,310
you'll always be unlucky!

1064
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:04,977
That's right.

1065
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,058
It's cos I met you.

1066
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,150
I underestimated the two of you.

1067
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,657
And I used to overestimate you!

1068
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:20,401
Yes...

1069
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,531
I deserve to be put on a pedestal.

1070
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:26,991
Because I am superior to all!

1071
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,129
Why don't you lock yourself up
in a birdcage then?

1072
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:48,562
Ching I!

1073
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:53,656
When we used to cross paths, it was fate

1074
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:59,164
With our hearts as one
we wielded our blades, destroying the enemy

1075
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:05,372
Blood and arrows filled the sky,
a sight that became commonplace

1076
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:10,422
We crossed thousands of mountains,
swallowed up by the wind and the rain

1077
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:16,345
As suddenly as we would meet,
we would also part ways

1078
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:22,142
We are both drifters of the lakes and the seas,
but our destinies take different paths

1079
01:45:22,608 --> 01:45:28,228
To live through a hundred misfortunes
is my own solitary path

1080
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:34,696
How much bitterness and difficulty
have I faced?

1081
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:41,491
The thousands of praise in this world,

1082
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:47,296
Will become envy and disdain tomorrow!

1083
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:53,177
With pride and mirth,
roam the world as a wanderer!

1084
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:57,264
But the fame and fortune of such a life
dissolves into sentiment and sorrow

1085
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:02,595
So now we meet again, just like old times

1086
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:08,727
To think that the light of our blades
is now full of hate

1087
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:14,820
I long to cast away this iron sword,
but, alas, lam unable

1088
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:20,496
In the chaotic rain and the frigid wind,
I have such resentments!

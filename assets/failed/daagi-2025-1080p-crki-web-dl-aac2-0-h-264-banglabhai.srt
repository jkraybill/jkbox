1
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,666
Here's your ID card.

2
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,125
And your wallet.

3
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,750
Three hundred and twenty-eight.

4
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,041
Sign here.

5
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,833
A lot has changed
in the last 14 years.

6
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,291
Don't lose your temper.

7
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,250
Always keep your cool.

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,250
Stay out of trouble.

9
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,000
Or you'll be blamed
because of your past.

10
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,125
Be very careful.

11
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,541
Repeat after me.

12
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,750
- Everything's beautiful in Allah's world.
- Everything's beautiful.

13
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,708
- The trees and leaves.
- The trees and leaves.

14
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,666
- The light and the air.
- The light and the air.

15
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,375
- The seas and the oceans.
- The seas and oceans.

16
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,833
- Everything's magical in Allah's world.
- Everything's magical in Allah's world.

17
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,833
Goodbye.

18
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,875
Bye.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,958
Take care.

20
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,041
You too.

21
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,875
DAAGI

22
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,291
- Ride available?
- Yes.

23
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,458
- Nazir Road.
- Nazir Road?

24
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,583
Where's that?

25
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,791
It's next to Mizan Road.

26
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,041
That's Alia Madrasa Road.

27
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,583
Want to go there?

28
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,375
Alia Madrasa Road...

29
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,958
- Take me there.
- Okay, come.

30
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,583
Stop here.

31
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,166
Fifty bucks.

32
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,125
Speak up!

33
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:20,666
No!

34
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,500
Everything's beautiful in Allah's world.

35
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:30,916
Everything's beautiful in Allah's world.

36
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:36,000
Everything's beautiful in Allah's world...

37
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,416
Nishan?

38
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,041
They released you?

39
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,500
Yes.

40
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,375
Nishan!

41
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,708
Nishan, my son!

42
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,875
My Nishan...

43
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,291
My Nishan is back.

44
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,208
Sit, my dear.

45
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,458
Come on, sit.

46
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,541
Please.

47
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,333
They let you go.

48
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,333
No one informed me about it.

49
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,916
My son.

50
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,041
Will you have some juice?

51
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,708
Lime juice?

52
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,375
I'll make some for you.

53
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,333
Got an early release?

54
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,666
On the occasion of Victory Day.

55
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,583
What has that got to do with it?

56
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,041
You still have
eight months to serve.

57
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,416
Did they really let you go?

58
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes, Dad.
I didn't escape.

59
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,416
They let me go.

60
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,666
This room will be locked
from now on.

61
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:14,208
"We rant and rage
but no one pays heed.

62
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,250
Why speak of God...

63
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,125
when none feels the need?"

64
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,208
- Excellent!
- Beautiful!

65
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,583
Hey, Nishan.

66
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,833
Do you want to learn
the whole poem?

67
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,958
Or just a few lines?

68
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,833
Boss, a few lines will do.

69
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,500
Recite the lines to your girlfriend.

70
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,625
She'll hug you and say...

71
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,666
"Come, let's make love".

72
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,375
She doesn't want to make love.

73
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,250
Only wants to get married.

74
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,583
Careful.

75
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,166
Make it fast.

76
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,208
My girlfriend is waiting
in Saidpur.

77
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,708
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

78
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,625
- Let me go!
- No.

79
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,625
- Let me go!
- What the--

80
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,250
Getting all romantic
after being away for 10 days.

81
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,541
Not 10.
Seven days.

82
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,791
- Where were you?
- I told you.

83
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,291
Had to go to the border
for some work.

84
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,333
You could've called me.

85
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,041
How would I?
What if your dad answered?

86
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,500
And calls don't get through
from India.

87
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,750
You could've told me
you wouldn't be here.

88
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,416
Let's continue the fight
at Babu's place.

89
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,750
No!
I'm not going anywhere.

90
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,666
We'll stay right here today.

91
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,625
I don't like it here.

92
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,833
Such a boring place.
Only trees and animals.

93
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,000
I know what you like.

94
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,458
You've really taken me for granted.

95
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,000
We're not going to Babu's house.

96
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,083
- We'll be here today.
- What?

97
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,708
"If the heart hurts...

98
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,416
If the heart hurts, we seek a cure.

99
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,541
But what if the heart
is the cause of pain?"

100
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,375
Stop it.
Had enough of Ghalib's poetry.

101
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,083
"A hundred moons may shine..."

102
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,875
Nishan, my family is looking
for a groom.

103
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:41,416
"A hundred moons may shine
yet none can match your light.

104
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:46,250
A hundred moons may shine
yet none can match your light.

105
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,708
For only in your presence
does the night feel bright."

106
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,958
A thousand moons may shine
but the night is still dark

107
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,333
if you don't grace it
with your presence.

108
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,458
The night is meaningless without you.

109
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,708
Come on.

110
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,458
Let's go to Babu's house.

111
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,750
You men have only one thing
on your mind.

112
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,250
Please let's go to Babu's place.

113
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,416
Come on.

114
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,625
Hang on!

115
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,083
- Hurry up.
- Get in.

116
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,041
- Dad has gone out.
- Quick.

117
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,750
- Close the door.
- Oh!

118
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,500
I'll be back in an hour.

119
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,208
It's just us!

120
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,458
Babu!

121
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,333
Babu!

122
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,958
Open the door.

123
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,041
I've left my office keys behind.

124
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,541
- I told you!
- Quiet.

125
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,625
I have to take my keys.

126
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,291
Open up fast.

127
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,625
Hey, Babu!

128
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,083
What?
Hey!

129
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,625
- What did you break? Open--
- Dad.

130
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,208
When did you come?

131
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,083
You're here?

132
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,208
- Who's inside?
- Who's inside?

133
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,875
- What?
- I heard a glass break.

134
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,583
- What?
- It's a thief.

135
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,000
- No.
- Yes!

136
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,000
- Hey, come out!
- Dad, quiet.

137
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,541
I'll go catch the thief.

138
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,958
Stay right here.
Don't move.

139
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,500
- I'll check.
- Okay.

140
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,458
- Why is he here?
- Use the back door. This way.

141
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,625
Dad, hold on.

142
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,541
- Caught the thief?
- There's no one.

143
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,958
I'm sure it was a cat.
There's no one.

144
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,875
Hey, wait!

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let me go!

146
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,958
I'm not going anywhere with you.

147
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,625
Not until we're married.

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,875
Either marry me or break up!

149
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,125
Damn it!

150
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,083
If you choose me by mistake

151
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,000
If you stay with me by chance

152
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,416
I'll still smile gazing into your eyes

153
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,166
If dusk falls
when I'm lost in your thoughts

154
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,208
If my eyes well up
like a quiet, flowing river

155
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:01,583
I'll forget all my pride
and come back to you

156
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:10,458
How will you go leaving me behind?

157
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:18,625
Who will love you the way I do?

158
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,208
Let me feel your touch

159
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:28,375
Give me a piece of your heart

160
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,250
For the world knows
in this birth

161
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:38,416
My life is empty without you

162
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,416
Let me feel your touch

163
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,625
Give me a piece of your heart

164
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,750
For the world knows
in this birth

165
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:58,666
My life is empty without you

166
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,916
FRESHERS' WELCOME 2008

167
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,041
Now the pride of Saidpur
to present the awards.

168
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,750
Please welcome gold medallist,
Nasiruzzaman Sohag.

169
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,916
Only jobless fools become toppers.

170
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,416
Go.

171
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:46,166
As I keep waiting for you

172
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,125
My heart feels like a barren sky

173
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,416
I forget all my pain
and drift into a world of dreams

174
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,000
Nishan, wait!

175
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,708
Where were you
for the last seven days?

176
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,625
Not seven.
Four days.

177
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,500
- Where were you?
- India.

178
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,208
India?
Stop lying.

179
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,375
Who will love you the way I do?

180
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:18,000
Let me feel your touch

181
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:22,250
Give me a piece of your heart

182
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,166
For the world knows
in this birth

183
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:32,208
My life is empty without you

184
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,541
Let me feel your touch

185
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,541
Give me a piece of your heart

186
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,750
For the world knows
in this birth

187
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,583
My life is empty without you

188
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,666
For the world knows
in this birth

189
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:09,000
My life is empty without you

190
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,625
It's quite late.

191
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,833
Lunch is ready.

192
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,291
Where's the chutney?

193
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,041
When do your exams start?

194
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,416
What exams?

195
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,625
College finals.

196
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,125
You don't even know.

197
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,291
What's your aim in life?

198
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,500
What are you going to do?

199
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,250
What else?

200
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,916
I'll do export-import business.

201
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,250
I'll import items from India
and sell them here.

202
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,291
Huge profit!

203
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,875
Is that so easy?

204
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,041
Everyone in Saidpur
would've done the same.

205
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,500
But they don't have contacts
like I do.

206
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,041
I'm not made for desk jobs.

207
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,708
Why would you be?

208
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,458
Jobs are meant for idiots.

209
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,708
Like me.

210
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,250
- "Like me."
- Let him eat.

211
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,041
What's wrong in doing business?

212
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,125
Your dad was businessman too.

213
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,500
But he's right.

214
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,125
He's an idiot.

215
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,125
- Mom, I'm hungry.
- Hey!

216
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,083
Why are you shouting?

217
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,416
- Mom!
- "Mom!"

218
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey, Zarine.
How are you?

219
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,208
- How's your mom?
- Hello.

220
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,500
Mom is fine.

221
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,958
I was nearby for some work.

222
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,416
I know, I know.

223
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,208
You're here to see your idiot.

224
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,291
Carry on.

225
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,916
Come with me.

226
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,083
- Dad's here--
- They've found me a groom.

227
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,958
A doctor or an engineer?

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The most eligible bachelor
in Saidpur.

229
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,708
They're going to fix my wedding
in two weeks.

230
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,416
Dad has approved of him.

231
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,958
I won't be able to stop it.

232
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,208
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

233
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,958
- Nishan.
- Yes?

234
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,791
Come over on the 15th.

235
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,916
I'll speak to Dad.

236
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,291
You don't have to do anything.

237
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:20,041
Please just come over.
I'll handle the rest.

238
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,791
Who's the most eligible bachelor
in Saidpur?

239
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,458
He needs everything right now.

240
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,541
So annoying!

241
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,458
- Carry on.
- I'll get married to him.

242
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,500
Go ahead.

243
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,166
How dare you?

244
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,041
- Huh?
- It's...

245
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,708
It's hurting.

246
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,500
Nadia!

247
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,750
I'll beat you up!

248
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,541
What?

249
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,750
See you on the 15th.

250
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,041
Don't miss it.

251
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,666
Please!

252
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,875
Stop.

253
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,000
- Who is it?
- Babu, it's me.

254
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,375
- What happened, Zarine?
- Where's Nishan?

255
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,625
He's in India.

256
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,458
Can't get through to him.

257
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,583
He didn't even call me once.

258
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,458
He's in Agartala.
Must be having network issues.

259
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,041
When will he return?

260
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,666
I don't know.

261
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,666
- You don't know?
- No.

262
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,041
Zarine, what's wrong?

263
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,666
Zarine!

264
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:43,875
A hundred moons may shine
but it means nothing

265
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,500
if you don't grace it.

266
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,833
The night means nothing
without you.

267
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,791
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

268
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,708
- You're...
- Zarine.

269
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,500
Right, Zarine.

270
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,583
How can I help you?

271
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,500
- Want to send a money order?
- Where's Nishan, uncle?

272
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,625
Sit.

273
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,500
You can't build a home with him.

274
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,833
I know him very well.

275
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,041
He doesn't know
what he wants from life.

276
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,375
He's not serious about anything.

277
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,250
You were classmates.

278
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,416
You completed your graduation.

279
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,791
But Nishan dropped out.

280
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,791
He wants to do business.

281
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,833
Make easy money and become rich.

282
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,500
Maybe he'll forget the difference
between right and wrong some day.

283
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,416
Don't wait for Nishan.

284
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,500
Find a nice guy and get married.

285
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,708
Zarine is going meet her groom today.

286
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,333
Go empty-handed this time.

287
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,666
She's her dad's only child.

288
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,125
Her dad will kick me out
if I go empty-handed.

289
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,083
I have to take something for him.

290
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:38,958
You remind me of my younger self.

291
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,000
Boss.

292
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,916
Did you think about my proposal?

293
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,041
If you work with Ranjit Singh...

294
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,833
you can't defy my orders.

295
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,000
You'll always be under my control.

296
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,000
"In sorrow's clenched fist...

297
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,500
- In sorrow's clenched fist--"
- "My life is but sand.

298
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,750
The tighter the grip...

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,375
the more it slips from my hand."

300
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,250
This is why...

301
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,083
I like you so much.

302
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,291
Get up.

303
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,541
Make up your mind.

304
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,500
This is not grocery shopping.

305
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,208
It's a fancy deal.

306
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,125
You'll go in for 14 years
if you get caught.

307
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,791
I need money.

308
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,625
I've made up my mind.

309
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,041
Okay.

310
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,083
There's unrest at the border.

311
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,291
Get on with it when the dust settles.

312
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,041
Rabi.

313
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,291
- Rabi.
- Coming!

314
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,166
Yes, boss.

315
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,041
This is Nishan.

316
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,083
- Hi.
- He'll deliver the item.

317
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,708
You'll go with him
after two weeks.

318
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,625
He's a fresher.
A newcomer.

319
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,833
If he screws up...

320
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,083
Don't worry.

321
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,583
I'm a seasoned guy.

322
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,208
Stop, stop, stop.

323
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,333
Get down.

324
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,458
Relax.

325
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,458
Do you see the light there?

326
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,000
It will be back here in two minutes.

327
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,541
You have two minutes to run.

328
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,458
If you fail,
we'll have to abort the task.

329
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,875
Keep the flashlight.

330
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,333
But don't turn it on.

331
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,125
Or you'll be done for.

332
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,541
Be careful.

333
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:02,166
Run! Run! Run!

334
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,750
Come on.

335
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,083
Watch out!

336
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,833
Run!

337
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,000
Hurry up.
Tuhin!

338
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,541
Nishan!

339
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,708
Hello.

340
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,250
Come downstairs, Babu.

341
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,208
Why?

342
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,208
Come fast.

343
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay.

344
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,416
What happened?
What's wrong?

345
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:11,291
- Give me a shirt.
- Where were you?

346
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,875
Didn't I warn you?

347
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,416
Didn't I tell you it was too risky?

348
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,166
What if you got shot?

349
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,291
- Why do you have to do this?
- I'm fine!

350
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,541
My dad...

351
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,000
won't invest in my business.

352
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,333
I will crack a big deal.

353
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,750
Then use the money
to start an import-export business.

354
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,666
- Do you get it?
- I do.

355
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,041
What will you do then?

356
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,333
Zarine's dad won't accept me
if I don't earn well.

357
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,416
- I'll save money--
- Zarine got married.

358
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,375
What?

359
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,750
Zarine got married.

360
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,333
To whom?

361
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:51,833
Sohag.

362
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,166
Last Friday.

363
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,541
They're moving to Canada
so they rushed the wedding.

364
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,000
Nishan!

365
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,083
- Zarine! Zarine!
- No, Nishan... Please...

366
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:19,208
- What's wrong?  Who are you?
- Zarine!

367
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,208
- Zarine, come out.
- What's going on?

368
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,750
- Let go of me!
- Everyone's watching.

369
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,083
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

370
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,541
Zarine.

371
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,541
- How could you?
- Nishan...

372
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:29,875
- How?
- Let's go.

373
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,375
- How could you?
- Let's talk inside.

374
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:33,791
- Answer me.
- Come on!

375
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:36,625
- How could you do this to me?
- She'll be disgraced.

376
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:38,416
Let's sit and talk.

377
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,541
- How could you?
- Stop it--

378
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,458
Don't you dare touch me!

379
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,458
How could you do this to me?
How?

380
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,083
Stop it, Nishan.

381
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,166
- Cheater!
- Please let's go.

382
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,125
Bloody cheater!

383
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,125
Traitor!

384
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,500
Come on.

385
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,458
Nishan, don't do this.

386
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,625
- How could you do this?
- Nishan, quiet.

387
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,625
- Come on!
- Let me go!

388
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,750
- How could she?
- Come on.

389
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,208
Is he the guy you told me about?

390
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,250
You said he isn't serious
about you.

391
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,916
But didn't seem like it.

392
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,583
You think I lied to you?

393
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,291
Why would you lie to me?

394
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,500
- I didn't hide anything from you.
- Zarine.

395
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,375
- I told you I'm not a virgin.
- No, I--

396
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,500
Called him right in front of you.

397
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:44,166
- You know everything.
- Zarine--

398
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,458
Why are you getting mad at me?

399
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,958
It has hurt his ego.

400
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,041
He thinks he's lost.

401
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,750
He'll forget it all by tomorrow.

402
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,916
You need to end this.

403
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,625
You both need closure.

404
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,875
We don't need anything.

405
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:24,291
Believe me.
He'll forget everything tomorrow.

406
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,916
Zarine, I feel...

407
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,458
I've come between you guys.

408
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,291
I've ruined your relationship.

409
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,875
Come.

410
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,375
Careful.

411
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,333
This way.

412
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,541
Nishan.

413
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,375
Nishan.

414
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,791
I didn't get to introduce myself.

415
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,708
I'm Sohag.

416
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,875
Let me talk.

417
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,833
He knows who you are.

418
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:44,125
My husband and I are here
to clear something up.

419
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,958
He knows we were in a relationship.

420
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,166
I didn't hide anything from him.

421
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,250
But he thinks he's breaking us up.

422
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,583
I told him he's wrong.

423
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,791
Congratulations.

424
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:01,416
Thank you.

425
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,166
Can you give me five minutes
with her?

426
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,375
No.

427
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,583
We'll talk in front of him.

428
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,666
We have nothing to talk about
in private.

429
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:13,833
Four minutes?

430
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,708
You need my permission
to talk to me.

431
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,625
Three minutes?

432
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:22,958
Zarine, talk it out.

433
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,375
Please.

434
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,541
End it.

435
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:32,458
Babu, come with me.

436
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,458
Let's go.

437
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,375
I won't let you go.

438
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,791
Let me go.

439
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,041
Let me go, Nishan.

440
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,750
Why...

441
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,916
Why did you leave me?

442
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:13,916
- How could you dump me?
- Let me go.

443
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,041
Nishan, let me go!

444
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,250
You're drunk?

445
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,041
Huh?

446
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,458
Let me go.

447
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:29,500
"A hundred moons may shine
yet none can match your light.

448
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,416
For only in your presence
does the night feel bright."

449
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,291
Beautiful!
Wow!

450
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,875
I won't let you go.

451
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,291
Move.

452
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,416
- I have to go.
- Hey, listen.

453
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,583
Nishan, I'll scream!
Let me go.

454
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,083
He, why are you closing the door?

455
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,916
Keep the door open.

456
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,791
Don't force me to shout!

457
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,041
See.

458
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:07,875
Look.

459
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:13,625
I survived a shootout
just to come back to you.

460
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,541
Don't dump me.

461
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,125
How could you just leave me?

462
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:26,333
- Let me go.
- Please don't leave me.

463
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:29,708
I don't accept this marriage.
I'll marry you today.

464
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,375
I'm begging you.
Please don't kill me.

465
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,375
- Please, Zarine.
- Let go of me.

466
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,250
I waited for you.
But you didn't come.

467
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,250
Now let me go.

468
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,333
Now I'm a married woman.

469
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:44,041
My husband is waiting for me.
Let me go.

470
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,000
He...

471
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:50,750
Sohag has tainted you.

472
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:52,958
I...

473
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,250
- I'll make you pure again.
- Nishan, no...

474
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:27,541
Zarine?

475
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:30,958
- Zarine!
- Nishan!

476
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,625
- Nishan, open the door.
- Open up, Zarine!

477
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,125
Open the door.

478
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,500
Zarine!

479
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,125
Open the--

480
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:41,833
What happened?

481
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:43,416
Zarine?

482
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,500
Bloody scoundrel!

483
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,416
Son of a b---h!

484
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,541
What did you do to her?

485
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,041
Why did you close the door?

486
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,291
Speak up!

487
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,208
Bloody rascal!
Why did you close the door?

488
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,208
Get lost!

489
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,208
Nishan!

490
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,041
Nishan!

491
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,000
This monster...

492
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,791
...killed my son!

493
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,375
You'll rot in hell!

494
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:53,333
Give back my son!

495
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,750
Nishan must be hanged!

496
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,500
- Nishan must be hanged!
- Nishan must be hanged!

497
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:59,375
He pushed Sohag off the terrace.

498
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,500
Your Honour, Zarine called him.

499
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,000
Sohag and Nishan were talking.
It was just an accident.

500
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,875
- Nishan must be hanged!
- Nishan must be hanged!

501
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,916
Nishan...

502
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,208
Nishan...

503
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,541
Nishan...

504
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,666
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

505
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,583
You here?

506
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,250
- When did you get out of jail?
- Uncle...

507
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,500
Babu.

508
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,000
Nishan?

509
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,333
Nishan!

510
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,000
How are you?

511
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,333
How have you been?

512
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,791
I did my time right...

513
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,833
so they reduced my sentence.

514
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:34,625
Oh, I see.

515
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,541
I'm very sorry, buddy.

516
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,333
I didn't check in on you
for a long time.

517
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,875
You did visit me a few times.

518
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,958
My dad...

519
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,458
didn't show up even once.

520
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:53,916
Hey.

521
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,041
You took the final exams, right?

522
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,083
Yes, twice.

523
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,375
But couldn't continue my studies
in jail.

524
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,291
Prison is...

525
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,083
a hellhole.

526
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,333
Everyone wants to
have an upper hand over you.

527
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:19,541
They sniff out your weakness
from a mile away.

528
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:27,875
Then gradually...

529
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,541
your soul dies.

530
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,458
Ranjit sent me.

531
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,875
Prison changes you.

532
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,000
A good person becomes bad.

533
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,833
And a bad person becomes evil.

534
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,791
Guilt feels like a heavy rock

535
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,916
sitting on your chest.

536
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,375
I've prayed for only one thing
these 14 years.

537
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,458
That I don't die there.

538
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,500
Not like a criminal.

539
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,708
I've ruined so many lives.

540
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,833
Zarine.

541
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:28,916
Sohag's mom.

542
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:31,625
My grandma.

543
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,666
My dad.

544
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,416
I hope they forgive me.

545
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,375
Until I've atoned for my sins...

546
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,833
I won't be free.

547
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,500
I have only one wish.

548
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,375
I want...

549
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,000
things to be as they were.

550
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:08,541
Buddy.

551
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,291
Where does Zarine live now?

552
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,791
Her dad got a transfer to Cox's Bazar
soon after.

553
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,083
We haven't been in touch since then.

554
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:30,208
Sohag's mom lives with her daughter
in Dhaka.

555
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,041
She comes here sometimes.

556
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,958
I don't keep track of them.

557
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,625
Hello, Commissioner.

558
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,333
Hello.

559
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,500
Has Nishan been released?

560
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,750
Yes, today.

561
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:08,333
Did he come back home?

562
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,125
Yes.

563
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,333
Why?
Why is he back home?

564
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,708
I don't understand...
Where else would he go?

565
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:17,250
Somewhere else.
He should be in Dhaka.

566
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,583
He's not an ordinary criminal.

567
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,750
Everyone knows what he did.

568
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:23,916
And they're talking already.

569
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,208
Commissioner.

570
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,000
He's been punished for his crime.

571
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:29,875
He's served his time.

572
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,291
He was punished by the law.
But society is yet to forgive him.

573
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,125
Ask him to leave for Dhaka.

574
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,583
The world is cruel.

575
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,000
People will say a lot of things.

576
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,791
Don't pay heed to them.

577
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,291
Don't run after easy money.

578
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:49,833
Work hard.

579
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,583
Try to find a purpose in life.

580
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,125
Life is like riding a cycle.

581
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:00,166
You have to keep going
if you don't want to fall.

582
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,166
I hope you’ve learnt that by now.

583
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:19,875
You haven't met Nadia's husband.

584
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:23,416
Go over for a few days.

585
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,875
Get a haircut and shave before you go.

586
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,125
Be like the Nishan we knew.

587
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:30,916
Here you go.

588
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,708
Keep my phone.

589
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:35,458
Till you buy a new one.

590
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:36,750
Here.

591
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,541
And keep the money.
You'll need it.

592
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:41,875
Get going.

593
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,583
Turn left, please.

594
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,958
But we're headed this way.

595
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,125
Do as I say.

596
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,708
Pull over.

597
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:04,000
- Make sure we get the tender.
- I'll take care of it.

598
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,458
How's the sweet?

599
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,708
- Great!
- Delicious.

600
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,125
Nadia.

601
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,583
Brother!

602
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,166
It's been so long.

603
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,916
I told Mom so many times.

604
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,916
I wanted to go meet you.

605
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,791
But she didn't let me.

606
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,791
Now I'm here.

607
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,458
Russel, this is my brother.

608
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,125
Hello.

609
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,541
Come here.

610
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,041
How are you?

611
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:38,791
I'm good.

612
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,666
- Sit, I'll get you some juice.
- Sure.

613
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:45,875
He is the exigence officer
at Water Development Board.

614
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,208
- And his wife.
- Hello.

615
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,041
I do the contractual work
in his office.

616
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,500
- Please sit.
- Sure.

617
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,208
Seems like you met your sister
after a long time.

618
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,208
Yes.

619
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,208
He was settled abroad
for many years.

620
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,041
- Just returned a few days ago.
- Where were you?

621
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,708
Saudi Arabia.

622
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,541
I was there for a long time.

623
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,083
Where did you live?

624
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,458
Jeddah.

625
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,875
I see.
I was in Riyadh.

626
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:16,916
I'm Rahim.
And you?

627
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,708
Have some more sweets.

628
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,166
Why don't you freshen up inside?

629
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,750
Please come.

630
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:25,916
Here.

631
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,250
Have a seat.

632
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,541
I'll send Nadia.

633
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:49,541
Hey.

634
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,625
Are you Rafeez?

635
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,000
Come here.
I'm your uncle.

636
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:55,833
I've got chocolates for you.

637
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,000
You said he wouldn't come.

638
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,791
Why the hell is he here?

639
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,875
I have guests over.

640
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,458
I can't even introduce him
to anyone.

641
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,708
I have to lie over and over.

642
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:20,125
Now you want them all
in the same place.

643
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:25,875
If they find out who he is,
I will be out of a job.

644
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:29,125
- Can't my brother meet me?
- Why not?

645
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,208
But go to your house.

646
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,375
He's just here with bag and baggage.

647
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:39,041
He's here to see me.

648
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:40,333
Nadia.

649
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,000
Don't cross your limits.

650
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:46,250
Don't ruin our family for him.

651
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,083
What's wrong with you?

652
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:51,416
Why would it ruin my family?

653
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,458
It will!

654
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:55,375
I don't want any nuisance.

655
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,125
Hope I made myself clear.

656
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,250
Brother!

657
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,583
Everything is beautiful in this world!

658
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,416
The light and the air.

659
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,750
The trees and leaves.

660
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,250
Dad.

661
00:48:15,416 --> 00:48:17,000
Nishan, you're here.

662
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,833
This is my son, Nishan.

663
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:21,791
Nishan.

664
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,625
This is Feroz.

665
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,875
My former colleague.
We retired together.

666
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,083
He lives in Ukilpara.

667
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,041
- Sit.
- Hello.

668
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,416
Come on.

669
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:36,125
And this is Likhon.

670
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
She's Feroz's niece.

671
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,833
She lives in Rajshahi.

672
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:43,041
Her dad runs a silk business.

673
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,583
And this is Likhon's friend.

674
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,250
I see.

675
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,708
Feroz wants you and Likhon
to get married.

676
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,416
You'll have to move to Rajshahi
after marriage.

677
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,583
You'll have to look after
their business.

678
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,916
I think it's a good proposal.

679
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,625
You'll have a family.

680
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,583
You'll find a purpose in life.

681
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,333
The rest is up to you.

682
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,416
Listen.

683
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,458
I think they should talk in private.

684
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,666
Let's go outside.

685
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,958
Right, let's leave them to it.

686
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:21,291
Let's go. Come on.

687
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:32,958
"Sit here."

688
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,916
"Sit face to face."

689
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,875
- "Say something."
- What do I say?

690
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,500
"Anything.
Ask her something."

691
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,541
Will you still interpret for her
after we get married?

692
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:09,875
Why would I?

693
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,666
You'll learn sign language.

694
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:15,041
I thought "buy one get one free".
Package deal.

695
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,041
Hello, Babu.

696
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,166
Really?

697
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,291
Okay, I'll be right there.

698
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,000
Yes, I'm on my way.

699
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,375
Bye.

700
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,708
Sorry, I'll have to leave.

701
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,708
I think you don't know something.

702
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,458
I should let you know.

703
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,083
I got out of jail
a few days ago.

704
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,583
I was in for murder.

705
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,541
Got a 14-year sentence.

706
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,791
Not death penalty.

707
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,666
Everyone knows about it.

708
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,625
Maybe your uncle does too
but he didn't tell you.

709
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,750
I'm broken glass.

710
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:02,458
You'll end up getting hurt
if you're near me.

711
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,833
Bye.

712
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,833
And I don't want to
live off my in-laws.

713
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
This is Nishan.

714
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,958
Hello.

715
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:26,375
How are you?

716
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,958
Babu has recommended you
so there won't be any problem.

717
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:31,708
- Okay, Babu?
- Thank you.

718
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:40,750
Under the vast sky by the river

719
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:46,833
I look for the warmth of a home

720
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:53,791
Wandering through the lanes of memory

721
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:58,875
I find solace in its quiet embrace

722
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:04,000
I miss the good old days

723
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,666
The dreams that once touched me soft

724
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,625
Have now drifted away with the wind

725
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:16,625
Will you give me my world of dreams?

726
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:19,500
WILL WE TALK HERE
OR GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

727
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,666
FIVE MINUTES?

728
00:52:24,916 --> 00:52:29,750
Will you give me my world of dreams?

729
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:38,666
Will our love story
have a new beginning?

730
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,875
UNCLE TOLD ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU

731
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,666
I LIKE YOU

732
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,166
I LIKE YOUR HONESTY

733
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,416
AND YOU'RE SO BLOODY HANDSOME

734
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,666
AND YOU'RE SO BLOODY HANDSOME

735
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:15,708
I'M SCARED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE
A DEAF-MUTE LIKE ME

736
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,416
I WAS MARRIED BEFORE

737
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,916
MY HUSBAND TOOK ALL THE MONEY
AND ELOPED ABROAD WITH MY COUSIN

738
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:40,333
WE'RE BOTH BIRDS WITH BROKEN WINGS

739
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,333
DEFEATED IN LIFE'S BATTLE

740
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:52,541
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PLANS FOR MURDER

741
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,000
WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR EVENINGS
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS?

742
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,625
I'M NOT AFRAID OF BROKEN GLASS

743
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,333
I'll let you know.

744
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:19,875
I look for a light in the darkness

745
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:25,166
Will you give me my world of dreams?

746
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:35,250
Will our love story
have a new beginning?

747
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:42,375
We're the only friends you have.

748
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:48,333
Will our love story
have a new beginning?

749
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,833
WILL YOU DROP ME HOME?

750
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,416
Brother.

751
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,333
Please come over tomorrow.

752
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,208
I've spoken to Russel.

753
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:57,541
Come over once.

754
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:59,500
We'll sort it out.

755
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,000
Please, Brother.

756
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,500
Okay, sure.

757
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,166
I'll be there.

758
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,291
Bye.

759
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:07,416
Bye.

760
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:20,833
Nishan.

761
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:22,291
Hang on.

762
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,375
Here, take your lunchbox.

763
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:27,791
- Thanks.
- Bye.

764
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,500
Bye, Dad.

765
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:45,000
"You've forgotten me.

766
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,166
But I haven't.

767
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:52,458
Let's reminisce some moments
from the past.

768
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,458
You know everything
I've been through.

769
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:58,625
I know.

770
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,041
You're doing a job.

771
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:04,291
You're living a simple, ordinary life.

772
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,666
I know everything.
But...

773
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,708
The world is very cruel, Nishan.

774
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,250
No, boss.

775
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:12,958
Everything is alright.

776
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:14,916
Everything.

777
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,958
I'm very happy.

778
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,916
Really happy.

779
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,208
This is the life I want.

780
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:25,291
Look, boss.

781
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,500
You helped me a lot
when I was in jail.

782
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:35,250
I'll always be grateful to you...

783
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,750
But I...

784
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,375
don't want to get back to that work.

785
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,500
Okay.

786
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,333
Bless you.

787
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:47,125
Thanks.

788
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:48,958
Bye.

789
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,166
Boss.

790
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,458
Should we use Nishan?

791
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,083
No.

792
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:07,166
Let him be.

793
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:15,958
Make sure you clear them all today.

794
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,291
Nishan.

795
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:18,916
Come here.

796
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,208
I'll keep this.

797
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:21,833
No need.
Come here.

798
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,625
Get to work.

799
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,250
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

800
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,416
You don't have to come anymore.

801
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,000
What...

802
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,541
I mean... Why...

803
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,083
What did I do?

804
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,208
You didn't do anything.

805
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:47,958
Don't you know?

806
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:50,291
Don't you check social media?

807
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,833
Social media...

808
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:01,000
They let that criminal out?

809
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:03,833
My dear son is lying in the grave.

810
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,125
And his killer will live happily?

811
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,916
He should've been hanged.
I want him to be hanged.

812
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,791
Everyone's trending
#BoycottShilpiStore.

813
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,166
I'll have to shut up shop
if the video goes viral.

814
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:19,958
I'm sorry.

815
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,125
No...

816
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,000
Bye.

817
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,416
Take care.

818
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,041
No!
Get lost!

819
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:41,500
Go away!

820
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,291
Excuse me.
You're Nishan, aren't you?

821
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:54,250
You look like a normal person.

822
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,666
Why are you here, bugger?

823
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,125
Want to kill me?

824
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:16,583
- Killing my son wasn't enough?
- Ma'am, please...

825
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:17,833
I'll kill you!

826
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,500
- I'll kill you!
- Please forgive me.

827
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:23,083
How dare you come here again?

828
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:25,250
What the hell are you doing here?

829
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:28,416
- Please leave.
- I'm going to kill you!

830
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,875
- You bloody scoundrel!
- Please forgive me!

831
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:32,708
- Please go!
- You're dead!

832
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:35,250
- Get lost!
- Please leave.

833
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,708
- Go!
- He killed my son!

834
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:40,625
- Please go.
- Leave!

835
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,541
- It's okay. Calm down.
- He killed my boy...

836
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:50,041
Everything is beautiful
in Allah's world...

837
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,791
- Hello.
- Hello.

838
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:41,916
- Where's Nadia?
- Who are you?

839
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,250
I'm her brother.
She called me over.

840
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,416
And you just came?

841
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,375
Don't you have any sense?

842
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,875
They're a family.

843
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:52,083
But they're fighting over you.

844
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,666
Jashim, go inside.

845
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:00,208
I called you to say
you don't have to come.

846
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:01,833
Who is he?

847
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:04,291
Russel's cousin brother.

848
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,083
Hey.

849
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,541
- What's this?
- It's nothing.

850
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:14,708
- Show me.
- Not...

851
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,291
Did he hit you?

852
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,833
Is it because of me?

853
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,291
It's common in married couples.

854
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,416
Hey, Russel.

855
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,041
How could you hit my sister?

856
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:31,416
My parents raised her
with a lot of care.

857
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,208
We've never raised a hand on her.
How could you?

858
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,875
- Hey, it's all your fault.
- Hey!

859
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,333
- Hey! Hey!
- Brother!

860
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:40,500
- I'll kill you!
- Let him go!

861
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:43,458
Brother, no...
Please...

862
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,208
I'm sorry.

863
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,208
Sorry.

864
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:50,000
I won't come here again.

865
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,458
I'll never come here.

866
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,125
Everything is beautiful
in Allah's world.

867
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:04,333
The trees and the leaves.
The sky...

868
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:06,416
The air and water...

869
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:07,541
Nishan!

870
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,375
You'll rot in hell!

871
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:11,666
Bloody monster!

872
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,333
Everything is beautiful
in this world.

873
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,625
- Nishan must be hanged!
- Hang him now!

874
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:21,708
- Our brother's blood!
- Won't go to waste!

875
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:24,833
- Our brother's blood!
- Won't be spilled in vain!

876
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:28,375
- Our brother's blood!
- Won't go to waste!

877
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,750
- Nishan must be hanged!
- We want him hanged!

878
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,416
- We want him hanged!
- Nishan must be hanged!

879
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,708
- Our brother's blood!
- Won't go to waste!

880
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:41,916
- Our brother's blood!
- Won't be spilled in vain!

881
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,875
Nishan must be hanged!

882
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,750
Nishan must be hanged--

883
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:09,458
What else is left?

884
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,291
What else will you do?

885
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:13,333
Why did you go to Sohag's house?

886
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,041
Why?

887
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:16,625
What do you want?

888
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:19,416
You want them to set us on fire?

889
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,458
Rahim.
Excuse me.

890
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:25,916
Please.

891
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,916
Why did you go there?

892
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:36,125
I went to apologise.

893
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,291
You killed her son.

894
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:41,500
And you want her to forgive you?

895
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,375
Then what should I do?

896
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,166
Should I kill myself?

897
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:47,041
Tell me.

898
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:49,125
Should I hang myself?

899
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,041
Tell me what I should do.

900
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:53,916
People think you were there
to threaten her.

901
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:57,875
You wanted revenge from her
for sending you to jail.

902
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,625
That murderer went
to Sohag's house.

903
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:03,416
Threatened his mom
because she got him arrested.

904
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,583
We want revenge!
We want justice!

905
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,625
I will leave this place.

906
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:22,375
When?

907
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:25,791
Whenever you say.

908
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:28,333
The sooner the better.

909
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:30,041
Okay.

910
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:32,250
I know what happened...

911
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,500
so I'm not filing the case.

912
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:36,916
One more thing.

913
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:43,333
Don't step out of the house
until you leave.

914
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,583
- Let's go.
- Come on.

915
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,541
Problem solved.

916
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,625
Forgive me, Dad.

917
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:19,083
You never look me in the eye.

918
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,250
Because it reminds you...

919
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:31,583
that your mom died because of me.

920
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,500
Forgive me.

921
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,541
Please don't hate me.

922
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:02,750
Did you really go there to apologise?

923
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:04,833
Yes.

924
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,250
It takes courage to apologise.

925
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:14,208
Even the mighty have fallen
because they didn't apologise.

926
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,291
Go to Rajshashi.

927
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:22,291
Get married to Likhon.

928
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,083
Find a purpose in life.

929
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,958
You'll be at peace.

930
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:35,000
My biggest mistake in life was...

931
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:38,125
not being strong
when I needed to be.

932
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:42,250
Your life would've been different
otherwise.

933
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:02,458
Uncle.

934
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,500
Excuse me, uncle.
Please move.

935
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:10,500
Smile!

936
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,083
Look here.

937
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,583
Dad said...

938
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,083
I'll be happy if I marry you.

939
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,833
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

940
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,666
No, it's a major reason but...

941
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,208
What's the matter, Kushali?

942
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,666
Yes, Nishan?

943
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,541
Does Zarine live in Rajshahi?

944
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:31,875
Zarine?

945
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:34,625
Zarine doesn't stay in Rajshahi.
Likhon lives there.

946
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,291
I just saw Zarine.

947
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:40,125
You're mistaken.
Zarine doesn't live in Rajshahi.

948
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:42,625
I'm very sure I saw Zarine.

949
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,333
There was a little girl with her.

950
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:45,625
I think it's her daughter.

951
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:48,875
Zarine doesn't live in Rajshahi.
You made a mistake.

952
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:51,083
How does it matter if she lives there?

953
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:52,708
You're there for Likhon.

954
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:54,291
Why are you thinking of Zarine?

955
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,666
Hang up.

956
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,125
"This is the guest room."

957
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:07,666
"Uncle is in Dhaka."

958
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:09,041
"He'll be back tomorrow."

959
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,791
"You can stay here
for the next few days."

960
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,958
You can move in after the wedding.

961
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,833
What the hell!
I didn't say anything wrong.

962
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:30,875
I have to go out.

963
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,208
"Should I come?"

964
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,083
No, I'll go alone.

965
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,583
"Okay."

966
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,458
A great girl...

967
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:54,250
A peaceful life...

968
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,000
...is awaiting you.

969
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:59,666
And you're chasing a mirage.
Why?

970
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,708
You're inviting trouble.

971
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:05,083
Please don't do this.

972
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:06,875
Forget Zarine.

973
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:26,541
Hey, stop!

974
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,291
Shoaib wants to see you.

975
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:32,625
Who's that?

976
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,166
He wants to see you.

977
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,375
Hey!

978
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:40,208
Don't you get it?

979
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,833
Come with us.

980
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,000
I'm in a bad mood today.

981
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,750
To hell with your mood.

982
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,875
Hey!

983
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,583
Why do you get in to fights
on the road?

984
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:12,250
Naughty boy!

985
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,333
He's a fresher.
A newcomer.

986
01:13:14,583 --> 01:13:16,333
You'll be in big trouble.

987
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:23,875
Shoaib works for me.

988
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:27,208
Saw you entering the shopping mall
so sent for you.

989
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:29,458
They could've told me about you.

990
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,916
Then there'd be no twist in the film.

991
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:37,625
Hey! Up, up, up!

992
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,375
Come up.

993
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,458
Bulletproof glass.
Can't risk rolling it down.

994
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,916
Where are we going?

995
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,083
My farmhouse.

996
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:47,791
We're almost there.

997
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:04,833
Whose car is this?

998
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,750
Mine.

999
01:14:10,416 --> 01:14:11,458
Come.

1000
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,208
Don't worry.

1001
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,625
I'm here.

1002
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,750
I know what everyone is up to.

1003
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,375
Don't worry.

1004
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,666
I'll handle it.

1005
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,125
Trust me.

1006
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,500
My daughter.

1007
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,375
Kushali.

1008
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,666
Where's Radid?

1009
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,291
He's gone out with Mom.

1010
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,500
What the hell!

1011
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,083
Ma'am said it's important.

1012
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,208
Don't worry.
Ashraf is with them.

1013
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:58,291
Damn her important work!

1014
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,708
Is Radid okay?

1015
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,458
I've told you so many times.

1016
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,791
Don't go out without the red car.

1017
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,125
Don't care about you.
Why have you taken my son?

1018
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,875
Say hello to your new uncle.

1019
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:15,416
Come here.

1020
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:16,791
Sit with me.

1021
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,583
Come on.
Come closer.

1022
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,000
I have some work.

1023
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,583
What work?

1024
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,458
More important than me?

1025
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:24,583
Come to me.

1026
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:26,500
Sit with me.

1027
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:30,041
- I have really important stuff to do.
- Come on!

1028
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:31,541
Look at her.

1029
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,458
Stepdaughter.

1030
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,375
Doesn't look like me at all.

1031
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,125
She looks more like you.

1032
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,500
Just joking.

1033
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,791
I'll make you pure again.

1034
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,125
Nishan.

1035
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,250
Dad!

1036
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,458
Dad!

1037
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:08,333
Dad.

1038
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:21,708
Nishan.

1039
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:22,833
Sit.

1040
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:24,708
Want to play the drums?

1041
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:28,250
I'll play it with you.

1042
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,166
My son.

1043
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,833
Look.

1044
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,250
Looks exactly like me.

1045
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,625
Smells like me too.

1046
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,958
Go and play.

1047
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,083
My son.

1048
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,125
My blood.

1049
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,583
You left me at the hospital.

1050
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,583
Then I was in prison for three years.

1051
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,541
After I got it,
I started my business.

1052
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:04,916
It's all legal.

1053
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,833
Nothing shady.
All white.

1054
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,625
I'm involved in politics now.

1055
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,000
Going to contest in the MP elections.

1056
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,250
Then, go on to become a minister.

1057
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:15,750
After that...

1058
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:18,000
the game will begin!

1059
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:22,666
You're going to work with me.

1060
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,416
I need people like you.

1061
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,625
I don't want to work
in the border area.

1062
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:29,291
You know nothing about the border.

1063
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:31,458
It's not just smuggling cows.

1064
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:33,750
There are more things to do.

1065
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:37,041
Networking, distribution,
accounting, security.

1066
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:38,458
Forget your worries.

1067
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,375
Stay here.

1068
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:42,625
You'll learn the ropes soon.

1069
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,041
Just be loyal.
That's all I need.

1070
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,000
I'll teach you the rest.

1071
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,291
You don't have to decide right now.

1072
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,583
Sleep over it.

1073
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,125
- Shoaib!
- Yes, boss?

1074
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:54,208
Drop him off.

1075
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:55,500
Come on.

1076
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,833
She looks more like you.

1077
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:15,583
Ranjit sends his regards.

1078
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:22,458
Why didn't you tell me
Zarine married Rabi?

1079
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,208
Ranjit asked me not to.

1080
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,250
He is very fond of you.

1081
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,625
So didn't want to cause any trouble.

1082
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:36,041
Nishan.

1083
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,208
Yes, Ranjit.

1084
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:40,166
You wanted to stay out
of the business.

1085
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,416
I didn't force you to stay.

1086
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,625
But...

1087
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:47,333
If you get back in the business
then it has to be with me.

1088
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:50,333
My Nishan will work with me.

1089
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,208
Not with some traitor.

1090
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:54,333
What say, Nishan?

1091
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,291
Yes, Ranjit.

1092
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:57,708
Anyway...

1093
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,250
Join that dumbf--k's gang.

1094
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:03,416
But share...

1095
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,166
...all his plans with me.

1096
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:11,166
The day Ranjit Singh loses it

1097
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,333
Traitor!

1098
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,125
he'll destroy Rabi's entire family.

1099
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:19,416
Keep this.

1100
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,833
I'm not meant to be a family man.

1101
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,791
Couldn't do it before.
Can't do it now.

1102
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,458
And if you marry me...

1103
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,833
people won't let you live in peace.

1104
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,458
This world is very cruel.

1105
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:08,416
They'll keep reminding you,
you married a murderer.

1106
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,625
I've found a job.

1107
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,708
Found some old friends.

1108
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:23,250
At the end of the tunnel...

1109
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,750
I've found some light.

1110
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,166
Please let me go.

1111
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,833
I have to leave.

1112
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:36,458
Or else all hell will break loose.

1113
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:38,791
- Bye.
- "No worries.

1114
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,041
It's your life, your decision.

1115
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,333
I'm perfectly okay with it.

1116
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:52,208
See, I'm smiling."

1117
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,458
Can I hug you?

1118
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,291
"Take care of yourself.

1119
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:18,541
Travel safe.

1120
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,125
I'll be waiting for you."

1121
01:21:24,333 --> 01:21:25,750
I have to go now.

1122
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:29,166
"I'll be waiting."

1123
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:30,791
Bye.

1124
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:48,833
"A hundred moons may shine.

1125
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:52,208
Yet none can match your light.

1126
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:58,125
For only in your presence..."

1127
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,333
"For only in your presence..."

1128
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:06,208
"...does the night feel bright.

1129
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:12,041
Such great wealth cannot
through charity be earned.

1130
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:18,166
Love is a fragrance
that lingers on forever.

1131
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:22,541
Even at his most lonesome...

1132
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:33,291
he is never alone."

1133
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,333
Want to say something?

1134
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:43,333
This is my wife, Zarine.

1135
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:48,125
I did a lot of contractual work
for her father.

1136
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,625
Earned a lot of money.

1137
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,083
A single mother.

1138
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:56,541
She couldn't find a husband.

1139
01:22:57,083 --> 01:23:01,041
All kinds of old geezers
were lining up.

1140
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:04,333
She was so gorgeous.
So sweet.

1141
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,583
Her father asked me
and I readily got married.

1142
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:12,291
Zarine, this is Nishan.

1143
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:15,166
He'll be working with me.

1144
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:17,250
He'll stay at the guest house.

1145
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:21,291
Want to say something?

1146
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,458
She doesn't say anything.

1147
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:28,333
Come on.
Continue.

1148
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:57,750
Bloody monster!
Murderer!

1149
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,708
Why have you come here?
What do you want?

1150
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:01,500
Answer me!

1151
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,750
How are you, Zarine?

1152
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:05,625
Nishan, please go away.

1153
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:08,375
You can't stay here.
Leave right now.

1154
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,375
Whose daughter is Kushali?

1155
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:13,500
She is my daughter.
Sohag's daughter.

1156
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:15,375
- Kushali is my daughter.
- No.

1157
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,916
She is Sohag's daughter.

1158
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:20,166
Don't lie.
She looks exactly like my grandma.

1159
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:22,208
My dad and grandma
were thick glasses too.

1160
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,666
- Sohag had glasses too.
- Thousands of people wear glasses.

1161
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:28,416
Are you sure she is Sohag's daughter?

1162
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,208
There it is.

1163
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,875
You have doubts.

1164
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:36,041
- I know she is Sohag's daughter.
- No, you don't.

1165
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,416
Kushali is my daughter.

1166
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,875
I can feel it in my heart.

1167
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,541
I'll tell Radid's father everything.

1168
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:45,000
Radid's father?

1169
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,625
I've lived with criminals for 14 years.

1170
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,208
Rabi knows everything.

1171
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,541
He brought me here
despite knowing it all.

1172
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,916
He is planning something big.

1173
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:02,000
I'll tell Kushali
how you killed her father.

1174
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,166
I didn't kill Sohag!

1175
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,083
It was an accident.

1176
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:08,791
I made a mistake.

1177
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,666
Please consider that, at least.

1178
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,750
I can still see it
like it happened yesterday.

1179
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:16,708
My life would have been so different.

1180
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,458
My daughter grew up
without a father.

1181
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,666
Her life would have been so different.

1182
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,875
And you're asking me to consider?

1183
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,666
I don't want to see you
ever again.

1184
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:29,500
If you don't leave,
I'll kill you.

1185
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:22,750
Sit.

1186
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:32,625
Did Ranjit call you?

1187
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:36,708
No.

1188
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,083
You'd last met him in India.

1189
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:41,833
Haven't you met him
or talked to him since?

1190
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,375
No.

1191
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:51,958
Ranjit Singh is a dangerous guy.

1192
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,916
He wants to control everything.

1193
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:01,458
He must have
the last word on everything.

1194
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:06,125
One has to partner up with him
in business and no one else.

1195
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,583
Strange rules!

1196
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,833
Junaid Khan.

1197
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,750
India's biggest gold smuggler.

1198
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,875
Picked up a consignment
from Junaid Khan.

1199
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:26,666
Ranjit has destroyed all the documents
and killed my men.

1200
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:33,000
A few days back, the cops
got hold of Ranjit's consignment.

1201
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,291
And he accused me
of informing the cops.

1202
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,041
Can you imagine?

1203
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:46,625
I offered to parlay with him.

1204
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:49,750
But he's insisting I pay him
the full amount of the lost cargo.

1205
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:55,208
I suggested we talk face to face.

1206
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,125
Let's resolve the matter.

1207
01:27:57,291 --> 01:28:00,500
He wants money first
then he'll talk.

1208
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,791
He's not even answering my calls.

1209
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,500
Nishan.

1210
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:09,500
Ranjit Singh is really fond of you.

1211
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:11,958
Put in a good word for me.

1212
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,000
What will I say?

1213
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:17,750
Tell him Rabi wants to
resolve the matter.

1214
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:19,833
In person.
Face to face.

1215
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:22,041
He won't listen to me.

1216
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,291
Ranjit is...

1217
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:26,708
only going to listen to money.

1218
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,583
Talk to him about money then.
No problem.

1219
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,625
It's a video call.
Talk to him.

1220
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:36,625
Hello.

1221
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:37,666
Who's this?

1222
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,208
Sir, this is Nishan.

1223
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:40,916
Rabi is here with me.

1224
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,958
Hey!

1225
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:44,416
What are you doing
with that scoundrel?

1226
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:45,541
Sir.

1227
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:47,208
He wants to discuss money.

1228
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:49,125
He will return what he owes you.

1229
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,416
Just talk to him for a minute.

1230
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,625
Hey, take it away.

1231
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:57,208
I just need to talk to you.

1232
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,416
Want to sit face to face
with you.

1233
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,291
And resolve the matter.

1234
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:02,583
Come.

1235
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:04,000
Come to India.

1236
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:04,916
Right.

1237
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:08,791
You want me to go to India
so that you can kill me?

1238
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:11,291
Do you want me to come
to Bangladesh?

1239
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:12,791
Why?
What will happen?

1240
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:15,000
Do I look like a scary ghost to you?

1241
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,708
I'm not going to hurt you.

1242
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:22,416
You pretty much
run the government here.

1243
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:26,791
You run the entire syndicate.
And they won't spare me.

1244
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:29,541
Just come to Bangladesh.

1245
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:32,916
I'll return all your money.
Just come and meet me.

1246
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:34,708
You'll return all the money?

1247
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:38,041
I'll pay you hard cash in dollars.

1248
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:40,166
Nishan is here, right?

1249
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,958
He'll keep you updated
about everything.

1250
01:29:45,291 --> 01:29:46,625
Sir, please.

1251
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:51,166
Please don't harm
my family and my kids.

1252
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,291
Okay.

1253
01:29:53,916 --> 01:29:55,375
I'll let you know.

1254
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:01,750
Keep the phone.

1255
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:04,208
If Ranjit calls...

1256
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:07,000
Let me know.
Okay?

1257
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,666
I need to talk to you.

1258
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:18,375
You know who Nishan is
and what he's done.

1259
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:21,583
You haven't told me anything.

1260
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:27,208
Will you still let him stay here?

1261
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:33,166
There's still a lot I don't know
that's why I'm keeping him here.

1262
01:30:33,708 --> 01:30:35,750
Is he Kushali's father?

1263
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,958
I don't know.
I must find out.

1264
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:42,708
I don't think even you know
who her father is.

1265
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:44,791
Do you know?

1266
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:49,708
Nishan is doing something important
for me.

1267
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:51,500
He'll stay here.

1268
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:54,750
Then I'll take the kids to the city.

1269
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,916
There's no security
in the city residence.

1270
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:01,250
If you want to go,
take Kushali with you.

1271
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,083
Radid will stay here.

1272
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:14,541
My kid's safety matters the most.

1273
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:17,833
You would've known
if you had a kid.

1274
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:19,541
It's tough to be a parent.

1275
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:22,791
Pass it to me.

1276
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,916
I'll slap you!

1277
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:31,375
Pass it to me.

1278
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,083
She fell again!

1279
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:42,625
Let's play.

1280
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,625
I'll help you.

1281
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:48,500
Look ahead while riding.

1282
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:01,791
Kushali!

1283
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,375
Come inside.

1284
01:32:04,791 --> 01:32:06,208
No need to learn to bike.

1285
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:07,791
Let her learn from him.

1286
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:09,250
What's the issue?

1287
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:10,625
It's okay.

1288
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:12,750
I'll teach you.
You'll learn in a jiffy.

1289
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:20,833
I'll teach you in a second.
Don't worry, my baby.

1290
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:22,791
Don't worry.

1291
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:26,833
Raise your leg.
Right here.

1292
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:29,416
Come on.
Get on.

1293
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:31,125
Don't worry.

1294
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:33,291
Come on, paddle.

1295
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,041
Right, paddle.

1296
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,958
You have to hold the bike
from behind to support.

1297
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:53,416
You don't have to touch her.

1298
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,041
Let it be.

1299
01:32:56,375 --> 01:32:58,375
I have to go.
I have classes.

1300
01:32:58,916 --> 01:33:00,875
Who's going to drop you off now?

1301
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:02,708
No one's around.

1302
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:04,166
Who will take you?

1303
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:05,625
He'll take me.

1304
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:08,500
It's too risky to go to the city now.
You can't go.

1305
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,916
There's no risk.

1306
01:33:10,291 --> 01:33:11,375
For him.

1307
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:13,291
He's Ranjit Singh's guy.

1308
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:15,333
Go ahead.

1309
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,500
Take her.

1310
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:31,375
I can take care of myself.

1311
01:33:35,416 --> 01:33:36,791
Is your name Nishan?

1312
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:40,875
Yes.

1313
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,958
What does it mean?

1314
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:45,041
A mark.

1315
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:48,375
A sign.

1316
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:50,250
Is that even a name?

1317
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,125
Mr. Sign.

1318
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:55,541
Do you live in Saidpur?

1319
01:33:56,916 --> 01:33:58,083
Yes.

1320
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:00,958
My grandparents used to live there too.

1321
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:02,541
But not anymore.

1322
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:04,166
They live in Dhaka now.

1323
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:12,666
My dad died before I was born.

1324
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:14,916
In an accident.

1325
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:18,583
I've never seen him.

1326
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:22,666
How dare you?

1327
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,416
Nishan!

1328
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,666
Wait, Mr. Sign.
That's my school.

1329
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,500
Stop here.

1330
01:34:40,916 --> 01:34:42,041
Wait here.

1331
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:06,500
My God!
Eight missed calls?

1332
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,833
This woman is crazy.

1333
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:12,125
Anyway.

1334
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,875
Are you on social media?

1335
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,291
No.

1336
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,875
It's nonsense.

1337
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:21,250
I deactivated my account too.

1338
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:24,125
We use a new app.

1339
01:35:26,416 --> 01:35:30,916
Do you know...

1340
01:35:32,916 --> 01:35:34,750
what Rabi does?

1341
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:36,625
Yes, he's in politics.

1342
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,750
The way he behaves with you...

1343
01:35:43,166 --> 01:35:45,041
Did you tell your mom about it?

1344
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,708
He will deny it.

1345
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,041
And call it my mistake.

1346
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:55,375
Then he'll fight with Mom.

1347
01:35:57,291 --> 01:35:59,416
Mom has already been through enough.

1348
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:01,375
I don't want more for her.

1349
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:05,708
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

1350
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,666
Promise me.

1351
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:12,583
I promise.

1352
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:21,958
Here, keep this.

1353
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:24,458
Blow it and I'll be there for you.

1354
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:35,666
I could've taken you to coaching class.

1355
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:38,166
No problem.
Mr. Sign is nice. I like him.

1356
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:01,750
The staff don't enter the house.

1357
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,041
It's out of bounds for them.

1358
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,500
I told you to leave, Nishan.

1359
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:13,541
I won't leave, Zarine.

1360
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:15,291
What?

1361
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,916
I won't go away.

1362
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,416
They threw me out of Saidpur.

1363
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,208
I didn't say anything.

1364
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,083
I left home.

1365
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,666
But I won't go from here.

1366
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:32,416
I don't care what you want.

1367
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:36,250
I'm taking Kushali away from you.

1368
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:38,666
She's always be your daughter.

1369
01:37:40,916 --> 01:37:46,833
I don't want her
to be known as a criminal’s daughter.

1370
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:48,625
I don't want that.

1371
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:52,500
I know society all too well.

1372
01:37:54,416 --> 01:37:55,916
It's very cruel.

1373
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:59,083
It never forgives you.

1374
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:01,541
Want to be forgiven just like that?

1375
01:38:02,166 --> 01:38:03,375
Is that so easy?

1376
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:08,583
Mom, I'm going out to play.

1377
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:14,208
I don't have anyone.

1378
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:24,625
I'm all alone.

1379
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:29,416
You...

1380
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:32,791
know everything.

1381
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:39,708
Dad always told me
to find a purpose in life.

1382
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:41,958
I didn't listen to him.

1383
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:46,000
Always thought it was nonsense.

1384
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,125
But now I know what he meant.

1385
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,208
I've finally found a purpose.

1386
01:38:57,083 --> 01:38:58,541
Please try to understand.

1387
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:07,750
I had a lot of hopes
when I came out of jail.

1388
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,541
Thought I would get back my old life.

1389
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:18,250
But society destroyed all my hopes.

1390
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:27,000
I've found a flicker in the dark.

1391
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,666
Don't take that away from me.

1392
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,291
Please have mercy on me.

1393
01:39:34,666 --> 01:39:35,791
Mr. Sign!

1394
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:38,500
Mr. Sign!

1395
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,250
There, she's calling me.

1396
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,083
She is so pretty.

1397
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:46,791
So smart.

1398
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:51,666
I'll keep her safe.
I'll protect her.

1399
01:39:58,208 --> 01:40:00,000
Kushali is my daughter, isn't she?

1400
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:41,666
Downloaded the tracker app.
You can track my location.

1401
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,375
- What is it?
- It's an app.

1402
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:50,000
What's an app?

1403
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:52,291
You don't know what's an app?

1404
01:40:52,416 --> 01:40:53,500
LOL!

1405
01:40:57,541 --> 01:41:00,208
You don't know what LOL stands for?

1406
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:05,375
LOL.
Laughing Out Loud.

1407
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:08,791
LOL.

1408
01:41:09,541 --> 01:41:11,208
Laugh Out Loud.

1409
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:13,791
No.
Laughing Out Loud.

1410
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:16,208
Laughing Out Loud.

1411
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:20,416
LMAO.
Laughing My A-- Off!

1412
01:41:20,666 --> 01:41:22,750
LMAO.

1413
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:04,166
No, Babu.

1414
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,291
She's my daughter.

1415
01:42:07,666 --> 01:42:09,666
I know it.
I can just feel it.

1416
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:11,541
She's my blood.

1417
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:12,625
Damn it!

1418
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:15,000
Now everything will change.

1419
01:42:15,375 --> 01:42:16,875
Nothing will change.

1420
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:19,125
She'll live with her mom.

1421
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:21,625
I'll just be around.

1422
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,583
She is my own.

1423
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:29,666
That's all that matters.

1424
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:31,791
I'm happy with this.

1425
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:34,750
I'm very happy.

1426
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:53,166
LOL.

1427
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:55,541
Laughing Out Loud.

1428
01:42:56,916 --> 01:42:58,250
Please!

1429
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:02,166
OMG!
Oh my god, you're so mad at me.

1430
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:05,291
BTW.
By the way, listen to me...

1431
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:15,541
Hello, Granny.

1432
01:43:16,166 --> 01:43:17,416
How are you?

1433
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:21,000
I've made a new friend.
Nishan.

1434
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:22,833
What?
Nishan?

1435
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:26,583
Kushali!

1436
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:28,875
Go inside.

1437
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,291
Come on.

1438
01:43:31,166 --> 01:43:32,500
Go inside, Radid.

1439
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,041
Okay, Mom.

1440
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,625
No poetry in my house.

1441
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:48,208
I'll only inform Nishan
where we'll have the meeting.

1442
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,250
Only two people.

1443
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,541
You and Nishan.

1444
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:54,750
Tuhin and me.

1445
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,916
Why didn't you come on the 15th?

1446
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:35,000
I waited for you all day.

1447
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:37,458
That day.

1448
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:39,750
The next day.

1449
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:42,375
The day after.

1450
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,208
And the day after...

1451
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:48,416
But you didn't come.

1452
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:52,625
Why didn't you come, Nishan?

1453
01:44:54,916 --> 01:44:59,041
I thought I'll earn some money
and then...

1454
01:44:59,291 --> 01:45:01,750
Did I ask you to bring money?

1455
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:05,875
I told you I'll manage everything.

1456
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:13,083
Still, you didn't come.

1457
01:45:13,791 --> 01:45:15,750
Why didn't you come?

1458
01:45:17,375 --> 01:45:18,500
Zarine.

1459
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:24,375
Why didn't you love me
the way I did?

1460
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:30,208
Why didn't you hold on to me?

1461
01:45:37,541 --> 01:45:41,583
You don't know how to love.

1462
01:45:42,083 --> 01:45:44,583
You don't know what love is.

1463
01:45:45,125 --> 01:45:46,666
Why don't you...

1464
01:45:47,958 --> 01:45:49,291
I know...

1465
01:45:50,625 --> 01:45:52,458
I know now.

1466
01:46:24,875 --> 01:46:26,083
Listen.

1467
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:29,125
Hope you don't have
any more work with Nishan.

1468
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:30,666
Why do you ask?

1469
01:46:30,916 --> 01:46:32,583
Nishan won't stay here anymore.

1470
01:46:34,875 --> 01:46:36,375
He'll have to leave.

1471
01:46:48,791 --> 01:46:50,125
Hello, Ranjit.

1472
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,250
Boss.

1473
01:47:20,125 --> 01:47:21,458
Why are they here?

1474
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,416
It's game over for Rabi today.

1475
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,000
Come on.

1476
01:47:27,375 --> 01:47:28,666
Kushali!

1477
01:47:29,916 --> 01:47:31,291
Kushali!

1478
01:47:32,375 --> 01:47:33,708
Kushali.

1479
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:36,708
- Granny!
- Where is he?

1480
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:38,166
Where's that murderer?

1481
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:40,291
- Who?
- Nishan.

1482
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:42,208
- He's nice.
- Nice?

1483
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:43,625
Kushali?

1484
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,666
Back with your old flame?

1485
01:47:45,708 --> 01:47:47,708
Is that why you brought him over?

1486
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,625
- Come inside, Mother.
- Let me go.

1487
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:51,666
Is that why
you didn't tell her anything?

1488
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:54,791
So that you can get back together?

1489
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:57,250
Rabi brought him over for his business.

1490
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,750
That's why you got married
to a criminal.

1491
01:48:00,333 --> 01:48:02,541
- It's do or die today.
- Mother...

1492
01:48:03,375 --> 01:48:04,500
Mother.

1493
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:06,875
- Keep quiet.
- Your dad didn't die in an accident.

1494
01:48:06,916 --> 01:48:08,666
Please don't tell her anything.

1495
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:09,791
Nishan killed him!

1496
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:11,000
Mother!

1497
01:48:11,291 --> 01:48:12,791
Ask your mom.

1498
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,750
Ask her.

1499
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:18,250
My dear son...

1500
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:22,041
They killed him.

1501
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:28,000
They killed him...

1502
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:34,791
They killed my Sohag...

1503
01:48:35,291 --> 01:48:36,750
Kushali?

1504
01:48:38,166 --> 01:48:39,083
Kushali!

1505
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,625
Nishan!

1506
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:10,166
Ranjit.

1507
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:15,000
Boss.

1508
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,666
Greetings.

1509
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:18,125
I love you.

1510
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:35,583
Got the location?

1511
01:49:47,666 --> 01:49:49,416
I'll send you the exact location.

1512
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:12,666
Hello, Deputy Inspector General.

1513
01:50:12,875 --> 01:50:14,625
There's been a disaster!

1514
01:50:14,833 --> 01:50:18,875
Nishan shot Ranjit Singh
and ran away with the money.

1515
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,666
Talk to you later.
Don't worry.

1516
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:27,208
Peekaboo!

1517
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:28,916
Nishan!

1518
01:50:29,708 --> 01:50:31,083
Where are you?

1519
01:50:35,666 --> 01:50:37,000
What did you think?

1520
01:50:37,291 --> 01:50:39,916
I bumped into you by chance?

1521
01:50:40,208 --> 01:50:42,208
It was all just a coincidence?

1522
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,208
You came to Rajshahi by choice?

1523
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,708
I made sure you ended up here.

1524
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:50,875
I f--king planned it all.

1525
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,791
Used a thorn to remove another.

1526
01:50:53,375 --> 01:50:54,458
Nishan.

1527
01:50:55,125 --> 01:50:56,208
Where are you?

1528
01:50:56,333 --> 01:50:57,333
Nishan.

1529
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:00,083
Time to settle our scores.

1530
01:51:00,375 --> 01:51:02,541
Let's settle our scores.
Come out.

1531
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:02,000
I told you
I'd shoot Ranjit Singh first.

1532
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:03,875
But you wanted to kill him.

1533
01:52:04,166 --> 01:52:07,041
I took the shot.
I'm sure I got him.

1534
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:09,875
- We didn't find the dead body.
- We will soon.

1535
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:11,750
Don't worry.

1536
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,583
Khan is calling.

1537
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:16,250
Khan.

1538
01:52:16,791 --> 01:52:19,041
Nishan blew it.

1539
01:52:19,333 --> 01:52:20,708
He blew it.

1540
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:22,500
He f--king screwed us.

1541
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:25,208
The underground business
has its rules.

1542
01:52:25,333 --> 01:52:27,208
You shouldn't have broken them.

1543
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:30,166
You messed up the system
by killing Ranjit.

1544
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:32,125
You'll pay for it.

1545
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:35,250
No, no, no.
I didn't do anything.

1546
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:36,458
Hello--

1547
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:37,416
Bloody hell!

1548
01:52:37,666 --> 01:52:39,291
How did he find out from India?

1549
01:52:39,541 --> 01:52:41,166
Who leaked the news?

1550
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,541
It's the f--king DIG now.

1551
01:52:46,041 --> 01:52:47,625
What the hell did you do?

1552
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:49,250
Why did you kill Ranjit Singh?

1553
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,333
Nishan did--

1554
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:51,541
Shut up, scoundrel!

1555
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,416
You think I'm a f--king fool?

1556
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:55,291
It's gone up to the authorities.

1557
01:52:55,458 --> 01:52:56,875
I'm in trouble now.

1558
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,333
Please listen to me--

1559
01:52:58,416 --> 01:52:59,541
You're finished!

1560
01:52:59,791 --> 01:53:00,958
You're a goner.

1561
01:53:01,375 --> 01:53:02,708
F--king s--t!

1562
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:04,625
Radid!

1563
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:07,041
Hey, why are you here?

1564
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:09,041
I'm here to meet my granddaughter.

1565
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:10,541
Bloody hag!

1566
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:11,583
Zarine!

1567
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:12,625
Zarine!

1568
01:53:12,916 --> 01:53:15,666
Ma'am has gone out with Radid
to look for Kushali.

1569
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:17,375
Bloody b---h!

1570
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,000
You all killed my son.

1571
01:53:19,166 --> 01:53:22,125
Now you're after my granddaughter.

1572
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:23,625
I'll kill you too.

1573
01:53:23,916 --> 01:53:26,166
- Wait and watch!
- Go ahead.

1574
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:28,458
I'll kill you.
You're so dead.

1575
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:30,375
Kill me.
Kill me.

1576
01:53:30,666 --> 01:53:31,750
Come on.

1577
01:53:32,041 --> 01:53:35,291
I anyway died the day my son died.

1578
01:53:35,791 --> 01:53:38,291
- Kill me!
- Take her away!

1579
01:53:41,333 --> 01:53:43,208
Why aren't you answering my calls?

1580
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,166
I put it my phone on silent.

1581
01:53:45,416 --> 01:53:47,250
I don't want to go back home.

1582
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:51,875
Kushali!

1583
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:53,833
Move it.

1584
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:54,875
Kushali!

1585
01:53:55,083 --> 01:53:56,208
Hurry up.

1586
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:58,833
Kushali!

1587
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:00,583
Kushali!

1588
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:09,666
Kushali, wait!

1589
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:30,791
Let me go!

1590
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:06,041
Where are you?

1591
01:55:06,208 --> 01:55:07,666
I don't want to know.

1592
01:55:07,916 --> 01:55:11,166
Get home with Radid in two minutes.

1593
01:55:44,375 --> 01:55:47,375
Ranjit Singh is still alive.

1594
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:49,833
You wanted to do business with Khan...

1595
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:53,916
...so you betrayed me.

1596
01:55:54,916 --> 01:55:58,791
Now I'll teach you how to kill people.

1597
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:02,958
I have got your daughter.

1598
01:56:03,666 --> 01:56:07,500
I'll destroy your family.

1599
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:32,666
Boss.

1600
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,375
Give back Ranjit's money!

1601
01:56:34,791 --> 01:56:36,041
What?

1602
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:41,416
Damn it!

1603
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,166
F--king hell!

1604
01:56:44,958 --> 01:56:46,125
Bloody swine!

1605
01:56:46,416 --> 01:56:47,875
F--king traitor!

1606
01:56:51,916 --> 01:56:53,041
Sir.

1607
01:56:53,291 --> 01:56:55,291
For God's sake, save me.

1608
01:56:55,625 --> 01:56:58,750
You have six hours
to leave the country.

1609
01:56:59,291 --> 01:57:01,916
I better not see you or Ranjit
here again.

1610
01:57:02,166 --> 01:57:03,250
Alhamdulillah!

1611
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:05,958
- Thank you, sir--
- Kushali!

1612
01:57:06,291 --> 01:57:07,791
Where is Kushali?

1613
01:57:08,375 --> 01:57:09,416
- Bloody whore!
- Mom!

1614
01:57:09,666 --> 01:57:10,833
F--king b---h!

1615
01:57:11,125 --> 01:57:14,166
It took you half an hour
to come home?

1616
01:57:14,333 --> 01:57:16,625
Come, Radid.
We'll leave.

1617
01:57:16,708 --> 01:57:19,666
- Where are you going?
- It's not safe here.

1618
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:21,708
They'll kill us any moment.

1619
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,291
I'm running away with Radid.

1620
01:57:23,541 --> 01:57:25,875
- Will you come?
- I can't leave Kushali behind.

1621
01:57:26,083 --> 01:57:27,291
Then die, b---h!

1622
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,875
- Don't take my son away.
- Let go of my son!

1623
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:32,666
- How dare you stop me?
- I won't let you--

1624
01:57:32,916 --> 01:57:34,166
Mom!

1625
01:58:05,291 --> 01:58:07,166
Give back Ranjit's money!

1626
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:11,583
Dad!

1627
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,125
- Come on, give it to me.
- Nishan!

1628
01:58:20,375 --> 01:58:21,625
- Nishan!
- Dad!

1629
01:58:22,125 --> 01:58:24,000
- I want the money!
- Nishan!

1630
01:58:24,166 --> 01:58:26,208
To hell with Nishan!

1631
01:58:26,416 --> 01:58:27,750
Ranjit has kidnapped Kushali!

1632
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:32,541
He'll Kushali
if he doesn't get his money back.

1633
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:34,916
Give back the money!

1634
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:35,791
Dad!

1635
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:38,083
Don't kill my dad.

1636
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:40,458
Please don't kill...

1637
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,916
Radid.

1638
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:49,666
I'm fine.

1639
01:58:50,250 --> 01:58:51,416
My son.

1640
01:58:51,916 --> 01:58:52,708
Mine.

1641
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,208
Your daughter is everything to you.

1642
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:59,291
My son is everything to me too.

1643
01:58:59,666 --> 01:59:01,791
My own blood.

1644
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:06,958
Ranjit asked me to...

1645
01:59:07,083 --> 01:59:09,291
go to Bilonia Station
with the money.

1646
01:59:10,125 --> 01:59:12,416
That scoundrel runs the place.

1647
01:59:12,666 --> 01:59:15,583
He'll kill my whole family
if I go there.

1648
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:19,166
I'll give you all the money.

1649
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:21,583
I promise, Nishan.

1650
01:59:22,416 --> 01:59:24,666
Just let me save my son.

1651
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:28,041
I've lost everything anyway.

1652
01:59:29,416 --> 01:59:31,666
Please let me save my son.

1653
01:59:32,166 --> 01:59:34,333
My son, my son...

1654
01:59:35,416 --> 01:59:36,750
Please...

1655
01:59:38,375 --> 01:59:40,458
Forgive me, Nishan.

1656
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:43,416
Please forgive me for his sake, Nishan.

1657
01:59:43,666 --> 01:59:46,458
Forgive me...
Please forgive me...

1658
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:47,791
Dad!

1659
01:59:57,916 --> 02:00:01,541
I've begged for forgiveness all my life.

1660
02:00:02,208 --> 02:00:03,833
But I've never been forgiven.

1661
02:00:04,416 --> 02:00:08,041
I forgive you for your son's sake.

1662
02:00:08,666 --> 02:00:10,166
I forgive you, Rabi.

1663
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:48,166
Let's go.

1664
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
You here?

1665
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:51,583
I'm going with you.

1666
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:53,666
I won't change my mind.

1667
02:00:54,416 --> 02:00:55,916
We only have a few hours.

1668
02:00:56,166 --> 02:00:59,666
We won't be able to get her back
if they cross the border.

1669
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:02,416
Take me to my granddaughter.

1670
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,416
- Kushali is not your--
- Nishan.

1671
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:10,708
Fine!

1672
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:31,541
Nishan.

1673
02:01:42,541 --> 02:01:44,000
What did he say?

1674
02:01:45,125 --> 02:01:46,750
He gave me the phone.

1675
02:01:53,208 --> 02:01:54,375
Nishan.

1676
02:01:54,583 --> 02:01:55,708
Ranjit.

1677
02:01:55,916 --> 02:01:57,375
I'll give back your money.

1678
02:01:57,708 --> 02:02:01,791
I trusted you, Nishan.

1679
02:02:02,125 --> 02:02:03,500
I didn't betray you.

1680
02:02:03,791 --> 02:02:06,125
Rabi planned to kill you.

1681
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,791
And pin the blame on me.

1682
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:11,541
But I didn't betray you.
Someone else did.

1683
02:02:12,458 --> 02:02:13,833
Send Rabi with the money.

1684
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:16,166
I'll let his daughter go.

1685
02:02:16,541 --> 02:02:18,291
Rabi won't come.

1686
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:20,125
Kushali is not his daughter.

1687
02:02:20,791 --> 02:02:22,083
She is my daughter.

1688
02:02:22,375 --> 02:02:23,666
I'm her father.

1689
02:02:24,666 --> 02:02:26,166
And Zarine is her mother.

1690
02:02:26,416 --> 02:02:28,875
She is my ex girlfriend,
the engineer's daughter.

1691
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:30,666
Oh! I see.

1692
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,416
I know about Zarine.

1693
02:02:34,958 --> 02:02:37,833
But is she really your daughter?

1694
02:02:38,041 --> 02:02:39,041
Mom!

1695
02:02:39,625 --> 02:02:40,666
Mom, don't come!

1696
02:02:41,291 --> 02:02:43,541
He won't keep his word.
Don't come!

1697
02:02:44,625 --> 02:02:47,708
Of course, she is your daughter.

1698
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:49,625
Ranjit.

1699
02:02:50,375 --> 02:02:52,291
I'll get your money.

1700
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:55,250
Tell me the place.

1701
02:02:56,125 --> 02:03:00,000
Cross the railway line.

1702
02:03:00,666 --> 02:03:02,416
Close to the border...

1703
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,416
there's a village called Matikata.

1704
02:03:08,291 --> 02:03:11,958
Come to Majumdar's house there.

1705
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:16,166
Meet me with the money.

1706
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:19,375
But Nishan...

1707
02:03:20,041 --> 02:03:23,041
I never forgive traitors.

1708
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:25,291
Bring my money.

1709
02:03:26,333 --> 02:03:27,958
I'll let your daughter go.

1710
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:30,666
But I won't let you go.

1711
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:33,291
Tuhin is dead because of you.

1712
02:03:33,791 --> 02:03:35,166
Blood for blood.

1713
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:37,958
Come alone.
Alone!

1714
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:41,416
Okay, done.

1715
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:16,791
I've finally found the purpose
in my life.

1716
02:04:19,458 --> 02:04:21,166
I'm not hurt at all.

1717
02:04:21,958 --> 02:04:23,375
I'm rather relieved.

1718
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:27,791
I feel like...

1719
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,250
I'm leaving a piece of me behind.

1720
02:04:34,166 --> 02:04:35,625
A part of my soul.

1721
02:04:35,916 --> 02:04:37,250
A sign.

1722
02:04:38,125 --> 02:04:39,375
Mr. Sign.

1723
02:04:41,083 --> 02:04:42,250
Zarine.

1724
02:04:43,458 --> 02:04:46,208
Raise Kushali with a lot of care.

1725
02:04:47,166 --> 02:04:49,041
I know she'll become a scientist.

1726
02:04:57,041 --> 02:04:58,375
Don't tell her about me.

1727
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:02,750
- Tell her--
- Kushali is not your daughter.

1728
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:05,041
She's not your daughter, Nishan.

1729
02:05:08,083 --> 02:05:10,583
How many times
will you say the same thing?

1730
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:12,458
I'm not lying.

1731
02:05:13,666 --> 02:05:15,916
Remember I took a strand of your hair.

1732
02:05:16,625 --> 02:05:19,583
I had a DNA test done.
Got the report.

1733
02:05:20,166 --> 02:05:22,083
You're not his father.

1734
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:27,416
Here, take a look.

1735
02:05:31,291 --> 02:05:33,291
Even I thought she's your daughter.

1736
02:05:37,125 --> 02:05:38,750
That's why I got the test done.

1737
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,375
Zarine...

1738
02:05:56,458 --> 02:05:58,125
a DNA report...

1739
02:05:59,375 --> 02:06:00,500
can be wrong.

1740
02:06:00,875 --> 02:06:02,500
But this is not wrong.

1741
02:06:03,791 --> 02:06:06,791
Her DNA matches with her grandmother's.
Not yours.

1742
02:06:07,625 --> 02:06:09,500
Don't sacrifice your life for her.

1743
02:06:11,125 --> 02:06:12,541
Start afresh.

1744
02:06:12,916 --> 02:06:14,166
Live your life.

1745
02:06:14,541 --> 02:06:16,041
I'll take the money.

1746
02:06:16,625 --> 02:06:18,458
I'll plead with them.

1747
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,041
They might let her go--

1748
02:06:58,666 --> 02:06:59,750
Bloody monster!

1749
02:07:00,291 --> 02:07:01,375
Sohag's mom.

1750
02:07:02,041 --> 02:07:03,083
Zarine.

1751
02:07:03,791 --> 02:07:04,875
My grandma.

1752
02:07:06,166 --> 02:07:11,708
Guilt feels like a heavy rock
sitting on your chest.

1753
02:07:29,416 --> 02:07:30,500
Nishan.

1754
02:07:32,041 --> 02:07:34,041
Dad, please forgive me.

1755
02:07:34,791 --> 02:07:35,916
Nishan.

1756
02:07:36,541 --> 02:07:39,041
I wanted to tell you but I couldn't.

1757
02:07:39,541 --> 02:07:41,291
I don't hate you, my son.

1758
02:07:41,875 --> 02:07:44,125
My mother forgave you.

1759
02:07:44,666 --> 02:07:46,000
Why wouldn't I?

1760
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:50,000
Mother kept thinking of you
until her last breath.

1761
02:07:50,291 --> 02:07:51,541
Hating you...

1762
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:54,875
would hurt her.

1763
02:07:56,166 --> 02:07:59,666
So I forgive you, my son.

1764
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:04,708
Don't be sad.

1765
02:08:05,333 --> 02:08:07,041
Don't be sad.

1766
02:08:07,916 --> 02:08:09,166
Goodbye, Dad.

1767
02:08:09,291 --> 02:08:10,625
Take care.

1768
02:08:16,166 --> 02:08:17,666
My daughter grew up without a father.

1769
02:08:17,833 --> 02:08:20,083
Her life would have been so different.

1770
02:08:20,791 --> 02:08:22,583
Is your name Nishan?

1771
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:25,000
What does it mean?

1772
02:08:26,041 --> 02:08:27,000
A mark.

1773
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:30,583
OMG!

1774
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:32,916
Oh my god,
you're so mad at me!

1775
02:09:40,041 --> 02:09:41,083
Ranjit!

1776
02:09:41,416 --> 02:09:42,916
I've got your money.

1777
02:09:44,041 --> 02:09:45,166
Let Kushali go.

1778
02:09:46,416 --> 02:09:47,750
Come out of hiding.

1779
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,791
Did you kill my dad?

1780
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:47,875
Yes.

1781
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:52,375
Your dad died because of you.

1782
02:10:54,125 --> 02:10:57,500
They said, "Your dad is coming".

1783
02:10:58,166 --> 02:10:59,333
Why?

1784
02:10:59,916 --> 02:11:01,166
Are you--

1785
02:11:03,166 --> 02:11:06,791
You know what's your real punishment?

1786
02:11:13,166 --> 02:11:14,875
Ranjit, you gave me your word.

1787
02:11:15,666 --> 02:11:21,583
She'll watch her father die

1788
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:24,416
right before her eyes.

1789
02:11:25,291 --> 02:11:28,416
That's your punishment.

1790
02:11:50,416 --> 02:11:51,375
Hey!

1791
02:11:51,625 --> 02:11:54,250
No firing close to the border, idiot.

1792
02:12:14,875 --> 02:12:17,208
- I won't kill you today.
- Nishan...

1793
02:12:17,916 --> 02:12:21,708
You'll regret all your life

1794
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,916
that you couldn't save your daughter.

1795
02:12:25,625 --> 02:12:28,791
Your daughter will end up
in some brothel in India.

1796
02:12:29,166 --> 02:12:32,583
And every day, a new jerk...

1797
02:12:32,916 --> 02:12:36,041
a monster will take his turn with her.

1798
02:12:37,875 --> 02:12:39,500
Nishan!
Nishan!

1799
02:12:40,541 --> 02:12:42,250
No, no, no...

1800
02:12:42,916 --> 02:12:45,500
Nishan...
Let me go.

1801
02:12:55,041 --> 02:12:56,000
Hurry up.

1802
02:12:59,833 --> 02:13:00,666
Move it.

1803
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:03,791
Split and move.
Come on.

1804
02:13:07,291 --> 02:13:08,416
Move it.

1805
02:13:09,416 --> 02:13:11,041
Keep quiet or I'll shoot you.

1806
02:13:12,291 --> 02:13:13,125
Walk!

1807
02:13:24,541 --> 02:13:26,291
Keep quiet.

1808
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:35,083
Nishan wants the Security Force
to take us out.

1809
02:13:35,541 --> 02:13:37,125
Keep quiet!

1810
02:13:37,375 --> 02:13:38,333
Quiet!

1811
02:15:11,166 --> 02:15:12,541
Mom!

1812
02:15:13,333 --> 02:15:15,208
- Kushali!
- Mom...

1813
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,750
My girl...

1814
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,208
My dear granddaughter...

1815
02:15:33,125 --> 02:15:34,208
Nishan!

1816
02:15:34,708 --> 02:15:36,250
- Nishan!
- Nishan.

1817
02:15:37,375 --> 02:15:39,041
- Nishan?
- Nishan.

1818
02:15:39,291 --> 02:15:40,916
Get up, Nishan.

1819
02:15:41,416 --> 02:15:43,666
We have to save him.
Get something.

1820
02:15:43,916 --> 02:15:45,833
- Hey, there's a cart.
- Come on.

1821
02:15:46,125 --> 02:15:47,625
Nishan, where does it hurt?

1822
02:15:53,416 --> 02:15:54,666
Nishan...

1823
02:15:55,708 --> 02:15:56,708
Zarine.

1824
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,625
I forgive you.

1825
02:15:59,625 --> 02:16:01,541
I forgive you, Nishan.

1826
02:16:03,666 --> 02:16:05,166
All my life...

1827
02:16:07,958 --> 02:16:09,958
I've tried to force my will on you.

1828
02:16:14,791 --> 02:16:16,333
I've only brought you pain.

1829
02:16:18,291 --> 02:16:20,250
Nothing but pain.

1830
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:29,000
Break it fast.

1831
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:31,000
He'll die. Quick!

1832
02:16:31,291 --> 02:16:33,166
We have to take him
to the hospital.

1833
02:16:33,916 --> 02:16:38,291
"When the heart hurts...

1834
02:16:41,125 --> 02:16:42,541
we seek a cure.

1835
02:16:45,625 --> 02:16:47,875
But what if..."

1836
02:16:49,375 --> 02:16:50,583
Nishan...

1837
02:16:50,875 --> 02:16:54,125
"But what if the heart
is the cause of pain?"

1838
02:16:57,666 --> 02:16:59,125
- Mom!
- Nishan...

1839
02:16:59,375 --> 02:17:01,541
Found a cart.
But no driver.

1840
02:17:01,791 --> 02:17:03,875
- You have to save him.
- Help him up.

1841
02:17:04,083 --> 02:17:05,333
Come on.

1842
02:17:06,291 --> 02:17:08,958
We'll have to get medical help.

1843
02:17:09,291 --> 02:17:10,708
Be careful.

1844
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:23,791
Everything is beautiful
in Allah's world.

1845
02:17:24,416 --> 02:17:27,250
Everything is magical
in Allah's world.

1846
02:17:27,666 --> 02:17:29,666
The air, the water, the light...

1847
02:17:31,041 --> 02:17:32,958
The air, the water, the light...

1848
02:17:40,916 --> 02:17:41,916
Kushali!

1849
02:17:42,166 --> 02:17:43,791
Nishan! No, no, no.

1850
02:17:43,916 --> 02:17:45,333
Nishan.

1851
02:17:46,166 --> 02:17:48,666
Nishan, please no...

1852
02:17:48,916 --> 02:17:50,208
Nishan...

1853
02:18:07,416 --> 02:18:10,291
She's stubborn just like me.

1854
02:18:26,916 --> 02:18:30,041
- Nishan!
- Nishan!

1855
02:18:30,416 --> 02:18:33,375
- Nishan!
- Nishan!

1856
02:18:33,666 --> 02:18:36,833
- Nishan!
- Nishan!

1857
02:18:37,666 --> 02:18:40,250
- Nishan!
- Nishan!

1858
02:18:40,833 --> 02:18:42,958
- Nishan!
- Nishan!

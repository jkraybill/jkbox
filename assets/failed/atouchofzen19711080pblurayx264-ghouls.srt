Just humble efforts

23
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,388
It's excellent

24
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,141
May I do a portrait for you?

25
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,896
All right

26
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,523
Please take a seat

27
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,368
May I know your name?

00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,203
Ouyang Nian

29
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,829
Mr. Ouyang

30
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,171
You must have had a tiring journey

31
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,131
How do you know?

32
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:13,095
I know almost everyone in this remote town

33
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,390
I've just arrived

34
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,600
You've lived here all your life?

35
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,060
Yes

36
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,105
Ah... your hat?

37
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,460
And turn your head to the side

38
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,241
What's your name?

39
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,659
Gu Shengzhai.

40
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,785
Good morning!

41
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,038
Shengzhai!

42
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,624
You're early today

43
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,377
Can I offer you some tea?

44
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,296
Not now, you're busy. I'll come by later

45
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:30,631
See you

46
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,259
<i>Mr. Gu...</i>

47
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,888
- Who is he?
- They sell medicinal herbs

48
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,641
- What's his name?
- Lu. Why do you ask?

49
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,851
Is he local?

50
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,686
No, they came about a month ago

51
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,854
He's quite skilled

52
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,689
He has a stall near the temple

53
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,982
Why do you ask?

54
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,275
No reason

55
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,037
Mr. Ouyang...

56
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,747
I'll be back tomorrow

57
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,705
Mind the step!

58
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,837
Mother!

59
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,880
Mr. Shi

60
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,256
You're back early, Mr. Gu

61
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,550
- Won't you stay a while?
- Another time

62
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:44,968
See you then

63
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,553
- Bye
- Goodbye

64
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,015
Mother, has someone moved in?

65
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,392
Who'd dare to live there?

66
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,820
Mr. Shi just told your fortune

67
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,114
You know what he said?

68
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,574
I've no idea

69
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,747
Come and eat

70
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,049
He said this is your lucky year

71
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,134
What makes him think that?

72
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,970
I told you, he worked it out

73
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,728
You should take the civil service exam

74
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,687
I'm not interested

75
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,480
Why not?

76
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,149
Why should a sighted man
take a blind man's advice?

77
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,444
Everyone except you wants
to be successful

78
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,237
You're hopeless!

79
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,955
Mother, we may not be rich...

80
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,125
...but we don't starve

81
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,963
When I've saved a little more,
I can open a school

82
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,298
Don't be silly!

83
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,217
You want to be a teacher?

84
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,677
You know the saying...

85
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,347
"Nothing compares to officialdom"

86
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,058
Actually, being a scholar is better!

87
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,602
Why study if you don't want to be an official?

88
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,479
We study to acquire knowledge

89
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,564
But you don't seem to know anything

90
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,778
You're over thirty now...

91
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,530
...but still not married!

92
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,114
Why not?

93
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,617
I'm waiting for the right person

94
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,995
What you mean is, you're too poor!

95
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,127
The Gu family line is going to die out!

96
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,725
"In troubled times, I choose safety..."

97
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,855
"...over jostling for rank and fame"

98
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,606
Don't quote at me!

99
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,360
Save your quotes for the exam!

100
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,951
Oh, you're hopeless!

101
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:19,709
Mother!

102
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:21,752
What's going on?

103
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,838
I...

104
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,715
<i>I was looking...</i>

105
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,718
...to see if anyone was there

106
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,637
Have you gone mad?

107
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,389
No-one lives here

108
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,557
Come home!

109
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,894
Come on!

110
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,317
NOW!

111
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,112
You shouldn't be out at this hour

112
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,990
See how dirty your clothes are!

113
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,109
<i>Mr. Gu...</i>

114
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,445
May I ask something?

115
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,404
Of course

116
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,284
I hear that Fort Jinglu is near here

117
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,410
It is

118
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,662
Have you been there?

119
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,622
I live next to it

120
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,377
They say it's haunted

121
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,257
Only those who believe in ghosts!

122
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,019
Mr. Ouyang...

123
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,105
I'll mount the finished portrait

124
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,982
Please tell me tomorrow if you like it

125
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,108
Thank you

126
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:13,573
It's better to be wary of ghosts

127
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,577
Confucius says, don't speak of such things

128
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,082
I'm afraid I can't agree

129
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,334
Goodbye

130
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,895
"it's better to be wary of ghosts..."

131
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,907
"Taoist exorcism spells"

132
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,247
Mother!

133
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,541
What's all this?

134
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,963
I...

135
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,426
You're behaving like a madman

136
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,388
Let me introduce you

137
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,432
This is Miss Yang

138
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,726
This is my son

139
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,325
Come

140
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,706
Miss Yang...

141
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:13,711
Just ask if there's anything you need

142
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,385
Who is she?

143
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,179
Our new neighbour

144
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,890
You terrified her last night

145
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,100
She scared me too

146
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,479
She's very brave to live there alone

147
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,940
Same as us, she pays no rent

148
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,362
Shengzhai

149
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,535
Mother, why did you visit her?

150
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,287
I gave them some needles and thread

151
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,748
They have nothing there

152
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,085
Mother...

153
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,298
Who else is living there?

154
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,177
Her bed-ridden mother,
who must be eighty

155
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,848
What's that stick for?

156
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,060
Oh, nothing

157
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,438
What do they do for a living?

158
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:18,150
Miss Yang sells funeral offerings

159
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,903
She can't be earning much

160
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,409
You're well over thirty...

161
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,702
Not again!

162
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,454
Don't interrupt me!

163
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,332
Miss Yang is single and in her twenties

164
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,042
Why shouldn't you marry her?

165
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,211
Don't "huh" me

166
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,546
They need someone to depend on

167
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,880
And you're not going anywhere

168
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,799
You'd make a good couple

169
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:45,761
But Mother...

170
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:46,762
What?

171
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,848
Will she agree?

172
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,185
Why not? Aren't we
good enough for them?

173
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,854
It's all up to you

174
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,356
Isn't this just wishful?

175
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,485
Don't be silly, they have nothing!

176
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,279
She has nothing to lose by marrying

177
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:04,947
She'll agree

178
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,242
I'll talk to her mother tomorrow

179
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,421
Come back early today

180
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:35,491
Mother!

181
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,409
You scared me!

182
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,495
Why aren't you at work?

183
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,663
What did she say?

184
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,249
No

185
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:53,967
Where are you going?

186
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,135
To the shop

187
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,097
It's going to rain, don't go today

188
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,228
What did her mother say?

189
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,565
She wants her to get married

190
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,734
But Miss Yang says no

191
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,444
Why?

192
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,447
She wouldn't say

193
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:18,075
She must think we're too poor

194
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,577
If only you had an official rank

195
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,079
Not that again!

196
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,414
Take the exam this year!

197
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,711
I've said many times...

198
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:30,629
What?

199
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,550
If you had an official post,
she would have agreed

200
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,509
Mother...

201
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,679
Go on painting all day and
you can forget about marrying

202
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,763
Mother!

203
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,104
Excuse <i>me...</i>

204
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,107
No one answered,
so I took the liberty of coming in

205
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,359
Sorry, we were out

206
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,237
This is Mr. Ouyang. My mother

207
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,573
Please have a seat

208
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:58,824
Pleased to meet you

209
00:35:58,907 --> 00:35:59,950
Do sit down

210
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,910
The place is in a mess

211
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:02,995
Please excuse us

212
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,206
It's a nice room

213
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,332
Very small

214
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,334
- It's quiet here
- Have a seat

215
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,004
Why weren't you in your shop today?

216
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,798
I had some family business here

217
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,679
I called at your shop this morning

218
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,930
Sorry...

219
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,182
Your portrait is ready

220
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,434
Give me your frank opinion

221
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,646
It's very good

222
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,814
You're too kind

223
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,281
A man of your talents
is wasted in this small town

224
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,453
I'm an ordinary man, not so ambitious

225
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:48,290
Why not take the county exam this year?

226
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,250
You think he stands a chance?

227
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,836
Mother!

228
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,424
With his talent I'm sure he does

229
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,300
You flatter me

230
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,885
Didn't I tell you?

231
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,470
You must try this year

232
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,684
If you enter, I may be able to help

233
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,061
There's no need

234
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,065
I said you needed connections!
That's wonderful!

235
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,359
I'll be happy to help

236
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:19,238
I'm much obliged,
but I won't enter this year

237
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,283
Please ignore him, we're relying on you

238
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:23,909
Mother!

239
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:24,618
Just be quiet!

240
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,332
Do think it over

241
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,501
When you've made up your mind,
tell me

242
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,628
A token of my respect...

243
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,130
It's not my best work

244
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,340
Please take it as a gift

245
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,258
Impossible!

246
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,884
You're giving me too much!

247
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,594
My set price is 5 taels

248
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:48,016
That's enough, Shengzhai!
Mr. Ouyang is a friend

249
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,725
Mr. Ouyang!

250
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,436
Good-bye, Mrs. Gu

251
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:53,397
I'll visit again

252
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,524
Mother, you...

253
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,777
Shall I add your name?

254
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:00,612
Please do

255
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,449
I'll pick it up from the shop

256
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,326
It's raining, take care

257
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,287
- Please visit anytime
- Goodbye

258
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,926
What a nice man

259
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,138
You should get to know him better

260
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,961
Stop!

261
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,921
Who is it?

262
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,552
Who's there?

263
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,194
General Shi

264
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,571
Who?

265
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:45,300
Help!

266
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,646
The fortune-teller!

267
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,355
Mr. Shi!

268
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,404
Are you badly hurt?

269
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:06,488
It's all right

270
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,281
I slipped and fell

271
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,742
You're bleeding

272
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:11,660
Where's my cane?

273
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,787
Never mind that, come into the dry

274
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,373
Where's my cane?

275
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,879
My Cane!

276
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,131
Where's my cane?

277
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,258
You have a bad gash

278
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,300
My Cane!

279
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:28,885
I'll get some medicine

280
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,222
My Cane!

281
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,306
I'll look for it

282
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,729
See, Miss Yang

283
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,360
Fetch some firewood

284
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,919
- Ouyang Nian found out who you are?
- No

285
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,088
But who is that fellow?

286
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,261
Tell Lu Ting'an tomorrow

287
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,179
All right

288
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,806
"Lu Ting'an, Herbalist"

289
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,812
You've caught a cold, Mrs. Gu

290
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,648
It isn't serious

291
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:27,319
Yes, I was out helping
the fortune-teller yesterday

292
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:31,364
I got drenched in the heavy rain

293
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:35,410
Last night I had chills,
so I knew I was ill

294
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,246
Dr. Lu will give you medicine

295
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,414
You'll soon recover, Mother

296
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:40,957
What do you know?

297
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:45,712
Boil this twice and drink the liquid,
and keep warm

298
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,923
You'll be well in no time, don't worry

299
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,716
Let's go

300
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,386
The fee...

301
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,222
We can talk about it later

302
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,724
- No, we'd better...
- We'll pay next time

303
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,101
Dr. Lu is a friend, he doesn't mind

304
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,562
You can rest in my shop

305
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,231
No, let's go home

306
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,815
Goodbye

307
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,452
Miss Yang!

308
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,747
Don't you recognize me?

309
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,127
Stop!

310
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,492
I just want to ask you...

311
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:44,039
Do you know
a blind fortune-teller here?

312
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,047
Take a little rest

313
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,632
Wait till we get home

314
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,669
Thank you, Miss Yang

315
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,047
What happened to your face?

316
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,303
Do you feel better?

317
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,559
I'm getting too old

318
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,894
Look at all this medicine!

319
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,914
Miss Yang...

320
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,710
Please take a rest if you're tired

321
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:58,840
Did you know the fortune-teller
Mr. Shi before?

322
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,179
No

323
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,107
Sorry to put you to all this trouble

324
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,234
You've been up all night

325
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,944
You must be exhausted

326
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:26,117
If only I had a daughter-in-law like you

327
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,752
But we're too poor

328
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,170
We're much poorer than you

329
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:45,512
I can't blame you for turning down my son

330
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,430
Get some sleep

331
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:53,645
Shengzhai has no ambition

332
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:56,022
He won't even sit for the county exam

333
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,191
He must have his reasons

334
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:02,612
He's as stubborn as my late husband

335
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,030
He's studied his whole life...

336
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,658
...but didn't want official rank

337
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,786
That's why we're living like this

338
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,623
You should be pleased to have
such a dutiful son

339
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,458
But what good has it done us?

340
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,841
He can't even get a wife

341
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:26,678
With his talents,
he'll surely find a good match

342
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,849
I've given up hoping

343
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:37,230
He's over thirty now,
and my health is failing

344
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:44,320
When I die, the Gu family line will die with me

345
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,598
How much do I owe you, Dr. Lu?

346
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,391
- Later will do
- I insist

347
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,436
Well, one diao and a half is enough

348
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,689
How is your mother?

349
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,065
Much better, thank you

350
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:28,239
There are agents from the
Eastern Group nosing around

351
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,867
I hear their second-in-command, Men Da,
is coming

352
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,244
Goodbye

353
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,918
<i>Dr. Lu...</i>

354
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,337
Do you know a man named Ouyang Nian?

355
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,714
Ouyang Nian?

356
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,469
No, I don't

357
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,262
Never mind, then

358
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,931
Goodbye

359
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,184
Grandpa, how did <i>he...</i>

360
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:11,199
"Don't trust Gu Shengzhai"

361
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:00,641
<i>Mr. Gu...</i>

362
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,727
Come to my home tonight

363
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:56,405
<i>A jug of wine amid the flowers</i>

364
00:51:57,115 --> 00:52:04,497
<i>Having no company, I drink alone</i>

365
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:14,382
<i>I raise the cup and invite the moon</i>

366
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:23,057
<i>With my shadow,
we form a company of three</i>

367
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:32,984
<i>But alas, the moon doesn't drink</i>

368
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:41,325
<i>And my shadow merely follows my body</i>

369
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:51,002
<i>Let the three of us commune,
however briefly</i>

370
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:59,510
<i>Drink and rejoice in springtime</i>

371
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:09,478
<i>The moon reels with my song</i>

372
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:17,987
<i>My shadow moves with my dance</i>

373
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:28,331
<i>While awoke let us seize the moment</i>

374
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:37,381
<i>For we shall part
after drinking our fill</i>

375
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:46,641
<i>Let us our friendship cherish</i>

376
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:58,611
<i>Till the next time,
should we ever meet again</i>

377
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,325
<i>Mr. Gu...</i>

378
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:19,794
<i>Mr. Gu...</i>

379
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,173
You're a lucky man to have such a tryst

380
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,177
Come with me, Miss Yang

381
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:28,803
Mr. Ouyang!

382
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:35,768
Stay back!

383
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,061
Miss Yang!

384
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,687
You come from an honourable family!

385
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:40,272
You have done a shameful thing!

386
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:40,898
Let's go

387
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,191
Keep away!

388
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,647
Mr. Gu, what happened to you?

389
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,233
I slipped and fell

390
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,576
Mr. Gu

391
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,084
Gentlemen...

392
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,711
His Highness the Magistrate
wants to see you

393
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:35,883
What for?

394
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:38,093
You'll know when you get there

395
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:45,893
- Gentlemen...
- Hurry!

396
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,530
- Mr. Gu
- Sir

397
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:00,866
Please make ten copies of this

398
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,242
You'll be paid

399
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,703
Ink!

400
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,039
Take a seat

401
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:25,724
"Yang Huizhen is a criminal at large"

402
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:32,731
"An imperial reward is offered for her capture"

403
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,488
What... what's this for?

404
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,616
Isn't it clear?

405
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,619
Her father was a high official in the court

406
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:48,038
He offended Grand Eunuch Wei

407
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:50,332
So his entire family is condemned to death

408
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,711
It seems his daughter
escaped with her nanny

409
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:54,586
But the girl...

410
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,714
What? Have you seen her?

411
01:01:57,423 --> 01:02:00,342
No, I haven't

412
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:04,722
But if she's the daughter
of an honest official...

413
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,975
Never mind that

414
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:08,809
Just copy the notice

415
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:10,352
Yes, sir

416
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:13,564
Why can't they let her live?

417
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:16,900
The county has no say in the matter

418
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,737
Please start drawing, Mr. Gu

419
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,487
Sir!

420
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:22,823
Sir!

421
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,492
A Captain of the Eastern Group
is on his way here

422
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,787
We'd better receive him

423
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:29,538
Unlock the gate and let him in

424
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:30,581
Yes, sir

425
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,667
The Magistrate?

426
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:34,668
I'll tell him myself

427
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,363
They're arriving

428
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,838
- We're honoured by your visit
- Thank you

429
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,470
Magistrate...

430
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:30,974
Your county is surprisingly lively

431
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,481
- Please forgive us
- Not possible

432
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,319
Your county is sheltering criminals
wanted by the Imperial Court

433
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:46,573
- The penalties are grave
- We are at fault

434
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:53,956
What do you plan to do about it?

435
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:02,840
Sir, I've received orders from the Ministry of Justice
to arrest Yang Huizhen

436
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:05,175
A wanted poster has been issued

437
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:08,846
Copies will be posted tomorrow
on the main thoroughfares

438
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,139
I will dispatch more constables
to find and arrest her

439
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:11,974
You fool!

440
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,396
You think your men can catch her?

441
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:22,401
We can raise the reward for catching her

442
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,986
Out of the question!

443
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,406
She'll be alerted and will get away!

444
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,035
But the Ministry...

445
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,121
I'm in charge now

446
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:39,001
Listen, the Commander will be here soon

447
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,544
You'd better tread carefully

448
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,797
Please advise me

449
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,091
Destroy the posters

450
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,677
Have your most able men on standby

451
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,485
Mr. Gu, stop copying! You'd better go

452
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,237
Yes, sir

453
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:19,249
- Mother! We must leave!
- What happened to your face?

454
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,500
Quick!

455
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:25,672
Come on, hurry!

456
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,678
Quick!

457
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,524
- Should I hide in the temple?
- Yes

458
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,693
- Be careful!
- I will

459
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:48,820
- Watch out for thieves
- Hurry!

460
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,030
Take care!

461
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,424
Miss Yang!

462
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,017
Miss Yang!

463
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:21,520
Miss Yang!

464
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,566
Shengzhai!

465
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:38,704
Mr. Shi!

466
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:41,748
Who are you looking for?

467
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,671
Have you seen Miss Yang?

468
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,797
No, I'm blind

469
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:50,882
I'm sorry

470
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,515
She and the old lady have left already

471
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:03,979
Mr. Shi!

472
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:06,148
She asked me to tell you
to run for your life

473
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:09,317
- Where did she go?
- I don't know

474
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,987
I must find her

475
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:24,583
Mr. Shi!

476
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:28,253
Mr. Shi!

477
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,093
Who are you really?

478
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:38,138
Well, I'm not blind

479
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,557
- Those people...
- Quiet!

480
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,819
Don't move

481
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:17,719
Run!

482
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,316
General Shi

483
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,652
Show yourself!

484
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,445
He knows you!

485
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:41,595
Mr. Gu

486
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,764
Stay away from these people

487
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,851
They're fugitives

488
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:53,273
Run!

489
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,401
Hurry!

490
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,690
I'm all right

491
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:19,729
- Why are you back here?
- Unfinished business

492
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:23,691
You're wanted! The agents from
the Eastern Group are chasing you!

493
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:25,443
What's your plan?

494
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,404
I'll be ready for them

495
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,202
You'll take on all of them?

496
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,080
You should go, Mr. Gu

497
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,669
I can't just leave

498
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:46,589
Why not?

499
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:49,717
We're almost like a married couple

500
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,302
We should help each other

501
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,517
That's all over,
don't mention it again

502
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,864
Then just think of me as
a friend who wants to help

503
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:14,951
This is a life-or-death fight

504
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:18,079
How do you think you could help?

505
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,793
It will take strategic planning to
win a fight like this

506
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:34,012
And you have a strategy?

507
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,932
We're outnumbered,
we need a strategy to win

508
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:48,318
If you'll just trust me, I'm sure I can help

509
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:59,329
I'm in great danger now

510
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:03,416
I have no choice but to trust you

511
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:04,375
Good!

512
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:09,589
- Then you...
- ...but I don't want to get you involved

513
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:10,924
Don't worry about me

514
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,801
Just tell me what's behind all this

515
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,139
"Know thyself and victory is thine"

516
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,056
Lu Ding'an...

517
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,400
Pay those scoundrels no heed

518
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:07,415
Two days ago I wrote to the Emperor

519
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:11,502
I sent the report of your investigation

520
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:15,173
It lists the 24 crimes of Eunuch Wei

521
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,177
And the illegal activities
of the Eastern Group

522
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,262
Here are some copies

523
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:26,142
Take them to our friends in Donglin Academy

524
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,063
Your report might not
reach the Emperor

525
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:31,856
Then I shall seek an audience
with His Majesty

526
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:32,732
That might work

527
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,784
But if the report falls into
Eunuch Wei's hands...

528
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:43,910
...he will be merciless

529
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:48,164
I won't let that stop me

530
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:51,751
Sir...

531
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,587
An imperial envoy is here
with men from the Eastern Group

532
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,426
Prepare to receive him

533
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:01,177
Yes, sir

534
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,627
- Your Excellency
- A decree from His Majesty

535
01:18:34,711 --> 01:18:35,712
Yes, sir

536
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,046
Shall we proceed?

537
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,381
Certainly

538
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:43,219
All kneel to receive
His Majesty's decree

539
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,014
Long live the Emperor

540
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:54,105
"Yang Lian, you are hereby summoned..."

541
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:59,485
"...to an immediate audience
with His Majesty"

542
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,237
"By the Emperor's command"

543
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,701
Long live the Emperor!

544
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:00,463
Yang Lian

545
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:06,511
Is it correct that you
mentioned my name...

546
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:09,972
<i>...in</i> your report to the Emperor?

547
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,265
Yes

548
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:14,268
You've made false accusations
against Eunuch Wei

549
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:17,313
I reported only facts!

550
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,777
Very forthright!

551
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:28,658
But you have embezzled two million taels
from military funds...

552
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:31,327
What do you say to that?

553
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,205
It's outrageous

554
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,958
If you accuse me of such crimes...

555
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,919
...no-one will believe a word of it

556
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:43,089
So you won't confess?

557
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:46,676
You forged an Imperial Edict
to get me here

558
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,386
I'll inform His Majesty

559
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:55,768
Apply torture

560
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:23,462
My father suffered at their hands

561
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,507
They tortured him to death

562
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,969
Generals Shi and <i>Lu...</i>

563
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,139
...helped me to escape from the capital

564
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,438
That's Mr. Shi and Dr. Lu

565
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,780
But Eunuch Wei was relentless

566
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:54,660
He had Eastern Group agents
scour the land to find us

567
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:01,834
The generals took me to the
very border of the country

568
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,209
Go!

569
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,287
Go!

570
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,342
That way

571
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:21,594
Hide

572
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:33,355
Go!

573
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,161
Do not be alarmed

574
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,372
They will not dare trouble you here

575
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,498
Did you see three people passing this way?

576
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:18,085
Before he died, he told his disciples...

577
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:19,128
I'm talking to you!

578
01:29:34,787 --> 01:29:36,246
What happened here?

579
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:43,087
A while ago your men
stooped to violence

580
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,756
Fortunately we intervened...

581
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,927
...and saved those people from grievous harm

582
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:51,637
Sir...

583
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,312
You're a monk

584
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:02,648
You should practice meditation in your temple

585
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,775
Not meddle in worldly affairs

586
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:46,752
There is no reason to shed blood
in a Buddhist land

587
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:52,090
Master, they will surely go on
to make more trouble

588
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,093
You have travelled far

589
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:57,971
Please take some rest in our monastery

590
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:23,747
Please...

591
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,920
This way

592
01:32:54,069 --> 01:32:56,905
We stayed in the monastery for two years

593
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:01,660
Abbot Huiyuan taught me
how to defend myself

594
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:10,711
The world may be vast...

595
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:13,714
...but there is no safe place for us

596
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:17,384
Maybe Abbot Huiyuan could help again...

597
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:18,635
He will not

598
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:20,387
What about Magistrate Xu Zhengqing?

599
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,847
A just man like him will surely help

600
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:29,521
They say Eastern Group commander
Men Da is coming

601
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,065
It's a purported military exercise

602
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:34,234
But in fact he and his deputy Nie Qiu
are after you

603
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,695
What will you do?

604
01:33:37,988 --> 01:33:42,826
I want to ambush them en route

605
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,787
No

606
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,414
We must find a way to sap their strength

607
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,709
HOW?

608
01:33:51,752 --> 01:33:53,712
Here's a map of Fort Jinglu

609
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,507
You know the lie of this land

610
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:05,724
We should set a trap for them right here

611
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:13,857
I've been a student of military strategy
since I was a child

612
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:17,653
If they can be lured here...

613
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:20,822
...I can find a way to crush them!

614
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,964
Lu Qiong! What's the matter?

615
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,721
Miss Yang, Ouyang left for
Green Bamboo Hill this morning

616
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:50,477
Could he be retreating?

617
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:52,896
No

618
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:55,941
I think Men Da's men are arriving

619
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:04,783
We can't let Ouyang Nian make contact

620
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:53,373
Wait!

621
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,625
They're Men Da's bodyguards

622
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:56,710
They're very highly skilled

623
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,504
Take them one at a time

624
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:15,312
Go!

625
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,055
Captain!

626
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:01,181
Captain!

627
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:02,223
Leave me alone

628
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,982
"Office of the Magistrate"

629
01:41:22,118 --> 01:41:23,078
Captain!

630
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:27,082
Magistrate...

631
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:28,166
Sir!

632
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:30,960
Bring a brush and ink

633
01:41:31,753 --> 01:41:33,171
Write a letter for me

634
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:34,380
Yes, Captain

635
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:39,135
Write...

636
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:40,220
Yes?

637
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:45,683
"To Commander Men Da
of the Eastern Group"

638
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:50,522
"Survivors from Donglin Academy lie in wait here"

639
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:53,525
"Halt your advance"

640
01:41:54,484 --> 01:41:58,488
"Ouyang Nian"

641
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:16,589
Dispatch it immediately

642
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:19,801
He has already left the capital

643
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:21,845
Hurry!

644
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:27,851
If there's any delay,
I'll have your head

645
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:28,893
Yes, sir

646
01:42:39,946 --> 01:42:40,989
Who was that?

647
01:42:42,574 --> 01:42:43,408
Nobody

648
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:46,369
Keep everyone out

649
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:49,873
Yes, sir, I've told the guards outside

650
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,085
Captain, your wounds...

651
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,672
I've taken medicine

652
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,591
Now I must lie still

653
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:03,386
I must have quiet

654
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:04,470
Yes, Captain

655
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,164
- General Lu
- Magistrate Xu

656
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:32,916
He's badly wounded

657
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:49,224
Who is it?

658
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:54,354
Captain, your wounds are grave

659
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:56,064
I've brought a doctor

660
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,901
I told you...

661
01:44:01,486 --> 01:44:02,904
...to let no-one in!

662
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:10,495
It’s you!

663
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:12,497
Captain Ouyang

664
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:20,171
Lu Ding'an...

665
01:44:21,798 --> 01:44:23,091
You timed this well

666
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:26,386
I'm here to treat your wounds

667
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:25,945
We must lure Men Da here

668
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,535
Write to him!

669
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:57,268
A letter for His Excellency

670
01:45:58,811 --> 01:45:59,354
Wait

671
01:45:59,437 --> 01:46:00,313
Yes, sir

672
01:46:10,031 --> 01:46:10,823
What is it?

673
01:46:10,907 --> 01:46:13,326
Sir, a message from Ouyang Nian

674
01:46:14,369 --> 01:46:15,495
What does he say?

675
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:25,004
"Everything is ready for your arrival"

676
01:46:27,673 --> 01:46:29,384
He says they are fully prepared

677
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,719
Then let's advance

678
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:33,679
Forward!

679
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:24,290
Men Da will set up base at Fort Jinglu

680
01:48:24,373 --> 01:48:25,291
When?

681
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,460
After he finds Ouyang Nian

682
01:48:28,211 --> 01:48:29,879
How many men are with him?

683
01:48:29,962 --> 01:48:31,297
Around two hundred

684
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:33,716
We're outnumbered

685
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:37,136
We start by sapping their morale

686
01:48:40,723 --> 01:48:41,974
I don't understand

687
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:47,271
Spread the rumour that
Fort Jinglu is haunted

688
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:50,483
Surely that's too...

689
01:48:52,235 --> 01:48:53,361
No, do it

690
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:57,823
I think my mother could help with this...

691
01:49:03,663 --> 01:49:05,373
I've seen a ghost!

692
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:07,041
One night...

693
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:10,294
...I saw someone standing on the fort

694
01:49:10,378 --> 01:49:14,423
He was this small at first sight

695
01:49:14,507 --> 01:49:16,133
But when I looked again...

696
01:49:16,217 --> 01:49:17,635
...he grew bigger and bigger

697
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:19,804
I tried to look more carefully.
What a shock!

698
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:43,869
Sir!

699
01:49:50,835 --> 01:49:52,169
My respects, your Excellency

700
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:53,879
Have you found Ouyang Nian?

701
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:55,381
No

702
01:49:55,965 --> 01:49:58,426
Have you been to the fort?

703
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:00,553
Well?

704
01:50:01,304 --> 01:50:02,513
Your Excellency...

705
01:50:02,597 --> 01:50:08,769
We hear the place is in ruins,
ravaged by wars

706
01:50:12,523 --> 01:50:13,524
Well then, clean it up

707
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,154
Sir...

708
01:50:18,863 --> 01:50:21,240
It's said that... the place is dirty

709
01:50:22,867 --> 01:50:23,659
Meaning what?

710
01:50:25,161 --> 01:50:26,412
It's rumoured that...

711
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:29,915
...there are ghosts

712
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,293
That's ridiculous

713
01:50:33,628 --> 01:50:35,254
Don't listen to such talk

714
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:36,672
MOVE in there tomorrow

715
01:50:40,885 --> 01:50:41,886
Yes, sir

716
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:44,740
Station a few men outside

717
01:51:44,824 --> 01:51:45,449
Yes, sir

718
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:46,534
You four, stand guard

719
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:47,284
Yes, sir

720
01:51:48,703 --> 01:51:49,662
Go in

721
01:52:24,822 --> 01:52:25,781
Chief...

722
01:52:52,433 --> 01:52:54,143
You! Stop!

723
01:53:07,364 --> 01:53:08,699
Stop! Stop!

724
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:11,452
What's going on?

725
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:12,203
Look!

726
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:18,417
Come on

727
01:53:57,581 --> 01:53:58,582
Ready?

728
01:54:08,884 --> 01:54:10,052
What do you want?

729
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:35,160
Ghosts!

730
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:39,665
Ghosts!

731
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:42,835
Sir!

732
01:54:42,918 --> 01:54:44,336
There are ghosts outside!

733
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:02,229
Did this really happen?

734
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:05,441
Yes, I saw them myself

735
01:55:07,151 --> 01:55:10,863
I've heard many tales about
ghosts and demons

736
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:13,657
BUt I've never seen one

737
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:16,118
I'd like to see for myself

738
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:23,292
Sir, you have the burden of command here

739
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:26,128
I don't think you should take the risk

740
01:55:27,212 --> 01:55:28,881
Ghosts won't bother us

741
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,386
It's said they fear violent men!

742
01:55:35,095 --> 01:55:36,013
But...

743
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:42,144
Don't fall for this nonsense

744
01:55:42,227 --> 01:55:46,398
The stupid locals spread these
rumours to make trouble

745
01:55:46,482 --> 01:55:50,152
But our men believe the stories

746
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:59,912
Maybe this is all a plot

747
01:56:02,331 --> 01:56:04,708
What do you think, Magistrate?

748
01:56:08,045 --> 01:56:10,214
Yes, Your Excellency is surely right

749
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:24,353
He doesn't believe it?

750
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:34,321
It seems he's starting to
suspect the magistrate

751
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,536
No need for all this trouble

752
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,622
Let's just kill them in the
magistrate's office tonight

753
01:56:43,706 --> 01:56:45,249
That would ruin our plan

754
01:56:45,332 --> 01:56:49,044
We should lure them here tomorrow night

755
01:56:54,383 --> 01:56:57,970
Then let's send Men Da a gift tomorrow

756
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:13,777
It's Ouyang Nian

757
01:57:20,576 --> 01:57:21,535
Magistrate...

758
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:22,202
Sir!

759
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:26,707
Where was Ouyang Nian's body found?

760
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,667
Near Fort Jinglu

761
01:57:37,843 --> 01:57:40,137
Captain Ouyang died in your area

762
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,889
Evidently he was murdered

763
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:43,098
What do you have to say?

764
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,851
I am to blame

765
01:57:53,484 --> 01:57:54,651
Excellent!

766
01:57:55,194 --> 01:57:56,487
Guards!

767
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:59,490
Take him away and confine him

768
01:58:00,866 --> 01:58:01,742
Your Excellencies...

769
01:58:02,534 --> 01:58:04,870
I have something to report!

770
01:58:10,751 --> 01:58:11,794
Speak

771
01:58:13,128 --> 01:58:16,131
It's confidential, could you...

772
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:31,438
Now, speak

773
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:39,738
Yang Huizhen!

774
01:58:43,826 --> 01:58:45,202
Isn't she Yang Liam's daughter?

775
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:47,037
Yes

776
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:49,373
She has two renegade generals with her

777
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:51,291
Splendid

778
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,961
All three of them are here

779
01:58:56,046 --> 01:58:56,588
Who else?

780
01:58:57,881 --> 01:59:01,385
I heard they are gathering bandits

781
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:05,264
They plan to storm into town
to kidnap you

782
01:59:08,392 --> 01:59:09,768
We'd better strike first

783
01:59:09,852 --> 01:59:11,728
Sir, if you permit me to
command the troops...

784
01:59:11,812 --> 01:59:13,730
...I can finish them all off tonight

785
02:00:11,288 --> 02:00:13,957
We're ready, Sir

786
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:08,739
Help!

787
02:02:12,451 --> 02:02:13,660
Don't move

788
02:02:18,582 --> 02:02:19,750
What is it?

789
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:21,710
Sir, it's... true!

790
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:22,627
An ambush?

791
02:02:22,711 --> 02:02:23,462
Ghosts!

792
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:26,590
Two dead!

793
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:32,721
Sir, the rumours are true

794
02:02:32,804 --> 02:02:35,015
Ridiculous! Be alert for an ambush

795
02:02:48,403 --> 02:02:48,987
What is it?

796
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:50,155
Look, <i>sir...</i>

797
02:02:57,162 --> 02:02:58,372
Sir, maybe we should...

798
02:02:58,455 --> 02:03:00,082
Try to calm them down!

799
02:03:02,918 --> 02:03:04,127
Hold your positions!

800
02:03:42,916 --> 02:03:44,292
Sir...

801
02:03:44,376 --> 02:03:46,128
Please tell the commander...

802
02:03:46,211 --> 02:03:48,422
Men can't fight ghosts

803
02:03:49,172 --> 02:03:52,050
We should return in daylight

804
02:03:52,134 --> 02:03:53,760
We're soldiers, we've done terrible things

805
02:03:53,844 --> 02:03:57,931
Our deeds have spawned ghosts!

806
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:04,563
Sir, I think...

807
02:04:05,814 --> 02:04:07,816
You're usually a sharp fellow!

808
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:10,569
Can't you see this is a plot to trick us?

809
02:04:10,652 --> 02:04:11,653
Yes, sir

810
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:15,198
To make us fear we've
offended the gods

811
02:04:16,074 --> 02:04:17,492
You've attained high rank

812
02:04:17,576 --> 02:04:20,036
How can you believe such nonsense?

813
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:24,166
Sir, I've just talked with other officers...

814
02:04:24,249 --> 02:04:25,333
What? Mutiny?

815
02:04:31,882 --> 02:04:33,175
Don't panic! Protect His Excellency!

816
02:05:17,636 --> 02:05:18,470
Don't let her get away!

817
02:06:17,862 --> 02:06:18,863
It's Shi Wenqiao

818
02:08:35,083 --> 02:08:36,793
Sir, they must be inside

819
02:09:01,401 --> 02:09:02,152
Someone's there

820
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:21,981
Sir...

821
02:10:23,066 --> 02:10:24,400
I'll keep watch here

822
02:10:24,943 --> 02:10:26,736
You two go in and search

823
02:11:52,864 --> 02:11:55,700
Miss Yang, please spare me!

824
02:11:55,992 --> 02:11:59,203
"A woman's empathy is her weakness"

825
02:14:29,687 --> 02:14:32,398
"Funerary Tablet of Yang Lian"

826
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:47,361
Miss Yang!

827
02:18:55,995 --> 02:18:57,163
It's you!

828
02:19:12,345 --> 02:19:14,138
Miss Yang!

829
02:19:32,406 --> 02:19:33,449
Miss Yang!

830
02:20:23,374 --> 02:20:24,875
Master, have you seen Miss Yang?

831
02:20:28,170 --> 02:20:30,005
Where is she?

832
02:20:34,552 --> 02:20:36,720
Have you seen Miss Yang?

833
02:21:19,472 --> 02:21:20,431
Mother!

834
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:25,853
Have you seen Miss Yang?

835
02:21:26,979 --> 02:21:28,105
Yes, I saw her

836
02:21:28,814 --> 02:21:29,940
Where is she?

837
02:21:35,905 --> 02:21:37,198
She asks you not to look for her

838
02:21:42,578 --> 02:21:44,163
I must find her

839
02:24:30,996 --> 02:24:34,625
"I have entered the monastery.
The Gu family has its heir"

840
02:27:02,689 --> 02:27:05,526
<i>Yang Huizhen, this matter remains unresolved</i>

841
02:27:05,651 --> 02:27:08,779
<i>If I attain enlightenment, you will follow me</i>

842
02:27:09,488 --> 02:27:11,782
<i>Gu Shengzhai is in danger</i>

843
02:27:11,865 --> 02:27:13,951
<i>Go with General Shi</i>

844
02:29:04,728 --> 02:29:07,022
"Wanted: Gu Shengzhai"

845
02:30:18,010 --> 02:30:18,885
That's him!

846
02:30:21,096 --> 02:30:22,264
Catch him!

847
02:30:55,047 --> 02:30:55,964
Run!

848
02:32:02,322 --> 02:32:03,365
Retreat!

849
02:33:20,442 --> 02:33:22,110
That's their commander-in-chief, Xu

850
02:35:20,228 --> 02:35:21,354
General Shi

851
02:35:22,022 --> 02:35:22,939
Miss Yang

852
02:35:26,526 --> 02:35:29,070
I'm the new commander of the Eastern Group, Xu

853
02:35:29,154 --> 02:35:31,740
My respects to General Shi

854
02:35:32,282 --> 02:35:32,991
I am honoured

855
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:35,744
His Excellency Eunuch Wei orders <i>me...</i>

856
02:35:35,827 --> 02:35:37,996
...to invite you to the capital for consultations

857
02:35:40,749 --> 02:35:43,877
Please inform Eunuch Wei that
Miss Yang and <i>I...</i>

858
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:46,046
...have retired from service to the Court

859
02:35:46,129 --> 02:35:48,131
We will not return to the capital

860
02:35:49,174 --> 02:35:52,719
Then I should say that
you're to be put on trial

861
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:56,431
All the more reason not to obey

862
02:35:57,015 --> 02:36:00,185
Then there is nothing I can do for you

863
02:36:01,853 --> 02:36:04,564
I suggest you reconsider

864
02:37:18,596 --> 02:37:19,889
You take the fat one

865
02:37:21,808 --> 02:37:22,350
Go!

866
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:09,290
Stay back!

867
02:42:29,615 --> 02:42:31,159
Commander Xu

868
02:42:32,243 --> 02:42:34,537
You are Abbot Huiyuan?

869
02:42:35,288 --> 02:42:36,372
I am

870
02:42:39,459 --> 02:42:41,419
You are celebrated in monastic circles

871
02:42:42,128 --> 02:42:46,257
Why are you harbouring criminals?

872
02:42:46,340 --> 02:42:48,342
Isn't your reputation at risk?

873
02:42:50,470 --> 02:42:53,765
I've not turned my back
on the secular world

874
02:42:53,848 --> 02:42:56,726
General Shi once held high rank

875
02:42:56,809 --> 02:42:58,936
Miss Yang is from a noble family

876
02:42:59,479 --> 02:43:04,317
Evil men attacked them,
so they fled in despair

877
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:06,235
They wished to live in peace and seclusion

878
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:10,782
But they have been hounded
by agents of the Eastern Group

879
02:43:11,532 --> 02:43:13,701
The agents do their duty

880
02:43:14,744 --> 02:43:19,332
You know how unjustly the
Donglin Academy is persecuted

881
02:43:20,625 --> 02:43:23,836
For Buddha's sake,
show compassion and mercy

882
02:43:25,713 --> 02:43:27,882
A man cannot compromise

883
02:43:27,965 --> 02:43:30,927
And the Emperor's edicts must be obeyed

884
02:43:33,054 --> 02:43:37,517
Tell Eunuch Wei that they've entered the monastery

885
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:41,521
On my advice, they've renounced worldly affairs

886
02:43:42,355 --> 02:43:46,526
It's beyond reason to hear a monk
challenging the law!

887
02:43:47,276 --> 02:43:48,903
Commander Xu...

888
02:43:48,986 --> 02:43:52,073
You were once a petty clerk
in the eunuchs' bureau

889
02:43:52,156 --> 02:43:54,784
How dare you disturb our peace?

890
02:43:55,910 --> 02:43:56,536
Now go

891
02:43:58,412 --> 02:44:00,998
I will arrest you for sheltering criminals!

892
02:44:02,875 --> 02:44:04,877
Get this evil creature out of my sight

893
02:45:42,850 --> 02:45:43,935
Lay down your weapons

894
02:46:24,183 --> 02:46:24,558
Stay back!

895
02:48:18,631 --> 02:48:19,590
Depart

896
02:48:45,991 --> 02:48:46,784
Stay back!

897
02:48:56,252 --> 02:48:56,961
Master!

898
02:48:57,044 --> 02:48:58,629
His evil is not yet expunged

899
02:48:59,255 --> 02:49:00,089
General Shi!

900
02:51:33,867 --> 02:51:34,868
Master

901
02:51:38,998 --> 02:51:41,500
Master, please take me in

902
02:51:44,169 --> 02:51:46,547
You are not free of worldly bonds.
Go back

903
02:51:52,011 --> 02:51:55,514
Master, I've killed many people

904
02:51:57,099 --> 02:52:00,227
Phantoms haunt my dreams at night

905
02:52:02,187 --> 02:52:04,106
Sometimes I have visions

906
02:52:05,399 --> 02:52:07,943
Sometimes I feel gnawing pains

907
02:52:10,696 --> 02:52:13,407
I wake in a cold sweat

908
02:52:14,408 --> 02:52:16,660
I have no wish...

909
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:21,915
...other than to end my days
in the monastery

910
02:52:22,791 --> 02:52:26,587
Good! If you repent, you'll be saved

911
02:52:27,421 --> 02:52:29,256
Penitence is the answer

912
02:52:31,925 --> 02:52:36,513
Master, take me in
or I shall kneel here forever

913
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:42,227
The sea of suffering is boundless,
come ashore

914
02:52:42,311 --> 02:52:43,354
Arise

915
02:56:17,818 --> 02:56:18,569
Brother!

916
02:56:21,863 --> 02:56:22,447
Father!

917
02:59:27,799 --> 02:59:31,762
THE END

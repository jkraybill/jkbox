Official Residence of the lyi Clan

33
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:16,590
You were a retainer of the former
Fukushima Clan in Hiroshima?

34
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,924
Correct.

35
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,220
My name is Tsugumo Hanshiro.

36
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,516
Written with the character "Tsu"
for "harbour"

37
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,269
and "Gumo" for "cloud".

38
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,565
What is the nature of your visit?

39
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,028
The house of my master fell in 1619.

40
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,532
Subsequently, I left the domain
and moved here to Edo,

41
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,160
where I found shelter
in a back-alley tenement.

42
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,871
While eking out a meagre living,

43
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:52,459
I sought connections
for employment with a new master.

44
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,173
But try as I might,
we live now in times of peace,

45
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,384
and my every effort has been in vain.

46
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,888
Failing to find employment
and with little to do,

47
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,432
he finds himself in dire straits

48
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,144
and believes that
he can endure it no further.

49
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:17,526
Rather than live on
in such poverty and disgrace,

50
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,863
he wishes to die honourably
by committing harakiri

51
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:26,409
and asks for permission
to use our forecourt.

52
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,746
Such is his request, sire.

53
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,000
Not again?

54
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,671
Will it never stop?

55
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,133
How shall I respond, sire?

56
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,014
Fine. Show him in, then.

57
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,458
This way.

58
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,253
Please enter.

59
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,342
Thank you.

60
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,869
I am a former retainer

61
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,998
of Lord Fukushima Masanori
of Hiroshima.

62
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,543
Tsugumo Hanshiro by name.

63
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,464
I respectfully beg your favour.

64
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,761
I am senior counsellor
of the House of lyi, Saito Kageyu.

65
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:11,056
I am much obliged
for this immediate interview.

66
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,934
The purpose of my visit...

67
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,311
I've already been told of your request.

68
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:22,317
Rather than live on in endless poverty,
idly waiting for death,

69
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,196
you wish to end your life
in a manner befitting a samurai.

70
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,450
I believe that was the gist of it.

71
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,577
Indeed.

72
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,748
In these times,
your resolve is truly admirable.

73
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,418
I can only express the highest esteem.

74
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:47,050
You mentioned that you served
the former Lord Fukushima.

75
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,304
Did you happen to know a man
named Chijiiwa Motome?

76
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,182
Chijiiwa?

77
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,851
Yes.

78
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,230
Well...

79
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,357
You don't recognise the name?

80
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,987
I'm quite certain he said he'd served
the former Lord Fukushima.

81
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,992
In its prosperous days,
the clan's retainers

82
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,369
numbered some 12,000 men.

83
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,622
One could hardly know them all.

84
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,083
I see.

85
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,961
But never mind that.

86
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:27,090
Earlier this year,
perhaps around the end of January,

87
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,636
this ronin named Chijiiwa Motome
came calling.

88
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,306
The purpose of his visit
was the same as yours.

89
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,437
He requested the use of our forecourt
to dispatch himself with honour.

90
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,648
Is that so?

91
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:54,617
Would you like me to tell you
what happened in that case?

92
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,746
I would indeed.

93
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,081
You say you were a retainer

94
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,751
of the former Fukushima Clan
in Hiroshima?

95
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,086
Correct.

96
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,590
I served the former
Lord Fukushima Masanori of Hiroshima.

97
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,718
My name is Chijiiwa Motome.

98
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,929
And what is the nature of your visit?

99
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,974
After the fall of my master's house,

100
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,686
I moved here to Edo and found
shelter in a back-alley tenement.

101
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,732
While eking out a meagre living,

102
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,903
I sought connections
for employment with a new master.

103
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,032
But try as I might,
we live in times of peace,

104
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,952
and my every effort has been in vain.

105
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,341
So now it seems it's our turn.

106
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,679
How shall we respond?

107
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,306
Let me think.

108
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,104
It's amazing how such foolishness
can take hold.

109
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,773
Blame it on what the Sengoku Clan did.

110
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,193
- Say what you will, that was a mistake.
- No, Yazaki.

111
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,488
- That's not necessarily true.
- Why not?

112
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,241
The fellow who went
to the Sengoku house

113
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,077
was serious about committing harakiri.

114
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,996
There was nothing dishonourable
about his intent.

115
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,667
It was precisely because
they were touched by his sincerity

116
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:30,630
that the Sengoku house decided
to take him in as a back-room retainer.

117
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,509
That was good.
They made the right decision.

118
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:41,224
The problem is the shameless
imitators who have followed.

119
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,436
They have no intention whatsoever
of performing harakiri,

120
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,189
and just because they're hurting
a little for food and clothing,

121
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,151
they show up at our gate
to practise their pathetic extortion.

122
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,905
We can't very well allow him
to disembowel himself in our gateway.

123
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,034
Our only choice is to follow
the example of other clans,

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,246
and give him a little something
and ask him to leave.

125
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:07,167
No. That will not do.

126
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,130
If we give him money and send him away,

127
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,841
he'll soon be followed by others.

128
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,343
One after the other,

129
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,346
like ants drawn to a mound of sugar.

130
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,642
Ever since the Battle of Sekigahara,

131
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,645
Edo has been teeming
with masterless samurai.

132
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,233
They're like wild dogs
roving about in search of prey.

133
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,780
Think what people will say...

134
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,871
"Everybody thought that
the House of lyi had backbone,

135
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:48,374
"so up until now,
the ronin avoided their gate.

136
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,172
"But look what they've done now.

137
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,008
"They boast of their martial valour,

138
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,427
"but this is a time of peace,

139
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,014
"so they're just living
through yesterday's dreams."

140
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:09,395
Would you have such derisive chatter
spreading all over Edo?

141
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,191
Especially when our lord
is away in his domain.

142
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,859
Under no circumstances

143
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:19,405
can we allow a stain
on our lord's name while he's away.

144
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,535
Giving him money
and asking him to leave,

145
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,872
such lily-livered nonsense
is out of the question.

146
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,669
He hasn't the slightest intention
of killing himself,

147
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,588
yet he speaks of honourable harakiri.

148
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,423
Counsellor!

149
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,512
If I may...

150
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,459
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

151
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,723
I am Kawabe Umenosuke,
a member of Lord lyi's mounted guard.

152
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,727
My name is Chijiiwa Motome,
a ronin from Hiroshima.

153
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,272
Kindly come with me.

154
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,442
- Excuse me?
- I am to show you to the bath.

155
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,742
Since Lord lyi is at present
away in his domain,

156
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,244
Counsellor Saito conveyed your request

157
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,456
to His Lordship's son, Bennosuke.

158
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,335
He finds your resolve most admirable

159
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,087
and wishes to grant you
an immediate audience.

160
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:04,844
So... I am to have an audience
with Master Bennosuke?

161
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,387
Correct.

162
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,893
I must beg your pardon,
but your present attire will not do.

163
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,898
While you refresh yourself in the bath,

164
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,068
we'll arrange for some new robes
for you.

165
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,988
I place myself in your hands.

166
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,617
Your kindness overwhelms me.

167
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,257
I must be dreaming.

168
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,218
This is so...

169
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,597
...completely unexpected.

170
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,891
Almost...

171
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,518
Pardon me.

172
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,492
My apologies
for keeping you waiting so long.

173
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,287
I must ask you to change again.

174
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,541
Your robes.

175
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,406
Is something wrong?

176
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,993
What about my audience
with Master Bennosuke?

177
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,665
I was told I'd be granted an audience.

178
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,792
I don't believe so.

179
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,254
- You must have misunderstood.
- No, I'm quite certain.

180
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:08,259
That was the word I received
from Kawabe of the mounted guard.

181
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,095
Kawabe?

182
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,974
Now that you mention it...

183
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,270
That must be it.

184
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,941
So I'm not mistaken?

185
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,111
I believe I understand.

186
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,993
When Counsellor Saito conveyed
your desire to Master Bennosuke,

187
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:40,208
he noted how rare it was these days
to find men with such a sense of honour.

188
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,253
"I would like to add this man
to the ranks of our retainers", he said.

189
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:52,178
"But when a man declares that
he wishes to cut his belly open,

190
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,473
"it can only come
from a most profound resolve.

191
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,187
"I am sure it would be no use
trying to dissuade him.

192
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,814
"Grant him his final wish.

193
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,486
"I would like to meet this man
of uncommon valour

194
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,656
"and tell him how much
I admire his purpose.

195
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:16,410
"Unfortunately I am scheduled to go
to Lord Dot's residence at this hour.

196
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,331
"Extend to him every courtesy
of this house,

197
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:25,628
"and have all our retainers
witness his final act,

198
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,714
"that they may remember it
as a proud example."

199
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,926
Such were Master Bennosuke's words,
I was told.

200
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,113
Tell me, what do you think
of this story?

201
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,825
A most interesting tale,

202
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,787
worthy of the famous red armour
that symbolises the House of lyi

203
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,748
and its reputation
for great martial valour.

204
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,503
May I ask what your intentions are?

205
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,839
You mean...

206
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,593
...about this?

207
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,220
Exactly.

208
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,810
You may set your mind at ease.

209
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,980
I came here
with every intention of dying.

210
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,567
Well, well.

211
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,362
A most admirable resolve.

212
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,868
In that case, Master Tsugumo...

213
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,164
...perhaps I should recount for you

214
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,250
a little more of Chijiiwa Motome's story.

215
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,045
By all means.

216
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,882
Now then, we must be aware of the time.

217
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,051
Please change into those robes.

218
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,263
All other arrangements
are already in place

219
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,807
for a harakiri ceremony
with all the proper formalities.

220
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,773
I have a request.

221
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,486
I must beg a brief respite.

222
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,821
Respite?

223
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:20,201
I will not run or hide.
I will return to this house.

224
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,328
But I beg you for a day or two respite.

225
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,415
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

226
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,252
- But this is absurd!
- Absurd?

227
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,592
We made the harakiri arrangements
at your own request.

228
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,011
My most abject apologies!

229
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,139
Just a day or two respite.
I will return without fail.

230
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,685
A samurai's word is his bond.

231
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
There can be no delay!

232
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,649
Master swordsman Yazaki Hayato.

233
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,112
Fit and eager,
his skills honed to perfection.

234
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,324
One false step
and he'll cut you in two.

235
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,620
The others will descend on you as well.

236
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,713
Rather than being chopped up
like a dead fish,

237
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,258
perform harakiri
and die like a samurai.

238
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,304
Now, change into those robes.

239
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,796
O, ancestors of the House of lyi,

240
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,760
I must beg your forgiveness
for defiling the mansion courtyard

241
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,929
with unworthy ronin blood.

242
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,279
I do this to preserve
the honour of this house,

243
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,407
as well as that of the Tokugawa family

244
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,703
and of the samurai code itself.

245
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,584
I beg you to be witness to my decision.

246
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,592
His short blade is the same.

247
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,177
Look at it.

248
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,848
It wouldn't cut tofu.

249
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:17,396
He sells off his soul as a samurai,
replacing his blades with bamboo,

250
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,441
and then says he wants
to perform harakiri?

251
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,651
The nerve of the man!

252
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,283
Everything is in place
for the ceremony to begin.

253
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,843
Master Chijiiwa Motome...

254
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,181
Rather than wait for death
in dire poverty,

255
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:56,143
you've declared your wish
to die honourably by harakiri.

256
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,189
It is a commendable decision.

257
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,651
You are an example for all samurai.

258
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,780
I am ashamed to admit it,

259
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,158
but even in this house
known for martial valour

260
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,578
since our ancestor Naomasa's day,

261
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,207
the resolve you've shown
is seen but rarely.

262
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,671
So they may witness
the noble demise of a true warrior

263
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,674
and engrave its lasting impression
upon their minds,

264
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,094
I've ordered all retainers
of this household to attend.

265
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:36,100
May your heart be at peace.

266
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,271
I beg of you!

267
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,732
What is it?

268
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,236
I beg for a brief respite,
a day or two's grace!

269
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,700
I swear I will not run or hide.
I'll return to this spot without fail!

270
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,160
Please! I implore you!

271
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,164
This is most unexpected.

272
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,794
I've heard lately of incidents
all across Edo

273
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,798
in which ronin, who don't deserve
to call themselves samurai,

274
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:13,220
demand the use of a clan's forecourt
to commit harakiri,

275
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,099
but are happy to walk away
in exchange for a few coins.

276
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,477
Surely you're not...

277
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,398
Absolutely not, sir.

278
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,442
No, no.

279
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,193
Of course not.

280
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,490
I'd never believe that a man
of your noble character and mien

281
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,286
could be such
a despicable extortionist.

282
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,497
Now then.

283
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,458
You may proceed.

284
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,727
Unworthy as I am,
I shall be your second.

285
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,774
I am an exponent
of the Shindo-Munen-lchi school.

286
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,449
I imagine you are aware,
but let me note just to be sure.

287
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:21,205
The rite of harakiri
has changed over time.

288
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,042
In recent years,
it is often harakiri in name only.

289
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,253
The subject reaches for the blade
on the wooden stand,

290
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,007
and his second immediately
strikes off his head.

291
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,345
In other words,
there is no disembowelment at all,

292
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,266
and in fact sometimes
the stand holds not a short sword

293
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,435
but only a folding fan.

294
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,522
However,

295
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:52,027
our proceedings today will not sink
to such debased and empty forms.

296
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,948
We shall adhere strictly
to the traditional ways.

297
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,327
Is that understood?

298
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,958
You will rip your bowels open
crosswise, like this.

299
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:12,005
Once I see you have done so,
I will strike off your head.

300
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,012
Until I'm satisfied
you've fully torn open your bowels,

301
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,473
I will not bring down my sword.

302
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,226
Is that understood? Now then.

303
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,933
It is your own sword.
That is the blade you will use.

304
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,772
A samurai's sword is his soul.

305
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,528
No blade could be more fitting
for this purpose than your own.

306
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,187
Come. What keeps you?

307
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,274
Proceed!

308
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,073
Strike me!

309
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,534
Strike me!

310
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,495
No, not yet!

311
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,456
Pull your blade across!

312
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,521
Why do you delay?

313
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,483
Draw your blade across!
Pull it to the right!

314
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,867
I suppose he had no other recourse,

315
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,370
but even so, to bite off his tongue?

316
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:57,290
Would you say he was being
resourceful or just unseemly?

317
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,960
Then again,

318
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:04,756
who in his right mind attempts
harakiri with just a bamboo sword?

319
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,219
Now then...

320
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,140
What are your intentions?

321
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,061
You mean...

322
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,523
...about this?

323
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,987
The account I've just given you

324
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:31,199
of Chijiiwa Motome's fate
is true in every detail.

325
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,371
Take my advice, Master Tsugumo.

326
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,499
Quietly take your leave.

327
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:44,463
You need have no such concerns with me.

328
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,801
Unlike this Chijiiwa fellow...

329
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,306
...the sword in my belt
is not made of bamboo.

330
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,684
I will not bite off my tongue,

331
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,229
I will disembowel myself in grand form.

332
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,569
Very well.

333
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,030
Master Tsugumo,

334
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:14,534
since you are unswerving in
your resolve, I shall grant your wish.

335
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,661
- Attendant!
- Sire?

336
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,170
This ronin from Hiroshima,
Master Tsugumo Hanshiro,

337
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,340
is to be granted use of the courtyard
to perform harakiri.

338
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,179
His present dress will not do.

339
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,723
Give him fresh robes befitting one
who journeys to the next world...

340
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,308
If I may.

341
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,893
What is it?

342
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,022
Please do not trouble yourselves
over such things.

343
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,360
For the final moments
of a down-and-out ronin like myself...

344
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,032
...surely nothing is more fitting
than the clothes I now wear.

345
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:17,639
I am deeply grateful for the courteous
and considerate treatment

346
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,975
that you have accorded me today.

347
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,605
I can find no adequate words
to thank you.

348
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,358
Thus, I shall begin.

349
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,031
Might I ask, Counsellor,

350
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,702
who will be serving as my second?

351
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,582
I have assigned Shinmen Ichiro.

352
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,044
Master Shinmen?

353
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,176
Did you wish for someone else?

354
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,178
Yes, sir.

355
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,641
I would like to request
Master Omodaka Hikokuro.

356
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,893
You request Hikokuro?

357
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,855
I believe he's a retainer in this house.

358
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,151
I've heard he's trained
in the Shindo-Munen-lchi school.

359
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,111
Indeed.

360
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,531
Hikokuro is a fine choice.

361
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,074
Hikokuro?

362
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,748
I'm afraid he's not
in attendance today.

363
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,587
He sent a note saying he's ill
and requesting a few days' rest.

364
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,673
I see. That's too bad.

365
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,593
Master Tsugumo,

366
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,764
as you heard,
Omodaka is not present today.

367
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,018
You will need to make another choice.

368
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,314
That is most disappointing.

369
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,778
I had my heart set on Master Omodaka
performing the service.

370
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,239
I wonder if I might not beg
his special consideration.

371
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,580
Well, he says he's ill,
but he seemed fine yesterday.

372
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,292
Surely it can't be anything serious.

373
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,213
Messenger!

374
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:26,226
Make all due haste
to Omodaka's residence.

375
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:30,397
Tell him to come immediately,
if his illness permits. Now hurry.

376
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,699
I'm putting you
to a great deal of trouble.

377
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,826
Please accept my apologies.

378
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,329
Now then,

379
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,082
do you wish to wait here?

380
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,418
Or would you like
to come inside and relax?

381
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,086
No.

382
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,756
The comfort of your residence
might cause my resolve to waver.

383
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:04,013
My journey into eternity mustn't
grow distasteful. I shall remain here.

384
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,226
You display remarkable discipline.

385
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,438
I can but express my admiration.

386
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,735
If I may, Counsellor,

387
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,489
it could be quite tedious for us both
to sit here and wait in silence.

388
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,452
To pass the time,

389
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,872
perhaps you'll allow me
to tell you a little about myself.

390
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,794
About yourself?

391
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,213
Yes.

392
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,968
The hardscrabble tales of a half-starved
ronin don't amount to much,

393
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,387
but what befalls others today

394
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,599
may be your own fate tomorrow.

395
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,270
Perhaps your retainers

396
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,649
will find some small point or two
worth remembering

397
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,319
among my otherwise useless ramblings.

398
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,990
"What befalls others today
may be your own fate tomorrow"?

399
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,248
Well, this could be amusing.

400
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,673
I want everyone here
to listen carefully.

401
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,927
The words of one
staring death in the face...

402
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,681
...are unlikely to be
useless ramblings.

403
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:34,062
I'm sure we'll all learn something.

404
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,482
Counsellor.

405
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,324
That tale you related earlier...

406
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:51,621
...may I be assured
it was true in every detail?

407
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,752
Indeed.

408
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,633
The ronin from Hiroshima
named Chijiiwa Motome

409
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,303
was a man of some acquaintance to me.

410
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,908
Chijiiwa Motome...

411
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:35,456
...was a man
of some acquaintance to me.

412
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,664
<i>Motome was a lad of 15,</i>

413
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,462
<i>and my daughter Miho
was an angelic child of 11.</i>

414
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,256
<i>That was 11 years ago.</i>

415
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:30,261
<i>But when I close my eyes,</i>

416
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:36,434
<i>their images come back to me vividly,
as if it were only yesterday.</i>

417
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,998
- My turn again.
- Never mind.

418
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,460
All we do is count stones all day
to repair the castle walls.

419
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,879
We won't need bows and arrows
for a long while.

420
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,091
"The world is at peace.
The four seas are calm."

421
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:15,014
Incidentally, this coming 22nd

422
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,433
is the seventh anniversary
of Nut's passing.

423
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,479
I knew it was soon,
but is it seven years already?

424
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,110
Yes, and I'm planning
a modest ceremony at my residence.

425
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,113
- But don't bring any offerings.
- Very well.

426
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,449
I can hardly believe it.

427
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,576
Seven years already.

428
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,164
What never ceases to amaze me

429
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,292
is how a rough warrior like you

430
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,255
has managed to raise Miho all these
years without taking a second wife.

431
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,217
Jinnai... look who's talking!

432
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:56,764
When your Yuki died, I wondered
how you would ever manage.

433
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,474
But look at you.

434
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,812
You're a perfect example
of the kite begetting a hawk.

435
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,480
Kite begetting a hawk?

436
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,607
You were the widower kite,

437
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:11,446
doting on your child
in every aspect of his upbringing.

438
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,031
And lo and behold,

439
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:18,077
the child grew not into a kite
but a magnificent young hawk.

440
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,704
Nonsense!

441
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,043
He certainly keeps growing,
but he's got a long way to go

442
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,421
before you can compare him
to a hawk soaring overhead.

443
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:35,803
I never figured either of us would be
good for anything but battlefield laurels,

444
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,890
but we haven't done too badly
at raising our children.

445
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,485
Had life gone on like that,
all would have been well.

446
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,114
But it was not to be.

447
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,870
When all is said and done,

448
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,666
our lives are like houses
built on foundations of sand.

449
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,669
One strong wind and all is gone.

450
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,010
How my master's house
with its 498,000-koku domain

451
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,221
was brought to ruin...

452
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:23,768
I'm sure you already know
even better than I do myself.

453
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,690
Due to an unreasonable judgement
by the Tokugawa shogunate

454
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:34,070
regarding the repairs being performed
on Hiroshima Castle,

455
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,949
in June 1619,

456
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:42,161
my master, Fukushima Masanori,
was ordered into exile at Kawanakajima,

457
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:46,332
leaving his 12,000 retainers
without any means of livelihood...

458
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,670
...through no fault of their own.

459
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,953
Jinnai!

460
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,586
To Tsugumo Hanshiro

461
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:40,761
<i>"In view of our long-standing friendship,
I ask your indulgence in the following.</i>

462
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,973
<i>"The castle repairs commissioner,</i>

463
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,767
<i>"the Honourable Fukushima Masakatsu,</i>

464
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,604
<i>"will be electing death at any moment.</i>

465
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:55,776
<i>"Therefore, I will precede him
on his journey.</i>

466
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,988
<i>"My company alone will suffice,</i>

467
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,533
<i>"I beg you not to follow.</i>

468
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,330
<i>"Regarding my only child, Motome,</i>

469
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,751
<i>"he has grown tall,
but he is still only 15.</i>

470
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,672
<i>"Please look after him
as he finds his way in life."</i>

471
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,229
Why was he so hasty?

472
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,982
Committing harakiri
even before I have done so.

473
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,860
Hanshiro, I forbid you to follow.

474
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,739
If the house could still be saved,
I would allow it.

475
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,993
But with the house abolished,
it would be pointless.

476
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,997
- Jinnai's company will suffice.
- But, sire...

477
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,124
Don't be foolish, Hanshiro.

478
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:58,422
Jinnai died because he knew
you would if he didn't.

479
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,342
He died to accompany me
on your behalf as well.

480
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:06,430
Which means, Hanshiro,
that you must now live on.

481
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,767
Both for you and for Jinnai.

482
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:19,610
Also for his son, Motome.
Who will look after him if not you?

483
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,536
I go now to meet Jinnai.

484
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:34,292
Hanshiro, is there anything
you'd like me to tell Jinnai?

485
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,756
Do you have nothing for me
to say to him?

486
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,300
Tell Jinnai...

487
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,760
Tell Jinnai this.

488
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:52,184
Have no fears about Motome.

489
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,854
I will watch over his path to manhood.

490
00:46:55,938 --> 00:47:01,485
I will not fail him.
I swear this on my life.

491
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,449
Go on, Master Tsugumo.

492
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,839
What did you find out?

493
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,801
It seems his illness
is indeed most serious.

494
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,095
What is the nature of his ailment?

495
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,680
According to his family,

496
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,851
a high fever and excruciating pains
in all his joints.

497
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,187
Go on.

498
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,690
I asked if I might visit him
at his bedside,

499
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,818
but he sent word back
that his pain was so great

500
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,821
that he did not wish to be seen
in his present state.

501
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,368
All I could do was convey
the message you sent and return.

502
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,745
It seems there's nothing we can do.

503
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:58,209
Perhaps he was overcome
by the relentless heat of recent days.

504
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:06,008
Master Tsugumo, you heard what he said.

505
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,930
I must ask you to select
someone else as your second.

506
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,895
I am sorely disappointed,
but it appears I have no choice.

507
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,607
In that case...

508
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,738
I would ask for Master Yazaki Hayato.

509
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,492
Hayato?

510
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:39,333
Inaba, am I to believe he too has
been absent these four or five days?

511
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,793
Correct, sire.

512
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,672
He requested leave
because he wasn't feeling well.

513
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,008
Master Tsugumo,

514
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,556
I'm afraid Yazaki Hayato
is also absent due to illness.

515
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,727
Master Yazaki is also ill?

516
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,814
I'm sorry to hear that.

517
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,404
Again, it seems I have no choice.

518
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,451
Then I request Master Kawabe Umenosuke.

519
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,373
Counsellor,

520
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,627
surely it's not possible

521
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,465
that Master Kawabe is also
under the weather?

522
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:42,938
Well, well.

523
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,817
It seems he is indeed indisposed.

524
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:54,158
All three of them unavailable
on this particular day,

525
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,162
what a very odd coincidence.

526
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,167
Most curious.

527
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,427
- He's up to something.
- Clearly so.

528
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,848
Hikokuro was the one who first insisted

529
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:22,353
that Chijiiwa Motome be forced
to go through with harakiri.

530
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,065
Yazaki was the one

531
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,528
who discovered his blades were
bamboo and insisted he use them,

532
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,947
and Kawabe was quick to agree.

533
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,200
That's why I urged that he at least
be spared the bamboo blade...

534
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:39,161
- Of what good is that now?
- Indeed, sire.

535
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,000
But how shall we deal with him?

536
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,254
I doubt he intends
to meekly disembowel himself.

537
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,340
He obviously has something
up his sleeve.

538
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,636
Whatever it is...

539
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,765
...he won't get away with it.

540
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,395
We'll force his hand
and make him commit harakiri.

541
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,773
In fact, if he refuses,

542
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,902
we'll fall upon him and cut him down.

543
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,161
What happens within the walls
of this compound...

544
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,208
...is as secret as what happens
behind the walls of our own castle.

545
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,173
One signal from me
and everyone will know what to do.

546
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:40,431
But I'm bothered about Hikokuro
and the other two.

547
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,311
I need to send someone
to find out more.

548
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,230
Under the circumstances,

549
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,900
I'd like you personally
to find out the real story.

550
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,041
Master Tsugumo...

551
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,466
Summer days are long,
but the hour advances.

552
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,140
I must ask you to proceed
without further delay.

553
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,184
But, Counsellor,

554
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:28,062
the ritual cannot take place
without a second.

555
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,022
I understand your concern,

556
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,150
but I've discussed the matter
with my senior colleagues.

557
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:38,614
With all three men of your choice ailing,
we cannot accommodate your wishes.

558
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,325
You will have to accept our selection.

559
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,578
Shinmen Ichiro!

560
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,874
I command you to serve
as second for Master Tsugumo.

561
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,670
Perform your duty with care.

562
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,381
I must protest!

563
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,051
To act as my second,

564
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,596
I have named three
specially selected men.

565
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:07,518
I must have one of these three.

566
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,438
Are you perhaps deaf?

567
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:19,154
All three you name are ill
and are not present today.

568
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:24,743
I explained this very clearly.
Did you not hear?

569
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,375
Then in that case, I have no choice.

570
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,796
I must call off my harakiri for now.

571
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:40,008
Enough, Tsugumo Hanshiro!

572
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,178
Your scheme for extortion
has gone too far.

573
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:49,476
It's bad enough to march in here
demanding a place to perform harakiri.

574
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,063
But then you quibble endlessly
over naming your second.

575
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,358
You never intended to commit harakiri.

576
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,402
All you really want is money...

577
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,028
Counsellor!

578
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,490
If I were the extortionist you say,

579
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,827
would I be calmly sitting here
on this platform?

580
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,414
- Then why do you not quietly proceed?
- I am fully prepared to die.

581
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,710
But cutting my belly open
does not in itself

582
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,212
ensure a smooth passage
to the netherworld.

583
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:21,508
I need someone to expeditiously
strike off my head,

584
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,636
a swordsman of reliable skill.

585
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,933
I do not commit harakiri
to atone for a crime.

586
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,770
The least I can expect
is to choose my own second!

587
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,421
Further debate on the matter...

588
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,885
...is clearly a waste of time.

589
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,533
You are a fraud,
a disgrace to our class.

590
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,161
You never intended to commit harakiri!

591
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,150
Insolent dog!

592
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,992
Wait!

593
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,496
Hold back! Wait, I say!

594
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,525
I beg of all those present

595
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,946
a moment, a brief moment.

596
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,618
You can't possibly have
anything more to say.

597
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:56,622
But I do. I do have more to say.

598
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,876
I haven't finished my story.

599
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:05,547
I have no ears
for your endless ramblings.

600
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,341
Counsellor!

601
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,179
If you force me to,

602
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:16,141
I will fight desperately to the death,
no matter the odds against me.

603
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:22,314
Some of your men
will be wounded undeservedly.

604
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,484
Some may even lose their lives!

605
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:32,449
Would it not be better
to simply hear me out?

606
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,121
Once I have finished my story,

607
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,832
I will disembowel myself
without further ado.

608
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,877
Or if you feel harakiri
is too good for me,

609
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,089
you may turn your men on me
to do what they will.

610
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,009
In any event,

611
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:56,431
I would first like you to hear
what I have to say.

612
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:08,527
As to these conditions you stipulate,
do I have your word?

613
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,239
You have my word.

614
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,451
And as a samurai,
you will hold true to it?

615
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,803
Very well, but make it short.

616
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,808
I will not listen
to your useless mutterings for long.

617
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,021
Men, fall back.

618
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,998
Now, where was I?

619
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,296
Oh, yes...

620
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:15,802
My master's house fell
and Chijiiwa Jinnai died.

621
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,389
But before doing so,

622
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:24,186
he asked me to look after Motome.

623
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,318
When my master's house fell,

624
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,906
we immediately left the domain
and moved to Edo.

625
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,911
The streets of Edo
were crowded with ronin,

626
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,205
flotsam from the Battle of Sekigahara.

627
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,710
In former times, other clans would
have gladly taken in any ronin

628
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,546
who'd earned a name for himself.

629
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,467
But in an era no longer in need
of warriors or horses,

630
00:59:55,592 --> 01:00:00,180
so peaceful that no wind even
rustled the leaves on the trees,

631
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:04,267
it was a constant struggle
simply to find a meal.

632
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,979
Indeed, it shames me to recall

633
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,399
our miserable lives
over these last eight or nine years.

634
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:19,658
But amidst all our hardships,

635
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:25,122
my daughter Miho was rapidly
becoming a woman,

636
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:29,126
and soon it was the spring
of her 18th year.

637
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,946
Father.

638
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:04,244
I've set out your lunch
in case I'm not back in time.

639
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:09,207
The greatest delicacies
taste of nothing when eaten alone.

640
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,586
If you're not back, I'll wait.

641
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,838
I'll collect the money for these

642
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,841
and then stop by Yoshizakicho
for some dried fish.

643
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,386
Good day!

644
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,929
Welcome, sir.

645
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,348
Busy as usual, eh? On your way out?

646
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,684
Yes, to the wholesaler in Kyobashi.

647
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,521
The Mikawaya, I suppose. Take care.

648
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,490
Practice makes perfect.

649
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,493
You've become very deft at that.

650
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,120
Forgive me.

651
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:51,875
I hate asking you
for advances all the time,

652
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,085
but my earnings refuse to catch up.

653
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:57,214
You disarm me by beating me to it.

654
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:02,510
I came intending
to lodge a complaint or two,

655
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:06,389
but now that you've made
the first move...

656
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,851
...what can I say?

657
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,562
By the way,

658
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:17,067
what are your thoughts on that matter
I raised the other day?

659
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,532
Have you come to a decision?

660
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,246
Yes, I have decided.

661
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,415
Glad to hear it.

662
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,378
That takes a load off my mind.

663
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,338
No...

664
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:42,008
I appreciate your proposal
regarding Miho,

665
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,346
but I've decided to decline.

666
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:56,898
In the end, her adoption
by the Joshuya family

667
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,110
would be a mere pretext
lasting perhaps six months.

668
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,612
Once established
as a member of their family,

669
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,824
she'd be sent to Lord Sakakibara
as his concubine.

670
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,369
Master Tsugumo,

671
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,747
the Sakakibara are a noble family
with a domain of 110,000 koku.

672
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,583
It may seem odd to seek benefit
from your daughter's connections,

673
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:19,212
but you need do nothing
and doors will open to you.

674
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,256
I understand that.

675
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:26,845
But, Master Seibei, no matter
how much I've fallen on hard times,

676
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,307
I cannot profit from making
my daughter a concubine.

677
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,809
It's fine to uphold your pride.

678
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:37,230
But as a parent, you must consider
your daughter's feelings too.

679
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,107
What?

680
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:42,694
She's young and beautiful,

681
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,947
yet she doesn't have
a single fancy kimono to wear.

682
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:51,995
She can only look forward to endless
days of slaving at her father's side.

683
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:57,208
Master Tsugumo,
you can't fight the world you live in

684
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,794
nor go against the tide of the times.

685
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:04,049
It's a good proposal
for both Miho and for you,

686
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,760
no matter which way you look at it.

687
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,304
In fact, to be honest,

688
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:13,516
is it not precisely because Miho
was blessed with such beauty

689
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,478
that an avenue like this
remains open to you?

690
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,483
Confucius said:

691
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:28,865
"He who knows not the will of heaven
is not a superior man."

692
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,958
"He who knows not proper decorum
must not rise to his feet."

693
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,844
"He who knows not the heart of words
cannot know the heart of man."

694
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,727
That will be all for today.

695
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,106
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

696
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,900
Hey, Katsuzo,
let's go sparrow-hunting today!

697
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,749
Hello, Uncle Hanshiro.

698
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,802
It's good to see you.

699
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,311
Some tea?

700
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,191
- Much obliged.
- Not at all.

701
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:50,029
I know this house well enough
at least to put water on to boil.

702
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,952
As it happens, Motome,

703
01:05:57,245 --> 01:06:00,039
I came today to discuss
a matter of some weight.

704
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,545
You sound so formal, Uncle.
What could it be?

705
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,426
How quickly the days and months fly by.

706
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,512
Miho is now 18.

707
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:19,476
She looks more
like her mother every day.

708
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:25,690
In fact, it's hard to see...
how she could possibly be of my blood.

709
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:31,571
If she'd taken after me,
she'd never have grown so beautiful.

710
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,949
Uncle... what are you trying to say?

711
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,662
Well... Motome...

712
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:48,046
I'd like you to take Miho as your wife.

713
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,806
I realise this is all very sudden,

714
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,227
but what do you think?

715
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,146
Motome?

716
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:10,109
Uncle, you know as well as I
the state of my livelihood at present.

717
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:15,782
I offer classes in the Chinese classics
to a handful of children

718
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,993
and live from hand to mouth.

719
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,375
How could I possibly take a wife?

720
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,545
Do you dislike Miho?

721
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,800
All I'm asking is
how you feel about her.

722
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:46,271
It's not only because of the promise
I made to your father

723
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,065
that I hope you'll marry Miho.

724
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,695
Boorish and dull as I am,

725
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,073
I'm not entirely insensitive
to your feelings for each other.

726
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:04,914
It was more difficult than I expected
to persuade Motome.

727
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:12,130
I didn't realise he had such
a stubborn and wilful streak.

728
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,010
But I knew he loved Miho,

729
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:21,514
and I knew Miho would have
no objections to the match.

730
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:29,480
<i>The crane that lives a thousand years</i>

731
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:36,446
<i>A symbol of myriad joys</i>

732
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:44,037
<i>The tortoise that lives 10,000 years</i>

733
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:51,127
<i>Bears on its back the three worlds
of heaven, earth and man</i>

734
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:57,258
<i>The sands upon the beach</i>

735
01:08:57,383 --> 01:09:01,512
<i>Numberless and smooth</i>

736
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:07,518
<i>May they ever reflect the morning sun</i>

737
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:13,316
After two years, a child was born.

738
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:18,404
It was a boy, and they named him Kingo.

739
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:24,994
Of course, I was the one
who chose the name.

740
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,345
Good day.

741
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,770
What's this? Asleep again?

742
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,702
Father, you're too generous.

743
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,913
Nonsense.

744
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,958
Even after I married you off,
you still cook for me.

745
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:15,670
And besides,
I now have only myself to support.

746
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,464
I save more money
than I know what to do with,

747
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,925
and I can't take it with me!

748
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,640
Well, well.

749
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,892
Did you wake up?

750
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,147
Now, none of that, you little rascal.

751
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,900
A warrior's son should not
be flashing his dimples.

752
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,861
What did I tell you now?

753
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:52,165
Really? Even the Matsudaira Clan
of Dewa province?

754
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,416
That's right.

755
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,711
I can understand abolishing
the domains of newer vassals,

756
01:10:56,836 --> 01:11:01,799
but to treat vassals who've supported
the Tokugawa for years so harshly?

757
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:07,764
The shogunate's policy towards
the <i>daimyo</i> is completely beyond me.

758
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,476
We'll see an increase
in the number of ronin.

759
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,193
Did you hear?

760
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:24,238
One of them tried to commit harakiri
at the Sengoku Clan's gate.

761
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:28,534
A ronin named Oi Shume,
formerly of the Kurume Clan.

762
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,747
I heard the Sengoku were so impressed

763
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,707
that they offered him employment.

764
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,752
That much was fine.
It's what happened next.

765
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,046
Yes, I heard.

766
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,965
Other ronin who got wind of the story

767
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:47,929
began presenting themselves at the
gates of <i>daimyo</i> houses all over Edo,

768
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,890
insisting on committing harakiri
and refusing to budge.

769
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,477
In order to get rid of them,

770
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,563
the houses offered them money to leave.

771
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,442
It's a shameful turn of events.

772
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,820
It certainly is.

773
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:07,073
No matter how hard-pressed they may be,

774
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,367
it's a despicable thing to do.

775
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:15,289
In these difficult times,
it's no help growing desperate.

776
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,795
Becoming too impatient
to seek employment

777
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,965
is a danger we must all
take care to avoid.

778
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,802
You are absolutely right.

779
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,848
If you stop worrying
about finding employment,

780
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:35,810
you can sit here like this
without answering to a superior,

781
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,187
at no one's beck and call.

782
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,902
What's the matter, little one?

783
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,406
It's time for his milk. I'll nurse him.

784
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,367
Don't give him your breast
every time he cries,

785
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,369
or he'll develop bad habits.

786
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:55,788
Lookee here, Kingo. Ready?

787
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,754
All right?

788
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,300
Upsy-daisy. Here we go, Kingo.

789
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:12,847
<i>In Kanda</i>

790
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:18,603
<i>At the Myojin Shrine</i>

791
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:26,068
<i>There's a festival</i>

792
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:29,947
<i>This very night</i>

793
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:37,955
Kingo was the centre of our existence,
and the three of us lived happily

794
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,666
with the constant sound
of warm laughter

795
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,878
raising peaceful ripples around us.

796
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:49,216
It truly was a time
of greater happiness

797
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:52,720
than I'd ever known in the domain.

798
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:05,149
However, good things
never last for long.

799
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,277
<i>"We've been granted to live thus far...</i>

800
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:13,157
<i>"But it won't last forever...</i>

801
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,454
<i>"We're destined to leave this world...</i>

802
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,834
<i>"And there's nothing untoward
about it."</i>

803
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,682
One day, Miho suddenly coughed up
profuse quantities of blood.

804
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,186
She had always been
of weak constitution,

805
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,481
and with the endless burden
of our piecework labour...

806
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:52,655
...she'd driven her frail body
too hard for too long.

807
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,566
Motome panicked.

808
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,196
The poor fellow.

809
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:40,619
Date Clan construction site,
fifty labourers at 40 <i>mon.</i>

810
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:44,582
Fifty labourers at 40 <i>mon.</i>

811
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,130
Just a minute, samurai, sir!

812
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,299
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

813
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,885
There isn't enough work
even for the townsmen.

814
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,137
If the authorities spotted
a two-sworded labourer,

815
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:01,140
I'd be in for a real dressing-down.

816
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:08,147
Hosokawa Clan construction site,
twenty labourers at 45 <i>mon.</i>

817
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,321
Pawn Shop

818
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,584
<i>Poor Motome,</i>

819
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:32,630
<i>he tried everything but to no avail.</i>

820
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,634
<i>Miho was gradually wasting away.</i>

821
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:43,724
<i>And the worst was yet to come.
It's seared forever in my memory.</i>

822
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:47,937
<i>We' d just barely made it
through the end of the year,</i>

823
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,773
<i>and the plum blossoms
had begun to bloom</i>

824
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,776
<i>shortly after the beginning
of the new year.</i>

825
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,883
What's wrong?

826
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,939
Is it Miho?

827
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,236
Is it Miho?

828
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,239
It's Kingo.

829
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,533
What? Kingo?

830
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,746
A fever.

831
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,458
Like he's on fire.

832
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:58,591
Why, Miho?

833
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:01,927
Why did you just sit by
until it came to this?

834
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:07,099
I thought it was an ordinary cold.

835
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,727
What did the doctor say?

836
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:16,192
You did have a doctor see him,
didn't you?

837
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,874
You haven't had a doctor see him?

838
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,128
Why haven't you had a doctor
look at him?

839
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,441
Kingo, fight it off.

840
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:06,325
Your grandpa,
like your mother and father,

841
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,286
has already sold off
everything of value.

842
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:15,459
There's not a thing,
not a thing we can do for you.

843
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:21,840
There's nothing...

844
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,803
...nothing we can do, Kingo.

845
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,391
But you're the son of a samurai.

846
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,893
You can't let a little illness
get the better of you.

847
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,236
Don't let it beat you.

848
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,761
Don't let it... Don't let it...

849
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,602
Father.

850
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:25,529
I have an idea.

851
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,156
What?

852
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:30,326
I need to go out.

853
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,494
Please look after Kingo.

854
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,791
What do you have in mind?

855
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,257
A former retainer of the Kato Clan
now lives in Nihonbashi

856
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,052
and makes his living as a moneylender.

857
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,013
His rates are so high
I didn't dare go to him before,

858
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:55,184
but I can't worry about that anymore.

859
01:20:55,309 --> 01:21:00,314
You're right. If you know such a man,
hurry and go!

860
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,316
I'm on my way.

861
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:05,652
I'll be back by evening at the latest.

862
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,492
As you can see, Miho is too weak,

863
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:14,703
so please take care of Kingo.

864
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,122
Of course. I know what to do.

865
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,250
But, Motome,

866
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,920
you can see he's barely hanging on.

867
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:27,508
You must be quick,
and you mustn't fail.

868
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,804
I'll return by evening without fail.

869
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,140
Until then.

870
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,607
We're depending on you, Motome!

871
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,897
No, no, I'll do that.

872
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:42,833
It won't be long now, Kingo.

873
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,160
What's taking him so long?

874
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:56,448
He's getting worse.

875
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:01,870
What could Motome be doing?

876
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:35,612
No, no. Your getting up
won't do Kingo's fever any good.

877
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:55,674
Where can Motome be?

878
01:24:56,925 --> 01:25:01,054
He swore he'd be back by evening.

879
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:05,350
What could he be doing?

880
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,438
I waited.

881
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:15,485
Every moment felt like an eternity.

882
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,197
But Motome did not return.

883
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:22,618
We never saw him again.

884
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:29,875
"I'll be back by evening,
so please look after Kingo."

885
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:35,088
Those were his final words
as he went out the door,

886
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:39,301
and that was the last I saw
of Chijiiwa Motome.

887
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:51,271
But then,

888
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:57,194
around nine that night,
he did return home.

889
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,198
Only not on his own.

890
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:06,370
He was borne home by a party
of retainers from the House of lyi...

891
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:10,374
...most courteously.

892
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:17,673
This was the request with which
Chijiiwa Motome came to us.

893
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:22,719
But our forecourt is a busy place
and would have been inconvenient,

894
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:27,307
so we offered him our courtyard and
saw to his needs with all due propriety,

895
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:30,811
thus allowing him to fulfil his wish
to commit harakiri.

896
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,942
We understand there have been
incidents all across Edo lately

897
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:40,028
in which ronin present themselves
at the gates of <i>daimyo</i> houses

898
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:44,533
and threaten to commit harakiri
unless given money.

899
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:50,789
This disgraceful practice has put
many houses at a loss as to what to do.

900
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:56,920
But now we have Chijiiwa Motome,
a samurai of true valour,

901
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,424
who carried out his resolve
to die honourably.

902
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:04,928
And we the members of the lyi Clan

903
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,265
responded appropriately
to facilitate his wishes.

904
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:13,311
In contrast to many disgraceful ronin

905
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:17,357
and the spineless timidity
of other <i>daimyo</i> households,

906
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:21,194
both parties in this instance
acted in an exemplary manner

907
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,572
that will open eyes and clear the air.

908
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:28,702
It is truly an occasion
for mutual congratulations.

909
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:31,705
- We bid you...
- Wait.

910
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,501
To avoid any misunderstanding,
show the blades.

911
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,670
That's right.

912
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:42,799
For the record, we wish you to examine
the swords Chijiiwa was carrying.

913
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,475
You will note that
both blades are of bamboo.

914
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,060
Bamboo?

915
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:14,206
As you can see,
both are made of bamboo.

916
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:18,502
No one must accuse us later
of having switched blades.

917
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,713
So take a good look.

918
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,011
Is it clear?

919
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,518
In that case,

920
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:40,190
Motome must have borrowed
a blade from your household?

921
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:43,026
No, he did not.

922
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:47,322
He died magnificently
using his own blade.

923
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:56,414
Motome... killed himself
with that bamboo blade?

924
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,793
Exactly.

925
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,172
The entire household
witnessed the spectacle

926
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,259
of harakiri performed
with a bamboo blade.

927
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:09,928
As you may imagine,
an unsightly affair.

928
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:12,472
It would have been more fitting
for a samurai

929
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:16,560
to end his life with a true blade,
which is a warrior's soul.

930
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,232
- So long.
- We bid you good night.

931
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,010
Miho wept.

932
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,723
She wept...

933
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:21,893
...and wept.

934
01:32:58,364 --> 01:32:59,908
Motome!

935
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,037
Forgive me!

936
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,667
I had...

937
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,921
I had no idea.

938
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:24,974
You had even sold your blades.

939
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:29,771
For Miho's sake,
you even sold your blades.

940
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,500
But I...

941
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,294
But I...

942
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:57,507
...I would never let this go.

943
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:01,010
It never entered my mind.

944
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:04,806
The stupid thing was too dear to me...

945
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:08,434
...and I clung to it.

946
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,604
To this stupid...

947
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:33,668
With his fever still raging
and in a coma,

948
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:38,840
Kingo died two days later.

949
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:42,343
Three days after that,

950
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:46,472
as if chasing after him,

951
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:49,142
Miho died as well.

952
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:59,277
Thus did Tsugumo Hanshiro find
himself utterly alone in the world,

953
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:03,448
having lost every last person
he had ever cared about.

954
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:06,201
Master Tsugumo,

955
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,748
does that conclude your story?

956
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,794
I suppose it does.

957
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,298
No...

958
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,344
...there's one more thing.

959
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:32,060
May all those here listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

960
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:38,942
No matter how grinding
his poverty and hunger,

961
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:42,946
for a samurai to present himself
in someone else's entryway

962
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:46,741
and declare that he wishes
to commit harakiri there

963
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:52,080
is an unspeakable act that
can in no way be excused.

964
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:55,833
Having said that...

965
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:03,424
...the manner in which
the House of lyi handled the matter...

966
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:09,847
...surely left a great deal to be desired.

967
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:15,478
If a samurai risks shame and ridicule

968
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:21,234
to beg for a day or two's grace,
he must surely have good reason.

969
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:27,865
A simple inquiry
as to the reason for the request

970
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:30,243
would have told so much.

971
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:33,997
Yet with this many witnesses present...

972
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,543
...not a single one among you
had the consideration to ask.

973
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:45,758
His wife lay on the very verge of death,

974
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:50,013
while his beloved son burned with fever,
in dire need of a doctor.

975
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:55,476
Motome no doubt wished
to explain the situation to me,

976
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:58,313
make whatever last effort
he could for his son,

977
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,274
before turning all further care
over to me,

978
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,651
and then return here
to the House of lyi.

979
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,361
Tsugumo Hanshiro!

980
01:37:06,904 --> 01:37:09,490
Enough of your self-serving excuses!

981
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:12,577
What?

982
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,246
As to Chijiiwa Motome,

983
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:20,293
the circumstances that drove him here
were no doubt complex.

984
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:25,006
But it was he who declared
his wish to commit harakiri.

985
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:30,261
What followed upon that request
may not have been what he intended,

986
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:32,722
but he reaped what he himself sowed.

987
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:38,478
He was in no position to complain,
or to blame or condemn anyone.

988
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,481
At that point,

989
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:45,735
all he had to do was cast all else
aside and die a magnificent death.

990
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:50,073
To face death without wavering,

991
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:53,034
that is the true way of the samurai.

992
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,411
But what did this man do?

993
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:58,456
He cravenly asked
for a day or two's grace.

994
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:02,794
One might well accuse him
of having gone mad!

995
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,837
True enough.

996
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,299
Motome had indeed gone mad.

997
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:12,178
But I say good for him!

998
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,389
I praise him for it.

999
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:18,226
He may have been a samurai,

1000
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:20,645
but he was also
a man of flesh and blood.

1001
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:23,606
He could not live on air alone.

1002
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:28,277
When a man has reached
the point of no return,

1003
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:31,739
even one as strong as Motome will
go mad trying to protect his family,

1004
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:33,658
and I would praise him for it!

1005
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:37,412
They'll call him the "Bamboo Ronin".

1006
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:43,876
Not only samurai, but townspeople, too,
will scoff at his wavering.

1007
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:48,172
But let them laugh all they want.

1008
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:52,677
Who can fathom the depths
of another man's heart?

1009
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:58,307
Thanks to the shogunate's ruthless
policy of wiping out the provincial lords,

1010
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,643
countless samurai lost their masters

1011
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:05,189
and were cast out
to wander the depths of hell.

1012
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:09,318
How can those who never want for food
or clothing understand their misery?

1013
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:14,740
To those who find Motome loathsome
for his pleading, I ask you,

1014
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:17,702
what if you found yourself
in the same position?

1015
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,496
Would you do any differently?

1016
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:27,378
After all,
this thing we call samurai honour

1017
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:31,299
is ultimately nothing but a façade.

1018
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:33,468
Is that your grievance?

1019
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:37,847
- Grievance?
- Is that what you're trying to tell us?

1020
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:42,351
That samurai honour
is nothing but a façade?

1021
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:44,187
Exactly.

1022
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:50,026
"Even if I say I want
to commit harakiri,

1023
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,653
"they surely won't make me do it."

1024
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:56,032
Such wishful thinking
is where these ronin go wrong.

1025
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,161
If a man says he wants
to commit harakiri, we will let him.

1026
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:03,706
In fact, since he has proposed it
himself, we'll make sure he does.

1027
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,792
That is the policy of the House of lyi.

1028
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:09,921
For us, samurai honour
is no mere façade!

1029
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:31,526
And so Tsugumo Hanshiro too

1030
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:35,947
has come here with no intention
of committing harakiri,

1031
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:39,325
but rather out of deep bitterness

1032
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:44,330
over the manner in which the lyi Clan
treated his son-in-law Chijiiwa Motome,

1033
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,625
and the desire to vent
his many grudges.

1034
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:50,711
Is that what you think?

1035
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:53,381
That's not for me to say.

1036
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:57,009
You can only look into your own heart.

1037
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,471
But all the same,

1038
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:03,474
you have no intention
of letting me leave here alive?

1039
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:06,352
That is my decision to make.

1040
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:09,564
I need make no excuses to you.

1041
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,817
Counsellor,

1042
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:17,363
there is a proverb, "The suspicious
mind conjures its own demons."

1043
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,490
Do you know it?

1044
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:25,705
When I say I will disembowel myself,
I truly mean it.

1045
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:34,839
Yet, even after all I have said,
you still refuse to...

1046
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:41,095
Suppose I were to go on living,

1047
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:44,432
what could I possibly have
to look forward to?

1048
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:52,607
The fact is, I can hardly wait
to join Motome and Miho and Kingo

1049
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:57,987
in that world to which
they have preceded me.

1050
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:03,993
But I would never be able
to look them in the face

1051
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,537
were I to go empty-handed.

1052
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:09,957
I think you can understand that.

1053
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,715
I thought perhaps once I had explained,

1054
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:23,346
even members of the lyi Clan would
surely say, "So that's how it was?

1055
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:29,268
"Perhaps we were overzealous that day
in pressing towards that end.

1056
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:34,940
"Anyone can see that our handling
of the situation was less than ideal.

1057
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:39,695
"In some ways,
perhaps we carried things too far.

1058
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:45,701
"No doubt both parties could have
conducted themselves to better effect."

1059
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:51,248
If I could take with me
even a single word in this vein,

1060
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,793
it would be a comfort to Motome.

1061
01:42:57,088 --> 01:43:03,094
Was this not the most fitting gift
I could hope to offer him?

1062
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:05,680
Such were my thoughts!

1063
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:09,183
But I see now it was nothing
but wishful thinking.

1064
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:12,395
If you can see that,
then it makes the rest easy.

1065
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,564
This world does not bend
to sentimental tales.

1066
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,736
If you really think that samurai honour

1067
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:24,740
is ultimately nothing more
than a façade,

1068
01:43:26,075 --> 01:43:29,036
then you never had a chance
of swaying us.

1069
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,750
So in the end,

1070
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:38,838
these have been nothing but
the useless grumblings of an old man.

1071
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:45,094
But it does no good to lament that now.

1072
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:54,895
Well, then, forgive me
for my long-winded recitation.

1073
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:58,691
I will now proceed with the ritual.

1074
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,864
Tarry a moment.

1075
01:44:07,032 --> 01:44:08,617
Before that,

1076
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:13,873
I must return some items
that belong to this house.

1077
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:39,398
For identification,
I have placed name tags on each.

1078
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:42,610
Please examine them carefully.

1079
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:52,745
Master Yazaki Hayato

1080
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:55,998
and Master Kawabe Umenosuke...

1081
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:01,253
I understand they're both among
the best swordsmen of the lyi Clan,

1082
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:04,423
held in high esteem
for their courage and honour.

1083
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:07,384
But, Counsellor,

1084
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:11,764
gentlemen,
let me set your minds at ease.

1085
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:16,769
I took only their topknots.

1086
01:45:16,894 --> 01:45:19,647
Not their lives.

1087
01:45:26,195 --> 01:45:28,823
In the case of Yazaki Hayato,

1088
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:32,076
it was six days ago.

1089
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:30,152
Hold it!

1090
01:47:39,662 --> 01:47:42,748
In the case of Kawabe Umenosuke,

1091
01:47:42,873 --> 01:47:46,126
it was five days ago, on May 8th.

1092
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,613
However,

1093
01:48:56,739 --> 01:49:01,410
when it came to that master swordsman
of the Shindo-Munen-lchi school,

1094
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:06,790
Master Omodaka Hikokuro,
I had a little more difficulty.

1095
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:12,504
Perhaps aware of what had befallen
Yazaki and Kawabe,

1096
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:15,549
I could not catch him off guard.

1097
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:20,220
In fact, to be honest,
I found myself at quite a loss

1098
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:25,059
as to how to deal with Master Omodaka.

1099
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:30,856
May I enter?

1100
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,035
If you reach for your sword,

1101
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:29,832
I'll slice you in one motion
from shoulder to waist.

1102
01:50:39,675 --> 01:50:41,135
However...

1103
01:50:42,678 --> 01:50:46,056
...I fear the lintel will catch
the tip of my blade.

1104
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:52,563
If you lunge to the side,

1105
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,900
then this pillar will get in the way.

1106
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:04,116
It took a few days to locate your home.
My apologies for the delay.

1107
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:08,162
I ask you to make ready.

1108
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:14,251
This is obviously no place
for a sword duel.

1109
01:51:14,376 --> 01:51:18,005
It's a bit far, but I must ask you
to accompany me to Gojiin-gawara.

1110
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:23,927
As miserable a hovel as this is,

1111
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:27,556
your landlord will be inconvenienced
if you do not return.

1112
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:34,438
And without someone to retrieve your
remains, your soul will wander aimlessly.

1113
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:39,568
I suggest you leave a note.

1114
01:51:45,824 --> 01:51:49,786
It should indicate
you're going to Gojiin-gawara

1115
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:53,248
for a duel with Omodaka Hikokuro
of the lyi Clan.

1116
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:32,777
Taking advantage of the wind
was brilliant,

1117
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:35,614
but a blade can do more than cut.

1118
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:39,659
It can also stab,
or even snap another blade in two.

1119
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:42,245
Swordsmanship untested in battle

1120
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:44,915
is like the art of swimming
on <i>tatami</i> mats.

1121
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:09,314
On the other hand,

1122
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:11,900
I had not seen battle either

1123
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:16,738
since the siege of Osaka Castle
16 years ago.

1124
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:20,075
Taking his head
would have been difficult enough,

1125
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:24,746
but taking only his topknot
proved more difficult still.

1126
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:32,254
Whatever the differences in our skill,

1127
01:57:32,379 --> 01:57:35,590
for a samurai to have his topknot taken

1128
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:38,635
is the same as having
his head stricken off.

1129
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,762
It is an ineptitude, a disgrace,

1130
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:44,766
that can scarcely be atoned for
even by death.

1131
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:49,187
Yet these men claim illness
and shirk their duties

1132
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:53,358
while waiting for their topknots
to grow back. Counsellor!

1133
01:57:57,445 --> 01:58:01,074
This house boasts of its red armour
and its martial valour,

1134
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:03,743
but it seems that even
in the great House of lyi,

1135
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:07,122
samurai honour is nothing more
than a façade.

1136
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:23,555
Madman!

1137
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:26,266
Cut him down!

1138
02:05:20,096 --> 02:05:21,347
Fall back!

1139
02:06:32,543 --> 02:06:35,630
Tsugumo Hanshiro has been killed, sire.

1140
02:06:38,925 --> 02:06:40,843
And our casualties?

1141
02:06:42,136 --> 02:06:44,680
What were the casualties among our men?

1142
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:48,935
Sugita Masakatsu, Uemura Sobei.

1143
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:51,729
Shinmen Ichiro, Yoshioka Uemon.

1144
02:06:51,854 --> 02:06:53,606
Four dead.

1145
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:55,775
Eight more seriously wounded.

1146
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,822
The ronin from Hiroshima,

1147
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:05,618
Tsugumo Hanshiro, committed harakiri.

1148
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:11,124
All our own men died of illness.

1149
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:16,045
The House of lyi has no retainers

1150
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:21,050
who could be felled or wounded
by some half-starved ronin.

1151
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:28,057
Former retainer of the Fukushima Clan,
Tsugumo Hanshiro,

1152
02:07:28,182 --> 02:07:31,644
committed harakiri honourably,
according to his wish.

1153
02:07:31,769 --> 02:07:34,147
All our men died of illness.

1154
02:07:34,272 --> 02:07:37,358
Their deaths have nothing to do
with Tsugumo's.

1155
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:45,992
Furthermore, we cannot allow
any more to die of illness.

1156
02:07:46,117 --> 02:07:49,912
See that the wounded
are treated immediately.

1157
02:08:01,382 --> 02:08:03,759
I have just returned, Counsellor.

1158
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:10,600
Omodaka Hikokuro...

1159
02:08:11,726 --> 02:08:13,895
...last night at his home...

1160
02:08:18,065 --> 02:08:23,779
Kawabe and Yazaki both claim illness.

1161
02:08:24,488 --> 02:08:26,365
- But in fact...
- Fool!

1162
02:08:28,492 --> 02:08:32,413
Why did you not order them
to commit harakiri on the spot?

1163
02:08:32,538 --> 02:08:36,417
Go back at once
and order them to do so!

1164
02:08:38,461 --> 02:08:41,214
And take some skilled swordsmen
with you.

1165
02:08:41,339 --> 02:08:45,927
If they fail to willingly disembowel
themselves, make them do it by force.

1166
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:51,182
Of course, these two men
and Omodaka too,

1167
02:08:51,307 --> 02:08:53,559
did not officially commit harakiri.

1168
02:08:54,852 --> 02:08:56,687
They died of illness.

1169
02:08:58,022 --> 02:09:00,024
Imbecile!

1170
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:06,405
You weren't born yesterday,
you know the ways of the world!

1171
02:09:07,531 --> 02:09:10,534
Do you not realise the implications?
Idiot!

1172
02:09:11,494 --> 02:09:13,579
I am on my way, sire.

1173
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:46,589
<i>The former retainer of the Fukushima
Clan, Tsugumo Hanshiro,</i>

1174
02:10:48,299 --> 02:10:51,510
<i>died by harakiri at six in the evening.</i>

1175
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:57,224
<i>His speech and behaviour
had been erratic.</i>

1176
02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:01,228
<i>Many of those present felt
he showed signs of derangement.</i>

1177
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:05,733
<i>Furthermore, it has become clear</i>

1178
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:08,027
<i>when another former retainer
of the Fukushima Clan,</i>

1179
02:11:08,152 --> 02:11:12,073
<i>one Chijiiwa Motome, asked to commit
harakiri in January of this year,</i>

1180
02:11:12,198 --> 02:11:14,992
<i>we did not err in our chosen response.</i>

1181
02:11:15,117 --> 02:11:18,788
<i>Word of the martial rigour
of this house echoed throughout Edo.</i>

1182
02:11:21,082 --> 02:11:25,169
<i>In the present case too,
word of our resolute handling</i>

1183
02:11:25,294 --> 02:11:28,547
<i>spread across the city
before two days were out.</i>

1184
02:11:28,672 --> 02:11:30,633
<i>As a result,</i>

1185
02:11:30,758 --> 02:11:34,887
<i>on the third day,
in a formal session at Edo Castle,</i>

1186
02:11:35,971 --> 02:11:40,267
<i>Lord Doi took the occasion
to confer words of praise</i>

1187
02:11:40,393 --> 02:11:45,064
<i>upon our young master Bennosuke
as follows...</i>

1188
02:11:46,524 --> 02:11:49,443
<i>"At peace, yet ever vigilant.</i>

1189
02:11:50,778 --> 02:11:53,614
<i>"Let the House of lyi continue
to embrace this principle,</i>

1190
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:58,077
<i>"and your fortunes are sure
to prosper forages to come."</i>

1191
02:11:59,370 --> 02:12:01,622
<i>The 16th day of May,</i>

1192
02:12:02,665 --> 02:12:04,583
<i>1630.</i>

1193
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:28,065
<i>HARAKIRl</i>

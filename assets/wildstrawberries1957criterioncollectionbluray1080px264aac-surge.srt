- A promise is a promise.</font>

110
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,521

that we never can be free together,</font>

113

the fact that you're filthy rich</font>

114
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:25,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and don't need the money.</font>

115
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:31,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A promise is a promise.
And I know Evald respects that.</font>

116
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:34,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Perhaps.
But he also hates you.</font>

117
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,851
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do you have against me?</font>

119
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're a selfish old man, Uncle Isak.</font>

120
00:15:55,611 --> 00:16:00,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're utterly ruthless
and never listen to anyone but yourself.</font>

121
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:06,241

your old-world manners and charm.</font>

122
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:18,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But you can't fool us

123
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Remember when
I came to you a month ago?</font>

124
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:27,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I had a stupid idea
that you might help Evald and me.</font>

125
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So I asked to stay with you
for a week or two.</font>

126
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,971
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Remember what you answered?</font>

127
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:35,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I said I'd be delighted.</font>

132
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:50,731
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did I say that?</font>

133
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:53,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Not only that.
- Oh, no.</font>

134
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:56,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">These were your very words:</font>

you'd better see a shrink.</font>

It's in fashion now."</font>

139
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did I say that?</font>

140

Uncle Isak.</font>

about the house.</font>

143

We have plenty of time.</font>

157
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,251

158
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:26,851

172
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:51,531
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, I've become quite old,

00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:06,731
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Good morning, sweet cousin.
What are you doing?</font>

175
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:09,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Picking strawberries, silly.
Can't you see?</font>

176
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And who shall be favored
with these delicious berries</font>

177
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">picked in the early morn
by a lovely young woman?</font>

178
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nonsense. You know quite well
that it's Uncle Aran's name day today.</font>

179
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I forgot to make a present.</font>

180
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:25,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So he'll get a basket
of wild strawberries instead.</font>

181
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:26,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll help you.</font>

182
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:30,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You see, Sigbritt and Charlotta made
a tapestry and Angelica baked a cake,</font>

183
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:32,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and Anna has painted
a really good picture,</font>

184
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and Kristina and Birgitta
wrote a song that they'll sing to him.</font>

185
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's the best one.
Uncle Aron is stone-deaf.</font>

186
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:41,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He'll be very pleased,
and you're stupid.</font>

187
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you have a darned cute nape.</font>

188
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know you shouldn't do that.</font>

189
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Says who?
- I say.</font>

190
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:53,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Besides, you're an unusually
insufferable young man</font>

191
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:55,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">who thinks he's really something.</font>

192

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm your cousin,
and you're in love with me.</font>

193
00:21:58,331 --> 00:21:59,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">With you!</font>

194
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:03,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come and be kissed on the lips.</font>

195
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:07,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you don't behave, I'll tell Isak
you're always trying to kiss me.</font>

196
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:12,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Little Isak! I could beat him up
with one arm.</font>

197
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:15,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know quite well that Isak and I
are secretly engaged.</font>

198
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So secretly, everyone knows it.</font>

199
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's not my fault that the twins
let the cat out of the bag.</font>

200
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:26,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">When is the wedding?
When is the wedding?</font>

201
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:32,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know which of you four brothers
is the least conceited,</font>

202
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but I think it's Isak.</font>

203
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,331
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Isak is the nicest, anyway.</font>

204
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:39,121
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you're the horridest, nastiest,</font>

205
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:43,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">silliest, stupidest -
I can't find the words to describe you!</font>

206
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Admit you've got
a weak spot for me.</font>

207
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you reek of cigars.</font>

208
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a nice manly smell.</font>

209
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And the twins,
who know <i>most</i> things,</font>

210
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:02,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">say you've been up to no good
with that Berglund girl.</font>

211
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:07,711
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She's not a nice girl, the twins say.
And I agree.</font>

212
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:11,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How pretty you are
when you blush.</font>

213
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:14,451
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You <i>must</i> kiss me.
I can't bear it any longer.</font>

214
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:18,721
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Now that I think of it,
I'm madly in love with you.</font>

215
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- You're just saying that.
- No.</font>

216
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:25,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And the twins say</font>

217
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that you're <i>mad</i> about girls.</font>

218
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:31,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is that true?</font>

219
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:44,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, look what you've done!</font>

220
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:50,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And what will Isak say,
who really loves me?</font>

221
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:55,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm so sad!
You've hurt me so!</font>

222
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:59,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You've made a bad woman of me.</font>

223
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At any rate, <i>nearly.</i></font>

224
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:05,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I never want to see you again,
at least not before brunch.</font>

225
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:09,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have to hurry.
Help me pick up the strawberries.</font>

226
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:13,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, and now I've got
a stain on my apron!</font>

227
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:46,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where's Isak?</font>

228
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:50,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Out fishing with Papa,
and they can't hear the gong.</font>

229
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:57,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Anyway, Papa said
not to wait with brunch.</font>

230
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:49,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">In Jesus' name we take our seat.</font>

this food we eat. Amen.</font>

232
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:04,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Benjamin, go and wash
your hands at once.</font>

233
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How old do you have to be
to learn cleanliness?</font>

234
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I <i>have.</i></font>

235
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:14,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sigbritt, pass Angelica the porridge.</font>

236
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:17,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Your fingernails are filthy.</font>

237
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:20,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hagbart, pass the bread.</font>

238
00:26:21,851 --> 00:26:24,971
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't take so much butter.</font>

239
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:28,521
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Charlotta, the salt is lumpy.
You let it get damp.</font>

240
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:31,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How often have I told you
not to let it sit out?</font>

241
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's <i>paint </i>under my nails.</font>

242
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:36,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Who gathered
the wild strawberries for me?</font>

243
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:39,321
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I did.
- What?</font>

244
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:40,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I did.</font>

245
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:44,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Speak up, dear.
Uncle Aron can't hear.</font>

246
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:46,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I did!</font>

247
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:50,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Fancy your remembering
my name day.</font>

248
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How kind of you.</font>

249
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:58,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Couldn't Uncle have a drink
to celebrate?</font>

250
00:26:58,511 --> 00:27:01,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Never when Papa is not at home.</font>

251
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:05,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Uncle has already had three drinks.</font>

252
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:09,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We saw him when we went out
to bathe at 8:00.</font>

253
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:11,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you've picked berries too.
Thank you.</font>

254
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Twins, speak when spoken to.</font>

255
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:20,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And as you didn't make your beds,
you can dry the silver.</font>

256
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You will do as Auntie says.</font>

257
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Benjamin, don't bite your nails.</font>

258
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,321
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Anna, what are you doing?
Remember you're not a little girl anymore.</font>

259
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:32,421
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want to give Uncle my picture.</font>

260
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Please, Auntie, can't we give him
our presents now?</font>

261
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Where is your present?
- Under the table.</font>

262
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, after we've eaten.</font>

263
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:44,821
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A very advanced work of art:
Fritjof and Ingeborg.</font>

264
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:48,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can't tell which is Fritjof!</font>

265
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:54,071
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What were Sara and Sigfrid doing
In the wild strawberry patch?</font>

266
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:57,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We saw you! We saw you!</font>

267
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,061
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The twins ought to be muzzled.</font>

268
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:02,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The twins will be quiet
or leave the table.</font>

269
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:06,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- No freedom of speech, eh?
- Shut up, you brats.</font>

270
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:10,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sara's blushing! Sara's blushing!</font>

271
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:14,061
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sigfrid is blushing too!
Sigfrid and Sara! Sigfrid and Sara!</font>

272
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Quiet, everybody!</font>

273
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But Sara!</font>

274
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:23,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They're lying! They're lying!</font>

275
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:54,921
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Isak is so fine and good,</font>

276
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so moral and sensitive.</font>

277
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He wants us to read poetry</font>

278
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and talk about the next life</font>

279
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:10,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and play four-handed piano.</font>

280
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:15,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And he only wants to kiss
in the dark,</font>

281
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:18,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and he talks about sin.</font>

282
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:22,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's on such a terribly high level,</font>

283
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:25,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I feel so worthless.</font>

284
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:30,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I <i>am</i> worthless -
there's no denying it.</font>

285
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:37,851
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But sometimes it sees to me
that I'm a lot older than Isak,</font>

286
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:40,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you know what I mean.</font>

287
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:45,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And then I think he's a child,
although we're the same age.</font>

288
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:51,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And Sigfrid is so bold and exciting,
and I want to go home.</font>

289
00:29:51,711 --> 00:29:53,851
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't want to be here all summer</font>

290
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:56,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and be an object of ridicule
for the twins and all of you.</font>

291
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,451
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't want to!</font>

292
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:00,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll speak to Sigfrid.</font>

293
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:02,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If he doesn't behave,</font>

294
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll make sure he's made to study
during the summer holidays.</font>

295
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Papa will fix that
as easy as anything.</font>

296
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:09,821
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He too thinks Sigfrid is a
good-for-nothing and needs to work.</font>

297
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Poor little Isak
who's so good to me.</font>

298
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:17,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How unfair everything is.</font>

299
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:21,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">All will be well, you'll see.</font>

300
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:24,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Listen, now they're singing
for Uncle Aron.</font>

301
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:30,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How silly to write a song
for a deaf old man.</font>

302
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How typical of the twins.</font>

303
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:37,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Flowers nod, grasses bow</i></font>

304
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:42,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Around our lovely house</i></font>

305
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:48,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>We our Uncle Aron celebrate</i></font>

306
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>And with our song</i></font>

307
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:55,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Ornament his brow</i></font>

308
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:59,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Four cheers for Uncle Aron.</font>

309
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:04,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!</font>

310
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:13,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll run down and meet
Isak and Uncle.</font>

311
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You do that.</font>

312
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:21,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I was overwhelmed by feelings
of emptiness and sadness,</i></font>

313
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:26,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>but was soon awakened
from my reveries</i></font>

314
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:30,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>by the voice of a young girl
asking me repeatedly about something.</i></font>

315
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:33,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Is this your house?
- No, it's not.</font>

316
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:36,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're lucky to be telling the truth.</font>

317
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:39,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's my dad who owns the whole
headland, including the house.</font>

318
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:43,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I lived here once.
Two hundred years ago.</font>

319
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, yeah?</font>

320
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:49,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Is that your car up at the gate?
- Yes, that's my car.</font>

321
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:54,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Looks antique.
- Yes, it's antique, like its owner.</font>

322
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:58,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you have self-irony too.
That's fantastic.</font>

323
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where are you going?
I mean, in which direction?</font>

324
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:03,101
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, I'm going to Lund.</font>

325
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But that suits me perfectly.
You see, I'm on my way to Italy.</font>

326
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:08,621
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm honored.</font>

327
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My name's Sara.
Silly name, isn't it?</font>

328
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:14,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My name's Isak.
It's silly too.</font>

329
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:17,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Weren't they married?
- No, unfortunately.</font>

330
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:20,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That was Abraham and Sara.</font>

331
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:22,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's leave, then.</font>

332
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:25,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have another lady with me.
Here she comes.</font>

333
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:28,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Marianne, this is Sara.
- Hello.</font>

334
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:31,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We're going to have company
as far as Lund.</font>

335
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:35,181
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sara's off to Italy, but she's promised
to ride a ways with us.</font>

336
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:38,511
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ironic again, but it suits you.</font>

337
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:41,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's be off.</font>

338
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hey, guys, I've got a lift
almost to Italy.</font>

339
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:54,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's Anders and that's Viktor
and this is Father Isak.</font>

340
00:32:57,371 --> 00:33:01,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That peach you're gaping at
is Marianne.</font>

341
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,661
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What a big bus.</font>

342
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:08,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, there's room for us all.</font>

343
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:12,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Put your luggage in the trunk,
if you don't mind.</font>

344
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:31,611
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I must tell you, Isak,
that Anders and I are going steady.</font>

345
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We're crazy about each other.</font>

346
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:37,121
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Viktor's the chaperone.
Daddy insisted.</font>

347
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:42,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Viktor is in love with me too.</font>

348
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a brilliant move of Daddy's.</font>

349
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:50,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I may have to seduce Viktor
to get rid of him.</font>

350
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:55,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'd better tell you I'm a virgin.
That's why I'm so cheeky.</font>

351
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:57,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I smoke a pipe.</font>

352
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:02,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Viktor says it's good for you.
He's crazy about anything healthy.</font>

353
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:07,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was once in love
with a woman called Sara.</font>

354
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No! She was like me, wasn't she?</font>

355
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:12,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She was, actually.</font>

356
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What happened to her?</font>

357
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:18,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She married my brother Sigfrid
and had six children.</font>

358
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:22,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She's 75 now
and quite a beautiful old lady.</font>

359
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I can't think of anything worse
than growing old.</font>

360
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:31,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, dear,
now I <i>have</i> put my foot in it.</font>

361
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:09,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Wait.
Let me get my glasses - There.</font>

362
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you all right?</font>

363
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have no excuse.
It's all our fault.</font>

364
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My wife was driving.</font>

365
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:24,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you all right?
Completely all right?</font>

366
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:26,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank goodness for that.</font>

367
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:31,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The murderers must introduce
themselves! My name's Alman.</font>

368
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:35,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's my wife Berit.
You can see she has been an actress.</font>

369
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:38,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's the complication
we were discussing when -</font>

370
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:40,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come here, Berit,
and say you're sorry.</font>

371
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:44,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm so sorry.
It was all my fault.</font>

372
00:35:44,451 --> 00:35:48,731
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was just going to hit my husband
when that curve appeared.</font>

373
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:54,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">God punishes some people at once,
eh, you Catholic?</font>

374
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's get your car upright.</font>

375
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Oh, never mind us. Please.
- Shut up, Sten.</font>

376
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:04,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Some people are unselfish,
though <i>you</i> don't think so.</font>

377
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:11,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My wife is a little nervous.
We've had a shock.</font>

378
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:18,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Just look at him measuring
his strength with the youngsters,</font>

379
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:24,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">straining his flabby muscles
to show off in front of that cute girl.</font>

380
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:33,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Darling, you might have a stroke.</font>

381
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,971
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My wife likes ridiculing me.</font>

382
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:41,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I let her.
It's psychotherapy.</font>

383
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:49,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I never know whether my wife
is really crying or just playacting.</font>

384
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll be damned if it isn't real.</font>

385
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:57,921
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It happens when you catch
a glimpse of death.</font>

386
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:59,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can't you shut up?</font>

387
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:03,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My wife can really <i>live</i> a part.</font>

388
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:07,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">For two years,
she made me think she had cancer</font>

389
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and plagued us
with every possible symptom,</font>

390
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:14,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">even though the doctors
could find nothing wrong with her.</font>

391
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:19,711
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Eventually we believed her
more than the doctors!</font>

392
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:22,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's natural that you're upset,</font>

393
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but why not leave your wife
in peace for a while?</font>

394
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:27,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A woman has a right
to her tears, eh?</font>

395
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:30,921
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't get in the way
of a woman's tears.</font>

396
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:35,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You are beautiful,
but old Berit's a bit past her prime.</font>

397
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:38,041
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you can <i>afford</i> to defend her.</font>

398
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:41,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I sympathize with her.
For several reasons.</font>

399
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:44,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Very sarcastic!</font>

400
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yet you don't seem
in the least hysterical.</font>

401
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:50,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But little Berit is.</font>

402
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:53,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you know
what that means for me?</font>

403
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I gather you're a Catholic.</font>

404
00:38:55,651 --> 00:38:57,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Quite right.
That's how I stand it.</font>

405
00:38:57,871 --> 00:39:00,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We ridicule each other.</font>

406
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She has her hysteria.
I have my Catholicism.</font>

407
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:05,561
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So, you see, we need each other.</font>

408
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:09,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's only egoism
that we haven't killed each other.</font>

409
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:21,181
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There it came.</font>

410
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's what's called a syncope,
isn't it?</font>

411
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:29,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Very funny.</font>

412
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:36,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If I'd had a stopwatch,
I could have timed the explosion.</font>

413
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Shut up! Shut up!</font>

414
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:49,271
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This may be too blunt,</font>

415
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:54,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but for the children's sake,
will you please get out.</font>

416
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:06,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Forgive us, if you can.</font>

417
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:40,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>It was with mixed feelings
I saw this region again.</i></font>

418
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:44,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I had my first practice here,</i></font>

419
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:48,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>and my old mother lives nearby.</i></font>

420
00:40:58,971 --> 00:41:00,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hello there, Doctor.</font>

421
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:04,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you're in these parts again,
Doctor?</font>

422
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:08,061
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Shall I fill it up?
Pass me the key to the hood.</font>

423
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:13,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Eva! Come here a moment!</font>

424
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:18,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's Dr. Borg in person.</font>

425
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:23,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Mom and Dad and the whole countryside
still talk about him.</font>

426
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:26,531
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The world's best doctor.</font>

427
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:31,161
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let's call the baby after him.</font>

428
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:34,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Isak Akerman - not a bad name
for a prime minister.</font>

429
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:36,971
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Suppose it's a girl.</font>

430
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:40,101
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We only have boys.</font>

431
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:49,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And how's your father these days?</font>

432
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:53,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, Dad's getting a bit decrepit.</font>

433
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But Mom's as lively as a cricket.</font>

434
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:00,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you're going to see
<i>your</i> mother, Doctor?</font>

435
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:04,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She's amazing.
She must be at least 95.</font>

436
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Ninety-six.
- Imagine that.</font>

437
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Imagine that!</font>

438
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do I owe you?</font>

439
00:42:11,521 --> 00:42:14,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- This is on Eva and me!
- Absolutely not!</font>

440
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:18,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't insult us, Doctor.
We can do the proper thing too!</font>

441
00:42:18,821 --> 00:42:23,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why should you pay
for my gasoline?</font>

442
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:26,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There are things
that <i>can't</i> be paid back -</font>

443
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:28,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">not even with gas.</font>

444
00:42:28,981 --> 00:42:31,331
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We haven't forgotten.</font>

445
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:35,161
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ask anyone around here.</font>

446
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:38,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They all remember your kindness.</font>

447
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Maybe I should have stayed here.</font>

448
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:45,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What do you mean?</font>

449
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,611
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What? What did you say, Henrik?</font>

450
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:50,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You said you should have stayed.</font>

451
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:53,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did I?</font>

452
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, thanks anyway.</font>

453
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:02,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let me know when the new son arrives,
and I'll be the godfather.</font>

454
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:05,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know where to find me.</font>

455
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:25,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then I told the old bat
that I'm the district medical officer.</font>

456
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:30,321
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>During lunch I was in good spirits</i></font>

457
00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:35,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>and told the young people

458
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:38,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>My stories were quite a success,</i></font>

459

<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>and I don't think they laughed

00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:47,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I had wine with the lunch,

461
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:56,821
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ah, when creation shows
so much beauty,</font>

462
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:00,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">how radiant must be its source!</font>

463
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:03,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He is going to be a minister,

464
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:05,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Reciting poetry
is against our agreement</font>

465
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:10,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">not to discuss God
or science on this trip.</font>

466
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:11,331
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It was beautiful!</font>

467
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:15,841
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How can anyone today
study to become a minister!</font>

468
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:20,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Your rationalism is as dry as dust.</font>

469
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:22,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I say that modern man -</font>

475
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:41,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Religion for the people.
Opium for the aching limb.</font>

481
00:44:55,171 --> 00:45:00,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Whatever I said
would be met with tolerant irony,</font>

482

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Evald and I have no children.</font>

515
00:47:28,951 --> 00:47:34,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">These young people nowadays!
I bore ten children.</font>

516
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:41,511
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Will you please hand me
that big box over there.</font>

517
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,721
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">My mother lived in this house.</font>

518
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you remember
coming to see her, Isak?</font>

519
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Very well.</font>

520
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:56,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Here are some of your toys.</font>

521
00:47:56,691 --> 00:48:01,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have been trying to think
which of you owned what.</font>

522
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:04,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Ten children,
and all dead except Isak.</font>

523
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Twenty grandchildren.</font>

524
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:10,451
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Evald's the only one
who comes to see me.</font>

525
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:13,721
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't get me wrong -
I'm not complaining.</font>

526
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:17,731
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Fifteen great-grandchildren
whom I have never seen.</font>

527
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:23,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I send presents
for all their birthdays.</font>

528
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:29,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I get letters of thanks,
but nobody bothers to visit me</font>

529
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:32,521
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">unless they want to borrow money.</font>

530
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:36,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Oh, I know I'm tiresome.</font>

531
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:38,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't think that, Mother.</font>

532
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:41,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I've one more fault.</font>

533
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't die.</font>

534
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:47,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The inheritance
isn't being divided up</font>

535
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the way these crafty young people
had planned.</font>

536
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This was Sigbritt's doll.</font>

537
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:58,071
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She got it when she turned eight.</font>

538
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:01,081
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I made the dress myself.</font>

539
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But she never cared for it</font>

540
00:49:03,831 --> 00:49:05,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so it went to Charlotta.</font>

541
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:09,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She took care of it -
I remember it clearly.</font>

542
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:12,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you see who that is?</font>

543
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sigfrid was three
and you were five.</font>

544
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:20,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And myself.</font>

545
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What a fright
one looked in those days.</font>

546
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:25,561
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">May I have it?</font>

547
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">By all means.
It's only rubbish.</font>

548
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:30,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And here's a coloring book.</font>

549
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:36,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know whose it was.</font>

550
00:49:36,961 --> 00:49:39,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They've all put their names in it.</font>

551
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:42,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Kristina has scrawled,</font>

552
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:47,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"I love Papa more than
anything in the whole world."</font>

553
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:53,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And Birgitta has put,
"I'm going to marry Papa."</font>

554
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:59,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Isn't that funny?
I laughed when I saw it.</font>

555
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:04,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't you think it's cold in here?</font>

556
00:50:04,521 --> 00:50:06,711
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, not particularly.</font>

557
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:10,711
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have felt cold all my life.</font>

558
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:14,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Mostly my stomach.
I wonder why.</font>

559
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You have low blood pressure.</font>

560
00:50:17,031 --> 00:50:22,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let us have some tea,
and we can sit and talk.</font>

561
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:25,331
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, thank you, Mother.
We won't disturb you any longer.</font>

562
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:32,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sigbritt's eldest boy
will soon be 50.</font>

563
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:36,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I thought of giving him
Father's gold watch.</font>

564
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:40,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It has no hands.
Does that matter?</font>

565
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:53,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I remember when Sigbritt's boy
was a newborn.</font>

566
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:59,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He used to lie in the lilac arbor
at the summer house.</font>

567
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:02,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Now he's turning 50.</font>

568
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:09,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And little cousin Sara
used to carry him around and sing to him.</font>

569
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:12,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">She married Sigfrid,
that good-for-nothing.</font>

570
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:18,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, you must go now,
or you'll be late for the ceremony.</font>

571
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:23,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I am very glad you came,
and I hope to see you again.</font>

572
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:27,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Give my love to Evald.
Good-bye.</font>

573
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:56,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where are Anders and Viktor?</font>

574
00:51:56,901 --> 00:52:02,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They started arguing about God,
and then they lost their tempers.</font>

575
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:05,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And Anders tried
to twist Viktor's arm,</font>

576
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:09,841
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and Viktor said that was
a lousy argument for God's existence.</font>

577
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:14,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I said they could talk
about me instead.</font>

578
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:18,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then they told me to shut up
because I didn't understand the debate,</font>

579
00:52:18,731 --> 00:52:20,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so I left.</font>

580
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:24,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They went up the hill to fight it out
because each insisted...</font>

581
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:27,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">the other had hurt
his innermost feelings.</font>

582
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Where are they now?
- Up there.</font>

583
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't even try it.
Watch yourself.</font>

584
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:33,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Stop that!</font>

585
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:35,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll see to them.</font>

586
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:38,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Which one do <i>you</i> like best?</font>

587
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:40,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Which one do you like best?</font>

588
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:43,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know.
Anders is going to be a minister -</font>

589
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:46,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He's a darling.</font>

590
00:52:47,221 --> 00:52:49,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But a minister's wife -</font>

591
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:52,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Viktor's nice too.
In a different way.</font>

592
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Viktor will go far, of course.
- What do you mean?</font>

593
00:52:55,901 --> 00:53:01,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A doctor earns more money.
And ministers are out of date.</font>

594
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:05,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Though he has got nice legs
and a sweet neck.</font>

595
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:08,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But how <i>can</i> anyone believe in God?</font>

596
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:24,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well? Does God exist?</font>

597
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:53,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I dozed off,
but was haunted by vivid</i></font>

598
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:59,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>and humiliating dreams.</i></font>

599
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:06,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>There was something overpowering
in these dream images</i></font>

600
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:12,841
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>that bored relentlessly into my mind.</i></font>

601
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:25,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Have you looked in the mirror, Isak?</font>

602
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:30,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then I'll show you
what you look like.</font>

603
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:35,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're a worried old man
who's soon going to die,</font>

604
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:38,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but I have all my life before me.</font>

605
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:42,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That hurt your feelings, after all.</font>

606
00:54:43,461 --> 00:54:46,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, it didn't hurt.</font>

607
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:52,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, it hurt
because you can't bear the truth.</font>

608
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:56,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The truth is that
I've been too considerate.</font>

609
00:54:57,141 --> 00:54:59,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And so became unintentionally cruel.</font>

610
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I understand.</font>

611
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:08,511
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, you don't understand.
We don't speak the same language.</font>

612
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:11,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Look in the mirror again.</font>

613
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:13,591
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, don't turn away.</font>

614
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I see.</font>

615
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:18,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Listen to me.</font>

616
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:22,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm going to marry
your brother Sigfrid.</font>

617
00:55:23,451 --> 00:55:27,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Love is almost a game for us.</font>

618
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:33,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Look at your face now.
Try to smile!</font>

619
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There! Now you're smiling.</font>

620
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:41,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But it hurts so.</font>

621
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:46,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">As professor emeritus,
you ought to know why it hurts.</font>

622
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But you don't know.</font>

623
00:55:50,191 --> 00:55:54,181
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know so much,
and you don't know anything.</font>

624
00:55:56,201 --> 00:55:57,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I must go.</font>

625
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:01,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I promised to keep an eye
on Sigbritt's baby.</font>

626
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:32,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Poor little thing.</font>

627
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:35,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hush, baby. Sleep.</font>

628
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't be afraid of the wind</font>

629
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:44,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">or the birds</font>

630
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:48,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">or the waves of the sea.</font>

631
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:52,581
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm here with you,
holding you tight.</font>

632
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't be afraid, little one.</font>

633
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:58,721
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It will soon be day again.</font>

634
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No one will hurt you.</font>

635
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:05,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I am with you.
I am holding you.</font>

636
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:15,521
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Please come in, Professor Borg.</font>

637
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:24,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Please, have a seat.</font>

638
01:01:33,621 --> 01:01:35,721
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Have you brought
your examination book?</font>

639
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:37,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Sure.</font>

640
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:39,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Here it is.</font>

641
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:46,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Please identify the bacterial specimen
under the microscope.</font>

642
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There must be something wrong.</font>

643
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:06,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Not with the microscope.</font>

644
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:09,411

646
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What does it mean?</font>

647
01:02:31,451 --> 01:02:33,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know.</font>

648
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:37,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Really?
- I'm a doctor,...</font>

649
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:40,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">not a linguist.</font>

650
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:46,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What you see on the blackboard
is a doctor's first duty.</font>

651
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't you know what that is?</font>

652
01:02:53,691 --> 01:02:56,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Let me think.
- Take your time.</font>

653
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:03,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A doctor's first duty -</font>

654
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:05,611
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A doctor's -</font>

655
01:03:06,971 --> 01:03:08,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I've forgotten.</font>

656
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:12,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A doctor's first duty
is to ask for forgiveness.</font>

657
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:17,851
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Of course! Now I remember!</font>

658
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:32,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You have been accused of guilt.</font>

659
01:03:32,571 --> 01:03:34,841
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Accused of guilt?</font>

660
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:38,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll make a note that you haven't
understood the charge.</font>

661
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:43,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is it serious?</font>

662
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:46,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Unfortunately, Professor.</font>

663
01:03:58,391 --> 01:04:00,071
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have a weak heart.</font>

664
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:02,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm an old man.</font>

665
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:05,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You must be lenient with me.
It's only fair.</font>

666
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:08,421
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's nothing about your heart
In my papers.</font>

667
01:04:09,281 --> 01:04:12,781

- No, for God's sake, no!</font>

668
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:23,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Please diagnose the patient.</font>

669

<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The patient is dead.</font>

670
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What are you writing in my book?</font>

671
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:07,561
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- My verdict.
- And that is?</font>

672
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:09,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That you are incompetent.</font>

673
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:18,671
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You are also accused of some minor
but still serious offenses.</font>

674
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:23,321
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Callousness, selfishness,
ruthlessness.</font>

675
01:05:24,471 --> 01:05:27,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Your wife has made the charge.</font>

676
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:29,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'll be confronted with her.</font>

677
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:32,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But my wife has been dead for years!</font>

678
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:34,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you think I'm joking?</font>

679
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:39,121
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Please come with me.</font>

680
01:05:39,781 --> 01:05:41,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You have no choice.</font>

681
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:05,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Many forget a woman
who has been dead for 30 years.</font>

682
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:09,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Some cherish
a sweet and fading picture,</font>

683
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:15,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">but you can recall this scene
at any time.</font>

684
01:08:16,141 --> 01:08:19,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Tuesday, May 1st, 1917.</font>

685
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You stood on this very spot</font>

686
01:08:21,871 --> 01:08:26,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and heard and saw what that man
and woman said and did.</font>

687
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:45,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Now I'll go home and tell Isak.
I know just what he'll say.</font>

688
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:48,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"My poor girl, I'm sorry for you."</font>

689
01:08:51,181 --> 01:08:53,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Just as if he were God.</font>

690
01:08:55,161 --> 01:09:00,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then I'll weep and say,
"Do you really feel sorry for me?"</font>

691
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:05,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He'll say, "Yes, very sorry."</font>

692
01:09:06,611 --> 01:09:10,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then I'll weep even more
and ask him to forgive me.</font>

693
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He'll say,</font>

694
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:17,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">"You mustn't beg my forgiveness.
There is nothing to forgive."</font>

695
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:22,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But he doesn't mean
a word he says</font>

696
01:09:24,881 --> 01:09:27,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">because he's cold as ice.</font>

697
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:31,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And suddenly he gets very tender,</font>

698
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:36,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and I scream at him that he's mad</font>

699
01:09:37,531 --> 01:09:40,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and that his hypocrisy makes me sick.</font>

700
01:09:41,891 --> 01:09:44,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Then he says
he'll get me a sedative</font>

701
01:09:45,241 --> 01:09:48,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and that he understands
everything quite well.</font>

702
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:52,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I tell him it's his fault
that I am as I am.</font>

703
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:57,851
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And he looks sad
and says it <i>is </i>his fault.</font>

704
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:02,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But he doesn't really care
about anything</font>

705
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:05,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">because he's so cold.</font>

706
01:10:28,781 --> 01:10:30,451
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Where is she?</font>

707
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,621
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Gone. All are gone.</font>

708
01:10:35,111 --> 01:10:39,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Removed by an operation,
Professor.</font>

709
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:43,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A surgical masterpiece.
No pain.</font>

710
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:45,841
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nothing that bleeds or trembles.</font>

711
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:48,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">How silent it is.</font>

712
01:10:49,391 --> 01:10:52,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A perfect achievement
in its way, Professor.</font>

713
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:55,821
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- And the punishment?
- Punishment?</font>

714
01:10:56,201 --> 01:10:58,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know.
The usual, I suppose.</font>

715
01:10:58,811 --> 01:11:02,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- The usual?
- Yes. Loneliness.</font>

716
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:05,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Loneliness?
- Precisely.</font>

717
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:07,611
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Loneliness.</font>

718
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,321
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is there no mercy?</font>

719
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't ask me. I don't know.</font>

720
01:11:34,161 --> 01:11:35,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's this?</font>

721
01:11:36,471 --> 01:11:39,521
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The children wanted
to stretch their legs.</font>

722
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:41,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But it's still raining.</font>

723
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:46,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I told them about today
and they want to honor you.</font>

724
01:11:46,691 --> 01:11:49,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Oh, dear.
- Slept well?</font>

725
01:11:49,641 --> 01:11:55,331
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, but recently
I've had the weirdest dreams.</font>

726
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:59,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- It's comical.
- What's comical?</font>

727
01:12:00,161 --> 01:12:04,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">As if I must tell myself something
I won't listen to when I'm awake.</font>

728
01:12:04,671 --> 01:12:06,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's that?</font>

729
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:10,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That I'm dead.
Although I'm alive.</font>

730
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:14,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You and Evald are very alike.</font>

731
01:12:14,641 --> 01:12:16,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you've said.</font>

732
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:18,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He said the same thing.</font>

733
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:21,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">About me?</font>

734
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:22,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No. About himself.</font>

735
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:25,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But he's only 38.</font>

736
01:12:27,231 --> 01:12:29,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">May I tell you about it?</font>

737
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:33,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, I'd be grateful.</font>

738
01:12:35,421 --> 01:12:39,521
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A few months ago
I wanted to talk to Evald,</font>

739
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:41,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">so he drove me down to the sea.</font>

740
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:46,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It was raining then too.
He sat where you sit now.</font>

741
01:12:48,391 --> 01:12:52,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Well, you've trapped me.
What do you want to say?</font>

742
01:12:52,931 --> 01:12:54,971
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Something unpleasant, of course.</font>

743
01:12:56,301 --> 01:12:58,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I wish I didn't have to.</font>

744
01:12:58,471 --> 01:13:00,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You have found someone else.</font>

745
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:03,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't be childish.</font>

746
01:13:03,521 --> 01:13:08,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You tell me in funereal tones
that you must talk to me,</font>

747
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:11,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and then you find it
hard to begin.</font>

748
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:17,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Come on, for heaven's sake!
Don't keep me on tenterhooks!</font>

749
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:19,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I almost want to laugh now.</font>

750
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Whatever do you think
I'm going to tell you?</font>

751
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:25,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That I've killed someone,
or stolen the faculty funds?</font>

752
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm going to have a baby.</font>

753
01:13:30,851 --> 01:13:32,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you sure?</font>

754
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The doctor told me yesterday.</font>

755
01:13:34,841 --> 01:13:38,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So that was the secret.</font>

756
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:44,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I might as well tell you
that I intend to have this child.</font>

757
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:48,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- You've made up your mind?
- Yes, I have.</font>

758
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:06,901
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know I don't want a child.</font>

759
01:14:07,161 --> 01:14:09,661
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'll have to choose
between me and the child.</font>

760
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:12,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Poor Evald.
- Don't "poor Evald" me!</font>

761
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:15,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's absurd to live in this world,</font>

762
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:17,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and even more absurd
to provide it with new wretches.</font>

763
01:14:17,681 --> 01:14:20,121
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What's most absurd
is to think they'll have it better than us.</font>

764
01:14:20,271 --> 01:14:23,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- That's just an excuse.
- Call it what you want.</font>

765
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:28,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was an unwanted child
in a hellish marriage.</font>

766
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is he even sure I'm his son?</font>

767
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:35,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">That's no excuse
for behaving like this.</font>

768
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:37,011
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I must be at the hospital at 3:00.</font>

769
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:40,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have neither the time nor the desire
to discuss this any further.</font>

770
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:43,941
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You're a coward.</font>

771
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,131
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, coward.</font>

772
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:48,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">This life sickens me.</font>

773
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:50,321
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I will not be forced to take on</font>

774
01:14:50,511 --> 01:14:54,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">a responsibility that will make me live
for one day longer than I want to.</font>

775
01:14:54,451 --> 01:14:57,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And you know
that I mean what I say.</font>

776
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:12,151
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I know that this is wrong.</font>

777
01:15:12,431 --> 01:15:14,661
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">There's neither right nor wrong.</font>

778
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:18,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We act according to our needs.</font>

779
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:20,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And what are they?</font>

780
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:25,651
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yours is a hellish desire
to live and to create life.</font>

781
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:27,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And yours?</font>

782
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:31,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Mine is to be dead.
Stone-dead.</font>

783
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:48,481
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">If you want to smoke a cigarette,
I don't mind.</font>

784
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:55,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why have you told me all this?</font>

785
01:15:58,161 --> 01:16:04,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I saw you with your mother,
and I was panic-stricken.</font>

786
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:07,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't understand.</font>

787
01:16:09,711 --> 01:16:14,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I thought: That's his mother.</font>

788
01:16:15,021 --> 01:16:19,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">An old woman, cold as ice,</font>

789
01:16:20,261 --> 01:16:23,091
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">more forbidding than death.</font>

790
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:26,331
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And this is her son,</font>

791
01:16:27,231 --> 01:16:30,501
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and there are light-years
between them.</font>

792
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:34,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">He himself says
he's a living corpse.</font>

793
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:41,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And Evald is growing
just as lonely, cold and dead.</font>

794
01:16:43,341 --> 01:16:46,161
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And I thought of the baby inside me.</font>

795
01:16:47,221 --> 01:16:51,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">All along the line,
there's nothing but cold and death</font>

796
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:54,571
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and loneliness.</font>

797
01:16:55,471 --> 01:16:57,821
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It must end somewhere.</font>

798
01:16:58,991 --> 01:17:01,491
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But you're going back to Evald!</font>

799
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:06,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">To say I can't agree
to his conditions.</font>

800
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:10,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I want this child.
No one can take it from me.</font>

801
01:17:11,071 --> 01:17:13,791
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Not even the man
I love most of all.</font>

802
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:19,871
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Can I help you?
- No one can help me.</font>

803
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:24,661
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We are too old.
Things have gone too far.</font>

804
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:28,181
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What happened after your talk?</font>

805
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:31,291
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Nothing.
I left him the next day.</font>

806
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:33,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hasn't he got in touch with you?</font>

807
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:38,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I don't want us to get -</font>

808
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:41,681
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">To get what?</font>

809
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,721
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Like those two in the car today.</font>

810
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:49,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I was just thinking of them.</font>

811
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:53,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It reminded me of my own marriage.</font>

812
01:17:53,851 --> 01:17:55,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But we love each other.</font>

813
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,271

Long may he live</i></font>

01:17:58,501 --> 01:18:01,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>May he live to be
a hundred years old</i></font>

815
01:18:03,551 --> 01:18:06,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We heard you're celebrating
a grand occasion today.</font>

816
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:10,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">With these simple flowers
we want to say</font>

817
01:18:10,951 --> 01:18:15,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">that we are <i>very</i> impressed
that you've been a doctor for 50 years.</font>

818
01:18:15,641 --> 01:18:19,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We know you must be
a very wise old man</font>

819
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:22,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">who knows <i>everything</i> about life</font>

820
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:27,341
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">and has learned
all the instructions by heart.</font>

821
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:31,861
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you.</font>

822
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Now we must go on.
It's getting late.</font>

823
01:19:05,881 --> 01:19:10,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you did come.
Evald and I had given up hope.</font>

824
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:13,531
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">A nice drive is relaxing, isn't it?</font>

825
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:17,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You'll have to get
into your tails at once.</font>

826
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:21,561
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Good afternoon, Marianne.
I've told Evald you're coming.</font>

827
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:24,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you.
That was most kind.</font>

828
01:19:24,731 --> 01:19:26,991
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you came after all, Miss Agda.</font>

829
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:32,781
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I considered it my duty.
But my pleasure's been spoiled.</font>

830
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:35,121
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Welcome, Father.</font>

831
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">As you see,
I've brought Marianne with me.</font>

832
01:19:38,621 --> 01:19:41,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Hello, Marianne.
- May I put my things upstairs?</font>

833
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:44,201
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">The guest room as usual, Father?</font>

834
01:19:44,461 --> 01:19:46,211
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Let me take your bag.
It's rather heavy.</font>

835
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:48,401
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Go into the kitchen.
I'll be right there.</font>

836
01:19:48,631 --> 01:19:50,611
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You can put your things down there.</font>

837
01:19:50,881 --> 01:19:53,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, it was pleasant.</font>

838
01:19:53,681 --> 01:19:54,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Who are those young people?</font>

839
01:19:55,011 --> 01:19:57,221
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know. They're nice,
and they're off to Italy.</font>

840
01:19:57,471 --> 01:20:00,191
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- They seem nice.
- Yes, they're very nice.</font>

841
01:20:00,461 --> 01:20:03,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's a quarter past 4:00.</font>

842
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,241
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I've bought you new shoelaces.</font>

843
01:20:19,161 --> 01:20:21,351
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'm leaving tomorrow,
so don't worry.</font>

844
01:20:21,621 --> 01:20:23,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Are you going to a hotel?
- No, why?</font>

845
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:27,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Can't we share the bedroom
for one more night? Unless you object.</font>

846
01:20:28,151 --> 01:20:30,921
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Give me a hand unpacking?
- It's nice to see you.</font>

847
01:20:31,211 --> 01:20:32,911
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And unexpected.</font>

848
01:20:33,201 --> 01:20:34,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Same here.</font>

849
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:37,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are we going on
to the banquet afterwards?</font>

850
01:20:38,111 --> 01:20:42,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, I'll just call Stenberg
and tell him I'll have a lady with me.</font>

851
01:20:50,031 --> 01:20:52,831
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Hurry up, Professor!</font>

852
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:31,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>During the ceremony,</i></font>

853
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:36,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>my thoughts strayed
to the day's events,</i></font>

854
01:22:36,921 --> 01:22:40,931
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>and it was then I decided</i></font>

855
01:22:41,181 --> 01:22:43,971
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>to write down what had happened.</i></font>

856
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:50,171
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>In this jumble of events,</i></font>

857
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:54,471
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>I seemed to discern
an extraordinary logic.</i></font>

858
01:23:20,301 --> 01:23:22,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Did you enjoy the ceremony?</font>

859
01:23:23,511 --> 01:23:25,441
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, thank you.</font>

860
01:23:26,881 --> 01:23:28,421
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you tired, Miss Agda?</font>

861
01:23:28,651 --> 01:23:30,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I won't deny it.</font>

862
01:23:30,431 --> 01:23:32,251
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Take one of my sleeping pills.</font>

863
01:23:32,461 --> 01:23:34,141
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, thank you.</font>

864
01:23:35,121 --> 01:23:40,111
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Miss Agda,
I am sorry about this morning.</font>

865
01:23:40,611 --> 01:23:42,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you ill, Professor?</font>

866
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:44,411
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No. Why?</font>

867
01:23:44,701 --> 01:23:47,951
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't like the sound of it.</font>

868
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:51,361
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Is it so rare
for me to say I'm sorry?</font>

869
01:23:53,751 --> 01:23:55,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Do you want the carafe
on the table?</font>

870
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,961
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, thank you.</font>

871
01:24:04,011 --> 01:24:06,891
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I'll open the balcony doors. There.</font>

872
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:14,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's raining.</font>

873
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:24,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Thank you anyway, Professor.
Good night.</font>

874
01:24:24,951 --> 01:24:26,601
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Miss Agda,</font>

875
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:33,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">as we have known each other</font>

876
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,101
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">for so many years,</font>

877
01:24:35,341 --> 01:24:38,841
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">don't you think we could call
each other Agda and Isak?</font>

878
01:24:39,081 --> 01:24:41,631
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No, I don't.</font>

879
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:43,431
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Why not?</font>

880
01:24:43,591 --> 01:24:45,611
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Have you brushed your teeth,
Professor?</font>

881
01:24:47,311 --> 01:24:51,621
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">No intimacies for me, thank you.</font>

882
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:54,001
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's all right between us as it is.</font>

883
01:24:54,231 --> 01:24:56,701
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But we are old now.</font>

884
01:24:56,991 --> 01:25:01,811
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Speak for yourself.
A woman is jealous of her reputation.</font>

885
01:25:02,281 --> 01:25:06,531
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">What would people think if we
suddenly began to say Agda and Isak?</font>

886
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,881
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They would make fun of us.</font>

887
01:25:09,131 --> 01:25:11,981
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Are you always right?</font>

888
01:25:12,231 --> 01:25:14,181
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Almost always.</font>

889
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:19,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">At our age,
we should know how to behave.</font>

890
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:22,311
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Yes, good night, Miss Agda.</font>

891
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:30,731
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Good night, Professor.
I'll leave the door ajar.</font>

892
01:25:31,311 --> 01:25:34,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">You know where I am
if you want anything.</font>

893
01:25:45,571 --> 01:25:52,541
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Sunny children of air and light</i></font>

894
01:25:52,851 --> 01:26:00,621
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Oh, I understand your quiet murmur</i></font>

895
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:09,551
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Blooming beautiful valleys</i></font>

896
01:26:09,991 --> 01:26:17,761
<font face="sans-serif" size="71"><i>Home to your heart's peace</i></font>

897
01:26:20,521 --> 01:26:24,231
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Father Isak! You were splendid
in the procession.</font>

898
01:26:24,461 --> 01:26:26,381
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We were terribly proud
to know you.</font>

899
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:30,451
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">An old girl is giving us a lift
all the way to Hamburg.</font>

900
01:26:30,671 --> 01:26:33,451
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- Anders is mad about her.
- Oh, be quiet.</font>

901
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:35,461
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">We just wanted to say good-bye.</font>

902
01:26:35,711 --> 01:26:38,261
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Good-bye. And thank you
for your company.</font>

903
01:26:40,631 --> 01:26:42,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It's you I really love, you know.</font>

904
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:46,801
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Today, tomorrow, always.</font>

905

913
01:27:32,261 --> 01:27:34,641
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">So you're going to the dance?</font>

914
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:37,391
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I suppose so.</font>

915

918
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:52,691
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Evald, sit down a moment.</font>

919
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:57,291

between you and Marianne?</font>

921

922
01:28:07,361 --> 01:28:09,031
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I don't know.</font>

923
01:28:09,711 --> 01:28:12,021

924
01:28:14,311 --> 01:28:16,281
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">But wouldn't it -</font>

925
01:28:16,811 --> 01:28:18,771
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I have asked her to stay with me.</font>

926
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:21,051
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Shouldn't you - I mean -</font>

927
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:25,301
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">- I can't live without her.
- You mean alone?</font>

930
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:32,751
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">It will be as she wants.</font>

931
01:28:33,031 --> 01:28:35,741
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">And she -</font>

932
01:28:36,391 --> 01:28:39,541

933
01:28:40,411 --> 01:28:42,371
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">About that debt of yours -</font>

934
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:45,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">Don't worry,
you'll get your money.</font>

935

- Fine. Just fine.</font>

937
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:56,021
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">I lost a heel.
Will these shoes do?</font>

938
01:28:56,271 --> 01:28:58,511
<font face="sans-serif" size="71">They're very nice.</font>

939

00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:52,583
WOMAN

5
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,250
Yes?

6
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,542
Ah, Marianne!

7
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,500
It's nice to hear from you.

8
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,417
Yes.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,375
Yes, I'm working.

10
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,208
Yeah.

11
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,958
No, I have to work. Listen...

12
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,833
listen, I'll call you back.

13
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:57,792
Love you.

14
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,167
I'll call you back later.

15
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,083
Goodbye.

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,333
"All my life...

17
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,083
I've had two passions,

18
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,417
women

19
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,500
and liter--"

20
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:33,125
Yes?

21
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,083
An,  Hélène!

22
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,083
It's nice to hear from you.

23
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,500
No, I'm working.

24
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,542
Yes, I'm working.

25
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,792
No, I told you I'm working.

26
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,000
Listen, I'll call you later.

27
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,417
That's right. Goodbye.

28
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,417
Talk to you later. Love you.

29
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:53,542
Shit.

30
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,750
Dammit.

31
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,667
Hello?

32
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,125
Yes.

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,125
Put him through.

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,583
Yes, put him through.

35
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,708
Hello, listen, old boy,
I've helped you for the past 15 years.

36
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,500
We're nearly friends.

37
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,750
You're in a crisis.

38
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,333
I don't want you to crumble.

39
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,250
Listen to me,

40
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,833
I have here in front of me

41
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:21,958
the details of your situation

42
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,333
and the results.

43
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,125
-Do you want the details?
-No.

44
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,042
Fine, here are the results.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,875
I manage seven of your books.

46
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,292
For the latest one,
the royalties come to 7,100 new francs.

47
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,917
That's perfect. Send it to me.

48
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,875
The advances I gave you come to three...

49
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,000
330,000 new francs.

50
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,917
The difference is

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,708
231,000 new francs.

52
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,167
In other words,

53
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,458
you owe me 23,100,000 old francs.

54
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,958
Not only that,
but you suppose I'll pay your taxes.

55
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,875
And not only that,
you suppose I'll send more money.

56
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,375
There are limits, my friend.

57
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,583
What do you want exactly?

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,042
Jérôme, for three years

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,625
you haven't delivered a book.

60
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,042
That's the problem.

61
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,417
The problem results from another problem.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,792
My books are about women.

63
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,375
I can't write because
I can no longer stand women.

64
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,042
They've become an abomination,

65
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,417
a mistake of nature.

66
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,167
That's it.

67
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,125
That's it! That's great.

68
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,167
Write that for me.

69
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:29,542
Go to hell.

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,958
Yes?

71
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,083
Jerome...

72
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,958
I have an idea.

73
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,792
What if I found you a woman...

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,625
who doesn't weigh on you?

75
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,417
Who isn't a burden?

76
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,000
Who inspires you

77
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,167
without tying you down?

78
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,250
You just have to trust me.

79
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,125
-Let me do it.
-Really?

80
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,792
I'll take care of finding her,

81
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,875
and you get to work if I do find her.

82
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,875
So what do you say?

83
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,250
"Urgently seeking secretary.

84
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,833
Perfect shorthand, highly competent.

85
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,042
Pretty.

86
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,708
Open to all points of view.

87
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:39,458
For short-term travel with famous author.

88
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,667
High salary.

89
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,792
Apply at Rene Garanciére Publishing,

90
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,000
11 Servendoni Street."

91
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,292
Hello, miss.

92
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,417
You fit the criteria we're looking for.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,625
Please take a seat.

94
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,708
You read the ad carefully?

95
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:43,417
Yes, I have to travel

96
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,000
as the secretary of a famous writer.

97
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,625
High salary.

98
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,292
Yes, um...

99
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,458
There is a clause

100
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,625
that may surprise you.

101
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:00,917
It's not routine
for the publishing house to recruit

102
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,458
secretaries for our authors.

103
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,917
But Jerome Hervé

104
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,167
is the most famous.

105
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,917
We want to help him.

106
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,958
He's looking for a secretary

107
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,250
who is competent, which you are.

108
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,792
But there's an additional...

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,125
An artist...

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,292
needs inspiration...

111
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,583
understanding...

112
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:38,500
encouragement.

113
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,000
And that is why we're asking you...

114
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,375
Excuse me, miss.

115
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,167
Read clause number five for yourself.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,000
"Said secretary agrees
to collaborate at all times,

117
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,833
both day and night,

118
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:03,083
with collaboration not limited
to a professional context."

119
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,125
"She agrees to grant Jérôme Hervé
immediately upon his request

120
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,292
everything a woman can grant a man."

121
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,792
"Everything a woman can grant a man."

122
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,875
What does that mean?

123
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,792
I know full well what that means.

124
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,750
-It means you take me for a whore.
-Not at all, miss.

125
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,042
Understand that, like you,
I consider this clause--

126
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,125
It's despicable.

127
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,833
It's ridiculous.

128
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,375
I'll be a slave to a man
I've never seen before.

129
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:32,500
Do you think I'd be
a dirty old man's plaything?

130
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,542
I'm not that kind of girl.

131
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,083
So you decline the offer.

132
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,250
No, I accept.

133
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,875
JEROME HERVE
AVAILABILISM

134
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:36,000
On Track A, the Trans Europe Express
Mistral express train,

135
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,000
departing at 1:20 p.m. in first class.

136
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,167
Hello, Marianne?

137
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,125
I'm calling from the train station.

138
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:51,208
You know leaving for work
was the only solution, darling.

139
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,042
But you know I can only work
when I'm on the move.

140
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,333
Traveling inspires me.

141
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,875
What?

142
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,083
No, of course I'm going alone.

143
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,583
I can't wait for us to be married, either.

144
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,542
That's why I have to finish my book,

145
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,458
you see?

146
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,792
Yes.

147
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,167
Yes!

148
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,292
Listen, darling, my train is leaving.

149
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,917
Hugs and kisses.

150
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,125
Yes.

151
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,875
Listen, I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

152
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,875
Love you, bye.

153
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:40,417
On Track A, the Trans Europe Express
Mistral is about to depart.

154
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,708
Please board the train.

155
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,250
Hello, Hélène?

156
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:49,833
Darling,

157
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,667
I'm calling from the train station.

158
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,375
Yes.

159
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,708
No, not for long.

160
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:57,625
No.

161
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,375
I have to do some writing,

162
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,917
and I wanted to finish my book
before our wedding.

163
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,333
But you know I can only work
when I'm on the move.

164
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,583
Traveling inspires me.

165
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,833
Well, me, too, darling,
I can't wait to be married either.

166
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,708
Listen,

167
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:17,417
I'll call you back
because my train is leaving.

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,333
Love you.

169
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,750
See you-- goodbye.

170
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,458
Clara,

171
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,542
that's a pretty name.

172
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,708
Actually, maybe pretty
isn't the right word,

173
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,458
but it's a name that's--

174
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:14,500
Clear!

175
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,542
Yes.

176
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,208
It's funny how big the countryside is.

177
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,708
It's even too big, if you think about it.

178
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,625
I wonder why the countryside is so big.

179
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,500
That's a question I've never asked myself.

180
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,792
It's funny, I always ask
questions no one else does.

181
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,708
Why?

182
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,583
I wonder why.

183
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,917
-Because you're curious.
-Oh no.

184
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,917
-No?

185
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,458
For a woman, I'm not curious at all.

186
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,792
-Oh really?
-But I'm interested in everything.

187
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,833
I always want to know
how things will turn out.

188
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,625
Would you like a cigarette?

189
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,292
No thanks, I don't smoke.

190
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,667
But I'll still have one.

191
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,958
Usually, you can only smoke one.

192
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,250
That's true.

193
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,833
I wonder why.

194
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,792
I like to put two or three chocolates
in my mouth at the same time.

195
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,042
Luckily, I never eat them.

196
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,750
-Why?
-Because I hate it.

197
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,792
I hate anything sweet.

198
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,500
Except for cake, of course.

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,833
Forgive me for intruding.

200
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,708
Sir, if you could sign this menu for me,

201
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,208
I'll paste it in your book.

202
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,125
My pleasure.

203
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,667
-Here you are.
-I've read all your books.

204
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,833
Really?

205
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,292
Why do you write books?

206
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,417
Why shouldn't I write them?

207
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,792
Because there are
so many other things to do.

208
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,500
I knew a writer once.

209
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,542
Which one?

210
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,417
I forgot his name.

211
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,292
He was a great chess player.

212
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,792
Do you play chess?

213
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,875
Do I look like I play chess?

214
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,292
What's your sign?

215
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,000
Aries.

216
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,167
I should have known.

217
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,833
I'm a Libra.

218
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,375
Alcohol, liqueur?

219
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,667
No, thank you.

220
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,417
We'll have a drink while working.

221
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,417
I hope you don't mind getting to work.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,167
Did a woman give you that tie?

223
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,083
Yes.

224
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,375
Why?

225
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,083
Because it doesn't suit you.

226
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,292
Put The Women as the title.

227
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,042
Very good.

228
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,417
Start a new paragraph.

229
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,792
"How I got here."

230
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,667
Type!

231
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,542
It's the title of the first chapter.

232
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:29,500
"How I got here."

233
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,458
"Next week, I'm marrying
Marianne in St. Moritz

234
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,000
and Hélène in Venice."

235
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:36,958
Period, new line.

236
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,542
You or your character?

237
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,583
Me.

238
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,500
Is that true?

239
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,292
Yes.

240
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,458
How funny.

241
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,583
"For 15 years, I've written
only about women,

242
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,333
and I'm interested in only them."

243
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,167
I've always dreamed of seeing up close
a man who never loved.

244
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,583
Right.

245
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,083
It's precisely because I loved
that I was loved...

246
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,333
and that I wrote my first book.

247
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,083
My first book was inspired
by a broken heart,

248
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,167
a break-up

249
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,333
that I didn't intend.

250
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,625
The first woman who mattered in my life

251
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,708
was named Anne.

252
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,625
We liked the same things,

253
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,958
including freedom,

254
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,542
which is so rare.

255
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,417
We were happy...

256
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,542
because we had the same tastes,

257
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,958
the same education,

258
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,458
the same desires.

259
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:38,708
In short,

260
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,625
we got along swimmingly.

261
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,208
We never left each other.

262
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,167
And yet, we were as free as the first day.

263
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,583
Everything was perfect between us.

264
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,958
Never a moment of boredom.

265
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,833
We also loved to talk,

266
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,292
to make love,

267
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,542
and to be silent.

268
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,250
It was--

269
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,167
Happiness?

270
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,250
"At any rate, it looked like happiness.”
Period, new line.

271
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,333
How long did it last?

272
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,750
It lasted...

273
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,750
Five years.

274
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,792
What's five years?

275
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,167
Us.

276
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,250
Listen...

277
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,708
you're leaving to Cuba for your report.

278
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,042
I'm going to San Francisco for my exhibit.

279
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,167
The Azores are on the way.

280
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,333
It'd be fun to get married there,
while we're at it.

281
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,167
You want to get married?

282
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:47,750
You?

283
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,333
Do you want...

284
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,625
do you really want to get married?

285
00:17:59,083 --> 00:17:59,917
To you,

286
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,458
on an island

287
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,167
for kicks.

288
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,125
Well, we can go to an island
without getting married.

289
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,292
If you don't want
to get married on an island,

290
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,833
we can do it somewhere else.

291
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,250
In our neighborhood.

292
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:22,125
I told her yes,

293
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,833
and I went to hide in a bistro.

294
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:27,375
I spent my life in the bistro...

295
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,542
writing like a madman
the things I didn't dare say.

296
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,292
I wrote that thanks to her,
I discovered something about myself.

297
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:42,292
I love you, we're happy,

298
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,333
but I just discovered what I prefer.

299
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,583
And I prefer pleasure
and adventure to happiness.

300
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,583
I prefer freedom to happiness,
spontaneity, you see?

301
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,458
The closer the marriage date got,

302
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,708
the more unsent letters I wrote.

303
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,292
I decided to write her a new letter.

304
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,125
It turned out very well.

305
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,500
I wrote that we would ruin everything,

306
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,583
that we should absolutely not marry.

307
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,750
That letter also stayed in my pocket.

308
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,625
Jérôme Hervé,

309
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:29,292
do you take Anne de Monfort
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

310
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,500
It's...

311
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,292
it's very difficult
to answer such a question

312
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,333
with a yes or no, at least for me.

313
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,958
No, you have to answer "yes."

314
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,375
That's it, that's the law.

315
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,958
Jerome Hervé, do you take
as your lawfully wedded wife

316
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,333
Miss Anne de Montfort?

317
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,042
No.

318
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,167
It isn't...

319
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,583
I'm really not marriage material.

320
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:05,917
You understand?

321
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,875
No, you don't understand.

322
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,000
You understand, right?

323
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,958
Here, you need to understand.

324
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,208
Read these letters.

325
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,875
You'll understand everything.

326
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,000
I didn't think we had split up.

327
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,083
I thought she would reply.

328
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,250
I anxiously awaited
her answer to my letters.

329
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,875
She sent them back to me
with just two words,

330
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,250
"Publish them."

331
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,625
She was perfect until the very end.

332
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I would never have thought of it alone.

333
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,250
Those letters made me famous.

334
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,250
And it was your first essay,

335
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,667
Availabilism.

336
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,750
You've read it?

337
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,583
"In love,

338
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,958
only beginnings are enjoyable."

339
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,083
"And that's why we must start over often."

340
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:18,292
"Availabilism" is the desire
to keep one's future intact

341
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,583
by never forming bonds.

342
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,375
-A singular being.
-That's right, a singular being.

343
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,458
I just bought it. I haven't read it.

344
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,375
Oh really?

345
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,250
I flipped through.

346
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,375
This isn't bad.

347
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,208
"We must always prefer the unknown

348
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,125
to what we've already experienced,

349
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,417
even if what we have is enjoyable."

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,958
"Man's greatest misfortune

351
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,583
is his ability to imagine
thousands of lives

352
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,000
while imprisoned in one body."

353
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,125
"It amplifies this misfortune

354
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,708
if we become prisoner to another being."

355
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,458
"In contrast, alleviating it

356
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,542
means preserving

357
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,333
the greatest number of possible choices."”

358
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,458
Yes. Do you like it?

359
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:05,500
I think if I were a man,
I would reason like that.

360
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,083
If I were a woman, too.

361
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,750
What are you?

362
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,500
I wish I knew.

363
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,458
I never talk about myself.

364
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,292
I am me.

365
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:20,542
Are you done questioning me?

366
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,333
You're the one
writing your memoirs, not me.

367
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,667
Next chapter.

368
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,292
Quote, "One Lost, Ten Found."

369
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,875
"Ten found."

370
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,625
Well, was it fun?

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,625
What was amazing
was that they were all different.

372
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,333
Otherwise, I would have stopped.

373
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,917
I was reborn with each one.

374
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,458
Life began again, everything began again

375
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,500
because no two were alike.

376
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,083
The lives I led were
all the more delightful

377
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,333
since I knew
I didn't have to stay until the end.

378
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:27,000
Few women could resist
my fascination for them.

379
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,208
I was fascinated

380
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,042
every time.

381
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,000
I always used the same words to attack.

382
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,375
"There are two women in you."

383
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,458
It always did the trick.

384
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,875
"Miss, there are two women in you."

385
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,375
"There are two women in you."

386
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,708
"There are two women in you."

387
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,458
"There are two women in you."

388
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,500
But you had a lot more than ten.

389
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,708
-Of course.
-How many?

390
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,750
I don't know.

391
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,833
Do you know your number?

392
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:06,875
How many?

393
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,583
Three.

394
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,875
You think I believe that?

395
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,375
Only three?

396
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,000
Those are the only ones that mattered.

397
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,542
I forgot about the others.

398
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,292
It's as if nothing ever happened.

399
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,250
Well, as for me...

400
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,833
that number is zero.

401
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:32,000
One day, something
extraordinary happened, an event.

402
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,375
A smile.

403
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,750
It was Bastille Day.

404
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,000
I was very happy, I liked her.

405
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,958
I liked her from the back
and from the front.

406
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:47,125
And she smiled at me.

407
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,333
I was... a happy man.

408
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,042
It's funny.

409
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,750
I feel like there are two women in you.

410
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,250
She smiled.

411
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:03,333
She smiled her dreadful smile.

412
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,583
I wondered if she smiled
because she had heard it before.

413
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,417
Yes, she had heard it before.

414
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,042
I asked her from whom. She said me.

415
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,792
Oh my God, I remembered.

416
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:21,375
Six months earlier in Florence,

417
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,750
I was crazy for this girl,
and I had forgotten.

418
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:33,500
How...

419
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,583
how could I tolerate a life

420
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:42,083
where no memory left its mark
because there were too many?

421
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,250
How could I have forgotten Florence?

422
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,667
If I couldn't recognize
a woman I had loved,

423
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,625
with whom I was infatuated,

424
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:59,500
my life was absurd...

425
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,542
and I had to change fast.

426
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,833
Come in.

427
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,917
Good evening, may I turn down your beds?

428
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,458
Yes, please.

429
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:19,917
Come.

430
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,917
Come into the hall
while he makes the beds.

431
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,750
The train is about to depart.

432
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,667
Thank you, Clara. I needed you.

433
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,458
No, you needed a secretary.

434
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,167
I needed to be with a woman
who didn't captivate me.

435
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,208
It's refreshing.

436
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,042
Thanks to our contract,
we've avoided whatever ruins love.

437
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,500
No, we're done for tonight.

438
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,083
Go get undressed.

439
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,000
Just like that?

440
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,583
Of course.

441
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,958
I'm getting undressed, too.

442
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:37,875
Which do you prefer?

443
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,917
Which what?

444
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,208
Which bed.

445
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,792
The one on the right or left?

446
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,750
We're going to sleep?

447
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:46,667
Yes.

448
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,875
Men are funny.

449
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,125
Who was the guy with you at the station?

450
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,042
Are you in love with him?

451
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:19,958
Madly.

452
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,583
Is he?

453
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,250
We'll have to see.

454
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:33,875
Is he jealous?

455
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,458
We'll have to see.

456
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,167
It's not that I'm tired,
but I like smoking in the dark.

457
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,375
In the dark, I can't taste the tobacco.

458
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,208
I hate the taste of tobacco.

459
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,917
So why do you smoke?

460
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,208
Because I can't live without it.

461
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,833
Clara?

462
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:23,958
Yes?

463
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:25,667
Come.

464
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:28,750
Where?

465
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,583
To my bed.

466
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:34,667
To do what?

467
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,500
Make love.

468
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,500
No, we said we were sleeping.

469
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:44,583
I changed my mind.

470
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,708
Why?

471
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:50,458
For God's sake, Clara!

472
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:51,750
You signed a contract.

473
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:28,625
Hey!

474
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,083
My contract
doesn't require me to want you,

475
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,708
only to put up with you.

476
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:36,875
Let's go.

477
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,292
Go to bed.

478
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,375
I'm better off on my own.

479
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,167
So now,

480
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,333
the contract isn't enough.

481
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,167
I have to be in love with you too.

482
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,250
Go to sleep.

483
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,583
We'll both be better off.

484
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:19,792
Oh, pardon me.

485
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,417
What are you doing here?

486
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,792
Forgive me, I have the wrong room.

487
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,917
That's quite all right.

488
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,208
See you later.

489
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,875
Okay, I'm ready.

490
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,833
To type.

491
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,458
Being a secretary is also in my contract.

492
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,917
Where were we?

493
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:15,792
You're not happy.

494
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,250
You're disappointed?

495
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:25,583
I'll make up for it
by being a good little secretary.

496
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,500
Do you want to know where we were?

497
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,417
Yes.

498
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:33,792
"I'm suspicious of too great a success
because it risks tying one down,

499
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,708
especially a man of my nature

500
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,167
who practices Don Juanism

501
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,667
without being a true Don Juan.”

502
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,500
Type.

503
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:48,542
"I was vulnerable...

504
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:55,292
because it pained me
to deny myself certain deep pleasures,

505
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:59,500
namely the limits
of knowing another being...

506
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:02,958
and the depths of tenderness."

507
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,500
"As a result of my conquests,
I desired love."

508
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,875
"This desire terrified me."

509
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:13,958
What was left?

510
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,500
Bodies.

511
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,333
Nothing but bodies.

512
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,250
I met this one

513
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,833
in the studio of a photographer
for whom she was posing.

514
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,125
It was perfect.

515
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,208
I was immediately reassured.

516
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:40,708
Our relationship
would be entirely physical.

517
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:43,750
The only problem was knowing
if I would tire of her.

518
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,083
The only problem was knowing

519
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:50,750
if my desire would outweigh my boredom.

520
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,125
I had to find out right away,

521
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,583
so I invited the body to lunch.

522
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:02,042
Take your fork like this,
then you insert it like a knife.

523
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:02,958
Like this.

524
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,167
Like that.

525
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,083
And you eat it.

526
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,042
It's delicious.

527
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,625
I didn't know oysters had feet.

528
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,167
Yes, they do.

529
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,792
Give it a try.

530
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,083
Good job.

531
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:25,125
What would you say
to a weekend trip to the countryside?

532
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:26,708
Just you and me.

533
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,792
-It's a great idea.
-Yes.

534
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:31,500
Yes.

535
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,708
"Beautiful women..."

536
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,667
Yes?

537
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,375
"Beautiful women are easier than others."

538
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,000
Easier than others?

539
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:46,125
Why?

540
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:51,292
As a result of constant solicitation,
their resistance has weakened.

541
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,500
It's true.

542
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,792
Yes, it's true.

543
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,708
"Marianne...

544
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,292
Marianne was a creature...

545
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,542
seduced by her own character."

546
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,292
And I was seduced only by her body,

547
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,750
which was absolutely reassuring.

548
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:25,500
A body is like an Old Master's painting.

549
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,417
Its value is certain.

550
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:28,917
I wanted her...

551
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,750
and she seemed to want me.

552
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,542
Basically,

553
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,333
it happened naturally,

554
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,333
like all important things.

555
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:52,167
I wanted to exhaust all the pleasure
this woman could give me.

556
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,542
And since the pleasure didn't run dry,

557
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,708
we left.

558
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,458
I thought we would leave for a few days,

559
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,375
but after a week,

560
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,375
we were in no hurry to end our trip.

561
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,583
All of France was ours.

562
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:21,167
Every landscape became a bedroom.

563
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:34,958
We made love every three miles,

564
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,167
80 times on average.

565
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:38,708
That's not bad.

566
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,500
It was fascinating

567
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,375
because every day

568
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,083
we prepared to leave.

569
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,292
Every day, we said that's enough.

570
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,542
Let's go back to Paris.

571
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,917
Then we didn't go back.

572
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Summer passed by imperceptibly,

573
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,167
from farewell to farewell,

574
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,042
reunion to reunion.

575
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:07,500
Without knowing it,

576
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:09,792
whereas we had only left for a weekend,

577
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,708
we were spending
the whole summer together.

578
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:27,542
We thought every day
was our last together...

579
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,417
that we would leave each other.

580
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,292
It was over

581
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,583
and hadn't mattered at all,

582
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,042
but I was crazy about her.

583
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,917
What did you like about her?

584
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:51,708
I thought I had figured her out
and deep down there was nothing there

585
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,500
but an abyss of femininity.

586
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,542
She was an expert
in the art of silent thought.

587
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,875
Who was she thinking about?

588
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,792
We hid everything from one another.

589
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,250
Starting with me,
who carefully hid my happiness.

590
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:34,500
That day,

591
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,958
I was enraged...

592
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,167
because it was impossible
to get a word out of her.

593
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,917
She was merely a woman
whose excesses captivated me

594
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,417
and who should be treated as a woman.

595
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,833
Like that.

596
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,500
I had loved solitude.

597
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,500
I could no longer stand it.

598
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,792
Marianne reduced me to thinking

599
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,458
any pleasure without her was incomplete.

600
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,208
I wondered if it was mutual,

601
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,625
if she was dreaming of someone else...

602
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,750
the bullfighter in the arena, for example,

603
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,667
which she never admitted.

604
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,375
On that day specifically,

605
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,292
she chose the moment
the bull was about to die

606
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,875
to tell me...

607
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,375
"You know, ever since I met you,

608
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:30,542
it's the first time I've liked a man."

609
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,625
It was both a declaration

610
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,208
and a threat.

611
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:41,000
The sea

612
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:42,667
with her.

613
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,500
And the fear of it ending.

614
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:58,542
We're good, very good.

615
00:42:58,625 --> 00:42:59,917
Yes, good.

616
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,333
It was the first time we said it.

617
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,083
There's a difference
between being happy and knowing it.

618
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,417
We knew it.

619
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,042
And my fear changed...

620
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,292
became clear.

621
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:18,917
My fear was,

622
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:21,042
"She's going to leave.”

623
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,792
I asked her, "You won't leave?"

624
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,708
If you want, I'll stay with you...

625
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:31,833
forever.

626
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,792
I remained silent, then I refused.

627
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:40,708
I had to refuse.

628
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,667
She was offering total happiness.

629
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,292
I refused because I wanted
to split up at the peak of happiness.

630
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:54,792
We were at the height of passion.

631
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:58,417
Yes, I let her go to Sweden.

632
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,917
Did she know I was leaving
out of an excess of love?

633
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,208
That I wanted to save our love

634
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,792
by protecting it from the slow decline
that awaits all couples?

635
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:09,375
I don't know.

636
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:13,458
I knew by splitting up,
we were saving one another.

637
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:14,500
It had to be done.

638
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,833
I did it.

639
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:18,667
There you go.

640
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,875
I got a novel out of it...

641
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:28,875
The Summer.

642
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,625
It was the summer with Marianne,

643
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,750
and it was also what had been.

644
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:41,792
It's very lovely.

645
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,500
I'm very sensitive to beauty.

646
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,250
Too sensitive.

647
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,958
I can't look at it for long
because it bores me.

648
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,042
Does he interest you?

649
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,000
He's cute with his moustache.

650
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,708
It's not that I fancy
men with moustaches, but...

651
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,083
I like them.

652
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,542
And last night you showed me
you don't like me.

653
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:23,167
-Are we working right away?
-No.

654
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,667
-Fine, I'll walk around.
-Go ahead.

655
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:41,542
Do you have The Summer by Jérôme Hervé?

656
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,333
The Summerby Jerome Hervé...

657
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,208
Here you go.

658
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,667
You're not going to read that?

659
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,042
It will bore you to tears.

660
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,542
Do you really feel like reading?

661
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,375
Wouldn't you rather talk?

662
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,208
The bill, please.

663
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:59,417
That's enough! I'll break your--

664
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,583
You little--

665
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:14,667
Bastard!

666
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:13,958
Be a dear and give this back
to the hairdresser.

667
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,167
Get undressed right now.

668
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,000
Do you only want me
because other men do?

669
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,458
-Be quiet!
-I have to be quiet?

670
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:27,000
-Yes!
-I'm sorry, I didn't know.

671
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,042
Do you want me... with or without shoes?

672
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:36,125
Trying to deter me is a waste of time.

673
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,000
Is it for me or the contract?

674
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,500
Do you want to rip it up?

675
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,333
You can't speak to me that way.

676
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,167
Okay, let's get to work.

677
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:07,417
Remember you're my secretary.

678
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:09,917
Here.

679
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:14,708
I'll try to be a good secretary,

680
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:18,417
for want of being a good...

681
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,833
a good...

682
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,167
How should I put it?

683
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,708
You tried to ruin everything.

684
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:26,083
I stuck to the contract.

685
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:28,333
-You spoiled your pleasure, not mine.
-Good.

686
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,125
I'm ready.

687
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:38,875
Fine.

688
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:40,583
Type, it's all you're good for.

689
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,000
If you want me to type,
you have to dictate.

690
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:44,750
Right.

691
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,750
Where were we?

692
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,083
We finished with Marianne.

693
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:51,292
You avoided the danger
of a woman who was good enough.

694
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,917
"And who I never forgot," period.

695
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:02,208
The sight of all women disgusted me
as long as they weren't Marianne.

696
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,500
And if I looked at Hélène, seen here,

697
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:08,250
it's because she was unlike a woman.

698
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,917
She was a parachute and ski champion.

699
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:16,375
She was the fastest, tallest,
most underground woman in the world.

700
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,500
She had done it all
and wanted to do it all.

701
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:22,208
She excelled in everything,
she loved danger.

702
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,333
She wanted to conquer, not please.

703
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,583
Her rule of thumb was self-defense.

704
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,333
Modesty was her passion.

705
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,625
There was no doubt regarding her ability

706
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,000
to avoid the male gaze.

707
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,875
I didn't forget Marianne,
but I thought of Hélène as sport.

708
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,625
Conquering the victor, subduing her...

709
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:50,833
became my goal,

710
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,875
a serious goal.

711
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,542
I loved waging war against her.

712
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,167
I wanted to win.

713
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,958
This war of patience,
which I had never fought before,

714
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,792
gave me a reason for living,

715
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:06,542
for getting up in the morning...

716
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:09,792
and shaving.

717
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,333
I followed her everywhere,
even to the most boring places.

718
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,292
Helene was charmed
by my interest in her passions.

719
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,625
But I started growing impatient.

720
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,333
It was the first time

721
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,542
I had devoted months to a woman

722
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,750
without making a single move.

723
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,333
It was the first time
I needed so much effort,

724
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,917
cunning and patience to seduce a girl.

725
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:45,958
And she refused.

726
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:59,458
I always deny you everything.

727
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:02,958
Maybe because you ask me for everything.

728
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,542
Maybe.

729
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:14,875
Now you're not asking me anything.

730
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:19,333
I'm asking for it to continue.

731
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:28,167
Let's go to my place.

732
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,375
Take the first left, please.

733
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,417
Ask me anything.

734
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:45,875
Anything.

735
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:52,208
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll arrive in Rome in a few minutes.

736
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,083
Thank you.

737
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:07,250
So Hélène...

738
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,125
An, Hélène.

739
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,000
I kept on with Hélène
because of her modesty.

740
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,417
She kindly lent herself to me
but never fully gave herself.

741
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:18,917
She found a way to stay...

742
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,375
more virginal than life.

743
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,167
It was unbearable.

744
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:48,875
I wanted to know
how far I could go with her.

745
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,167
Oh no, be quiet, please.

746
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,500
Sometimes I don't like you.

747
00:55:58,417 --> 00:55:59,250
Really.

748
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:09,625
I would have given up

749
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:12,250
if I hadn't felt her
hesitating, trembling...

750
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:14,375
her love for me.

751
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,333
I asked her
for resounding proof of her love.

752
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,292
That's what I wanted, resounding proof.

753
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:25,417
What better proof than acting
against your own nature?

754
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,542
Accepting the unacceptable?

755
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,750
I told her my demands.

756
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,167
Impulsively, she said yes.

757
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:34,500
I demanded the worst thing
she could think of.

758
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:42,583
It's this way.

759
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,375
No!

760
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:49,375
Don't start again!

761
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,292
Shut your mouth and come on!

762
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,917
Come, you'll see, it's very easy.

763
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,583
No, not that!

764
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,250
You promised me.

765
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,042
You said yes.

766
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,750
You gave your word.

767
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:09,250
You're not a little girl
who goes back on her word.

768
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,125
-No! Listen--
-Do it for me.

769
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:12,792
I'm asking you to do it for me.

770
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:14,375
We're here.

771
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:16,292
Come on.

772
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,292
Let me go, I don't want to.

773
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:20,792
It's an order.

774
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,083
Go on.

775
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,083
Come, we're here.

776
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:25,208
Go on.

777
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,625
Are you the new girl?

778
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,292
What are you waiting for?

779
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:15,792
That's it, you're obeying.

780
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:26,417
You are tolerating
what is contrary to your nature.

781
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:31,875
You couldn't even stand
my gaze without rebelling...

782
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:34,750
the gaze of the man you love.

783
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:40,375
You are under everyone's gaze.

784
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,375
I was overwhelmed with emotion...

785
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:51,500
with pleasure in Hélène's defeat.

786
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,917
I wondered if
she withstood it out of love.

787
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,958
I wondered if she took
as much pleasure as I did in her shame.

788
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:15,625
In other words, I thought only of her.

789
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:20,792
It was perhaps the first time
that I thought only of her.

790
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:24,208
I was crazy.

791
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:27,208
I was crazy with pleasure.

792
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:09,708
Helene, marry me.

793
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,208
You're irritating me with your women.

794
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,667
I wish you were unhappy.

795
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,500
-I am unhappy.
-No, you're not.

796
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,208
You're annoyed.

797
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:45,458
I want you to be sick.

798
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:47,625
In the jungle...

799
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,583
covered with flies.

800
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:51,542
I'd shoo them away.

801
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:53,958
But it's not possible.

802
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,792
I can't stand the heat,

803
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:57,500
except for in winter, of course.

804
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,458
You fascinate me, Clara.

805
01:01:03,083 --> 01:01:03,917
Shut up.

806
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,792
So are you going to marry
Marianne or Hélène?

807
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,417
Tell me how you found Marianne again.

808
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:22,833
Once Hélène submitted, did she bore you?

809
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,292
On the contrary, she inflamed me.

810
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,333
The next day, we left on a trip together.

811
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:31,542
And you found Marianne again.

812
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,125
Yes.

813
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:48,375
What does it mean that
we found each other here?

814
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:52,042
Surely, it means something.

815
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,458
It means we shouldn't leave
each other again.

816
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:02,042
Really,

817
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,542
it's extraordinary
that you're not married at your age.

818
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,333
Oh...

819
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,500
at my age.

820
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,417
I'm not the only one.

821
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,583
I'm not marriage material.

822
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,792
Yes, you said so yourself.

823
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,542
Does marriage disgust you?

824
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,708
No, I--

825
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:37,167
You think the best relationships
are the most casual.

826
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,083
Yes.

827
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,167
Yeah.

828
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:42,125
You're probably right.

829
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,708
Do you know why they're casual?

830
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:46,125
No.

831
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:48,042
Because they're open.

832
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:48,958
Yes.

833
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,625
I think it's Panther Two.

834
01:02:58,167 --> 01:02:59,208
What's Panther Two?

835
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:01,958
His boat is named Panther Two.

836
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:03,542
Whose boat?

837
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:05,167
Bob's boat.

838
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:07,167
He loves me.

839
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:10,667
He's been waiting for me for a week.

840
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,625
Poor thing.

841
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,583
What?

842
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:19,417
Go on, goodbye.

843
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:21,958
See you soon.

844
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:24,542
We'll talk on the phone.

845
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,917
Come on, don't be dumb.

846
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:33,417
I'm not dumb.

847
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,333
I'm free.

848
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,708
Like you, like him.

849
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:40,958
You don't want to marry me.

850
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,042
Neither does he.

851
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,667
He's like you.

852
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:46,917
He wants to love me.

853
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,625
What a good idea.

854
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,458
-I forbid you--
-You have no right.

855
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:53,708
Ow!

856
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:56,792
Be sensible.

857
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:04,083
Don't just stand there, you look foolish.

858
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:07,292
And I don't like you to look foolish.

859
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,083
My love.

860
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,542
You have suffered.

861
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,083
I like that.

862
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:30,000
What about Marianne?

863
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,333
How did you end up
wanting to marry her after that?

864
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:38,542
First, I had my fill
of Hélène and her wedding,

865
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,250
so I managed to postpone it.

866
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,167
I was resigned.

867
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:45,292
But I managed to postpone the date
and move the location.

868
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:49,292
I was like a prisoner in his cell
who is no longer tormented

869
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,083
and says, "That's the way it is."

870
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,500
Put yourself in a prisoner's shoes.

871
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,500
He's used to a certain routine,

872
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,083
then suddenly...

873
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,417
something happens, an unexpected event.

874
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,667
Not necessarily something
that sets him free

875
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,917
or leads to his pardon or escape.

876
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:07,667
Something...

877
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,375
a noise...

878
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:11,250
a smell...

879
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,167
an event.

880
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,417
For a prisoner, that event

881
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,333
gives him hope.

882
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,167
And that event for me

883
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,208
was Marianne's phone call.

884
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,333
It jolted me awake.

885
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:25,458
She was in Megéve.

886
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,000
She wanted to see me.

887
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,333
She had to see me.

888
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,750
Naturally, she didn't say why.

889
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,750
Marianne never says why.

890
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:38,542
I imagined her.

891
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,458
I saw her.

892
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:43,083
I heard her voice and saw her body.

893
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,667
No other woman could inflame
my imagination like her.

894
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,583
I wanted to be near her.

895
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,750
I was as impatient as she was.

896
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:58,167
I imagined her hanging up the phone,

897
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:02,667
and I leapt towards her body...

898
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:07,750
her body that I could never forget

899
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,250
because her soul...

900
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:13,792
was a mystery to me.

901
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:19,042
The mere memory of Marianne's body...

902
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,417
was enough to drive me insane.

903
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,292
I felt elation in her presence.

904
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,875
The idea of seeing her made me feel...

905
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:33,667
the promise of happiness,

906
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,958
which I hadn't known before meeting her.

907
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:40,792
She made me more intense.

908
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,000
I was beside myself.

909
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,542
-You're ridiculous.
-Not at all.

910
01:07:17,625 --> 01:07:20,167
He's the first man
who makes me want to be faithful.

911
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,958
Really? Well...

912
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:23,792
Perfect.

913
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,750
It was that good
on the boat in St. Tropez?

914
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:28,292
Tell me.

915
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:30,500
-No, I don't want to.
-Yes, tell me.

916
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,417
No.

917
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,750
Leave me alone.

918
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,125
I questioned her.

919
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,125
The guy was a pleasure boat king.

920
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:57,292
He sailed from one marina to another.

921
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:58,833
He was currently in America.

922
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,250
He phoned three times a day.

923
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,917
He sent 10 telegrams and long letters.

924
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,417
He took lessons to perfect
his French and Swedish.

925
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,333
He was crazy.

926
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,083
And so was I.

927
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:13,083
Tell me!

928
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:14,042
I don't want to.

929
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,458
-Tell me.

930
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,958
Leave me alone.

931
01:08:22,292 --> 01:08:23,125
Tell me!

932
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,167
Tell me what it was like.

933
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:26,792
No.

934
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:30,125
Slut.

935
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,333
He'd go crazy if he saw you here.

936
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,167
But he doesn't see me.

937
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,083
-Luckily.
-No, not luckily.

938
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:47,333
When I left you in St. Tropez, I knew it.

939
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,500
He must know too.

940
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:52,125
You're crazy.

941
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,000
Maybe you want me to call him.

942
01:08:59,125 --> 01:08:59,958
Yes.

943
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,042
I had an idea.

944
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,792
I became obsessed with it.

945
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,667
I would tell her what I wanted...

946
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:20,708
to bring him back.

947
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:23,542
He was in the Bahamas or somewhere.

948
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,542
She should have him come back urgently...

949
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:29,875
the following day.

950
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:30,958
Under what pretext?

951
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:33,458
A good pretext.

952
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:37,708
The truth but slightly altered.

953
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:42,792
I wanted her to tell him
she met a man in Megéve

954
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,083
who held her very close

955
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:46,542
and whom she felt
she could no longer resist.

956
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:49,875
And if he didn't come the next day,

957
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,042
she feared what would happen.

958
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,375
She was asking for help.

959
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,542
Did she refuse?

960
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,875
Yes, she refused.

961
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:06,125
It was time for his morning call
from wherever he was.

962
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:12,500
Hello?

963
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,167
Is it you?

964
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,042
It snowed all last night.

965
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,000
You can't imagine how cold it is.

966
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,042
What?

967
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:29,333
Your chest is bare?

968
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,125
You're making me fantasize.

969
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:35,625
-Your bare chest.
-Marianne, please.

970
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,708
Darling, my skiing
is improving thanks to you.

971
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,958
You said you wanted me
to be a great skier.

972
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:47,792
Marianne.

973
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:51,750
If you don't do it, I'll leave right now.

974
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,333
I didn't read the letters the day before.

975
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,958
I read both yesterday afternoon.

976
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,500
I read both of them.

977
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:03,708
They were delightful.

978
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:08,292
If you do it, I'll marry you.

979
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:11,417
If you do it...

980
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,292
I'll marry you.

981
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,083
Bob...

982
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:23,250
I have something to tell you.

983
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,542
It all went the way you wanted.

984
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,250
He came the next day.

985
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:34,750
There's always a gap
between a dream and its fulfillment.

986
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,458
But it was small,
and he came two days later.

987
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:38,917
I prepared everything.

988
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,667
I booked a room in a new hotel.

989
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,083
He came in and saw us...

990
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,000
Making love?

991
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:45,917
Yes.

992
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:50,292
Who will you marry in the end?

993
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:51,792
Neither.

994
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:53,792
They're interconnected.

995
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:56,417
I loved one because
of the other and vice-versa.

996
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:58,750
It would be a crime to choose.

997
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,833
You need a third.

998
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:04,458
I have her.

999
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,167
Why not?

1000
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,708
Because I don't love you.

1001
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,167
I don't love you either.

1002
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,917
I have a taste for you.

1003
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,083
It's delicious.

1004
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,208
What you want is my help.

1005
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,042
That's how men are today.

1006
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,583
You have to help them without listening.

1007
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:29,333
I hate being useful.

1008
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:31,708
I don't want to.

1009
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:36,417
Forgive me, I forgot about the contract.

1010
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,917
I don't care about the contract,
I'll rip it up.

1011
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,458
-Rip it up?
-Yes, I want you to want me.

1012
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:45,542
But I don't want you.

1013
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:52,208
Hello?

1014
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:53,125
Yes.

1015
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:55,917
A female journalist?

1016
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,167
Oh really?

1017
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,542
Is she-- well, is she...

1018
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:04,333
is she young and pretty?

1019
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:06,708
Okay, well...

1020
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:09,208
Tell her to come up.

1021
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,875
My dear Clara, I...

1022
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:24,458
You want me to take a walk?

1023
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:25,417
You understand.

1024
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:13,083
-Some water?
-What? No... yes.

1025
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:14,167
No, thank you.

1026
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,208
The Algerian War, the Vietnam War,
the Nigerian Civil War...

1027
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:19,958
-Do you want ice?
-No.

1028
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,208
Suez... Budapest--

1029
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:28,583
Yes, that's right,
Suez, Budapest, Prague.

1030
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:30,333
Famine in Africa and Asia.

1031
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:32,875
You know I'm not really to blame.

1032
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:35,208
The Israeli problem, the Black problem...

1033
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,958
You think due to 15 years of writing,
these disasters--

1034
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:41,375
None of these problems matter to you.

1035
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:44,208
The conflict between neo-capitalism
and neo-Marxism,

1036
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:46,917
decolonization, protest, youth,

1037
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,750
overpopulation,
which will become horrible in 20 years

1038
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,958
since the global population will double

1039
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:55,542
and automation will have relegated
half of humankind to unemployment.

1040
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,167
Where did you get your glasses?

1041
01:14:57,875 --> 01:15:00,500
Rather than taking on
the issues of your time,

1042
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:03,083
you've wasted your time on women.

1043
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,917
Today's woman is a monumental problem.

1044
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,667
She claims to be both free and oppressed,

1045
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,375
capricious and conventional,

1046
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,292
man's equal and his dependent.

1047
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:17,417
It's safer to take an interest in politics

1048
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,792
rather than modern women.

1049
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:20,542
Tell me...

1050
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:22,333
what's your name?

1051
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:23,750
Louise.

1052
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:29,292
Tell me, Louise, your glasses...

1053
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:33,125
Some glasses make eyes bigger.

1054
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:36,250
I'm sure yours make them smaller.

1055
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,250
How do you know that?

1056
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:41,375
May 1?

1057
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,667
Oh yes.

1058
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,500
I was right.

1059
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:52,042
Of course, I knew it.

1060
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,625
I liked you from the start.

1061
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,417
I don't even know why.

1062
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,417
There are two women in you.

1063
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,250
First of all, I don't love him.

1064
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:10,583
Secondly, if I love him,
that's precisely why I shouldn't go back.

1065
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:12,750
Third of all, he's a bastard.

1066
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:18,792
Fourth of all, if I love him,
and I go back, I'll be unhappy.

1067
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,750
Fifth of all, I shouldn't go back
if I don't love him,

1068
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,625
and I shouldn't go back if I do.

1069
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:25,708
It's the same thing.

1070
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:45,083
Sixth of all, if I don't go back,

1071
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,458
will that idiot leave me alone?

1072
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:52,167
Seventh of all,
if I don't go back, I'll be unhappy.

1073
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,958
I'll be unhappy no matter what.

1074
01:16:56,708 --> 01:17:00,583
Eighth of all, I'm prepared to be unhappy
whether or not I stay with him.

1075
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:05,333
Ninth of all, I'll be unhappy
for longer if I stay with him

1076
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,125
because I love him.

1077
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:12,958
It's very simple.

1078
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,125
First of all, I'll tell her

1079
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:17,292
I was ridiculous with the girl

1080
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:21,042
because I couldn't stop thinking of you
and couldn't do anything with her.

1081
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:23,917
Second of all,
why couldn't I do anything with her?

1082
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:26,750
Because her only flaw was she wasn't you.

1083
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:27,958
That's where we are.

1084
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:28,917
I love you.

1085
01:17:58,750 --> 01:17:59,667
Are you mad at me?

1086
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:01,667
I don't care.

1087
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,250
I tried to forget you.

1088
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:07,833
I failed.

1089
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,333
What?

1090
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,667
I tried to forget you and failed.

1091
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,292
That girl had only one flaw.

1092
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,042
She wasn't you.

1093
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:25,917
Bastard.

1094
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:29,083
I told her...

1095
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:31,125
I love Clara.

1096
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:38,792
You don't love Clara.

1097
01:18:39,667 --> 01:18:40,875
You love women.

1098
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:57,750
Help!

1099
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,333
Help!

1100
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,125
You're here.

1101
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,292
You're here for real.

1102
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,333
I'm saved.

1103
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,875
I love you.

1104
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:49,292
I love you.

1105
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,833
How?

1106
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,208
You knew, Marianne?

1107
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,667
You knew about Hélène?

1108
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,333
No.

1109
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,083
No, you're mistaken.

1110
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:50,000
If I get married,
it won't be to either of you.

1111
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,917
Yes, I know to whom.

1112
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:57,125
But I don't know if she wants to.

1113
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:02,667
No, Marianne, I'm not a bastard.

1114
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:10,125
You can't control
if you no longer love someone.

1115
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,542
Obviously, it's...

1116
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,750
As you wish.

1117
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:17,750
Hugs and kisses.

1118
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,333
Listen-- hello?

1119
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:20,875
Hello?

1120
01:23:21,917 --> 01:23:22,875
She hung up.

1121
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,000
Good for her.

1122
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:27,042
And Hélène?

1123
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:28,542
I called her first.

1124
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,333
I went in alphabetical order.

1125
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:34,417
You know what we'll do?

1126
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:38,458
We'll go to the seashore!

1127
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,208
I'll never forget you.

1128
01:24:04,417 --> 01:24:06,292
"She loved me and left me."

1129
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,625
"Why?"

1130
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,042
"She was certain...

1131
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,708
that I couldn't bring her...

1132
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:16,333
happiness."

1133
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:19,500
"She condemned me mercilessly."

1134
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,750
"She knew too much about me."

1135
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,708
"That's why she left."

1136
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,708
"After she left...

1137
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,042
I understood...

1138
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:34,583
there was only one thing to do,

1139
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:36,583
give up women...

1140
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:38,708
which I did."

1141
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:41,250
"I am done with women."

1142
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:43,708
Are you sure?

1143
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,000
Yes.

1144
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,333
Really sure?

1145
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,625
Yes, at least I...

1146
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:53,375
I think so.

1147
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,625
It's my impression.

1148
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:59,750
Anyway, you can type "The End."

1149
01:25:00,542 --> 01:25:02,917
THE END

1150
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,750
THE WOMEN

1151

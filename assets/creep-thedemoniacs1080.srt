1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:06,507
<i>At the end of the last century,
on northern Europe's coasts,</i>

2
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,884
<i>lived men who feared
neither God nor the law.</i>

3
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>They lured ships towards the rocks
where they were smashed to pieces.</i>

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,229
These <i>men then plundered the wrecks.
They were called wreckers.</i>

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,774
<i>The captain is their leader.
He is a brute.</i>

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>His strength gives him
power over his henchmen.</i>

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,739
<i>He has committed so many crimes
that he's become almost mad.</i>

8
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,618
<i>Villagers say he is haunted
by the ghosts of his victims.</i>

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,038
<i>His madness makes him
dangerous and unpredictable.</i>

10
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:43,961
<i>Le Bosco, cursed by all navies,
the bad seed of any crew.</i>

11
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:49,341
<i>He landed there dead-drunk from a foreign
ship one night with his bag on his shoulder.</i>

12
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:53,304
<i>He follows the captain,
but this sailor,</i>

13
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:56,140
<i>never without his knife,
dislikes taking orders.</i>

14
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,895
<i>He bides his time like a vulture.
He is false and crafty.</i>

15
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,231
<i>Paul.
He, too, is a former sailor.</i>

16
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,736
<i>He suffers the captain's orders,
but grovels to Le Bosco.</i>

17
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,280
<i>He will be on the winner's side.</i>

18
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:16,660
<i>He is cruel and cowardly and has
a worse temper than the others.</i>

19
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:21,290
<i>He is the strongest, because each of
the three thinks he is on his side.</i>

20
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,919
<i>Tina, the wrecker.
The angel of the accursed.</i>

21
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,295
<i>Wild and perverted.</i>

22
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,590
<i>This cruel animal is always
ready to snap up the</i>

23
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,593
<i>innocent who come too close
to her she-wolf jaws.</i>

24
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>She will show no pity.</i>

25
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,432
<i>It's a game for her to plunder wrecks
and kill survivors.</i>

26
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,185
<i>More than one dead man,
his throat cut,</i>

27
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:47,608
<i>takes with him the image of her
magnificently shameless naked body.</i>

28
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,240
Help.

29
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,034
Help.

30
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,791
Help.

31
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,959
Help us!

32
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,560
Help!

33
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,896
Something wrong, Captain?

34
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,902
Leave me alone.

35
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,363
Look!

36
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,284
Hey, clear off, you drunk.
- Get lost.

37
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,319
Now what's the matter?
Have you gone mad?

38
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,866
There. A moment ago.
Didn't you see anything?

39
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,660
Here? I'm the only one here.

40
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,185
Are you afraid of ghosts, Captain?

41
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,826
I thought I saw something.
It's nothing. It's nothing.

42
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,874
It's nothing.

43
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,515
Sounds like he saw a ghost.

44
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,268
Maybe there was a ghost.

45
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,645
Just for him?

46
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,690
Yes. Just for him.

47
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,063
Help!

48
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,976
Bring us some drinks.

49
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,691
A ship has been wrecked on the rocks.

50
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,151
A ship? When?

51
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,362
Only a few hours ago.

52
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,781
How do you know?

53
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,117
Were you there?

54
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,579
To cause a shipwreck?

55
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,582
O" Purpose?

56
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,334
Of course it was on purpose.

57
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,376
Shut up!

58
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,463
You know very well there
are no wreckers anymore.

59
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,090
Who knows?

60
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,384
The tide may have
washed up the bodies.

61
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,804
I asked you if you were there.

62
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:15,520
What about you? Were you there?
- Me? No.

63
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,523
I was here!

64
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,817
So, why have you got
blood on your shirt?

65
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,034
You're crazy.
There's nothing there.

66
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,164
God curse the wreckers!

67
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,424
The sun is rising over the shore!

68
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,344
A sad and gray day!

69
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,097
The tide is out!

70
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,226
I can see two small figures.

71
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,853
They are getting up!

72
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,149
They start walking.
- That's enough!

73
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,152
Shut up!

74
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,029
They are still weak.

75
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,617
They support each other
and stagger forward.

76
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:17,540
Be warned! If they discover the
secret of this cursed village,

77
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,418
nothing will stop
them from taking revenge.

78
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,833
Let the ghosts come.
I'm not afraid of anyone.

79
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,918
Let them come and see the captain!

80
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,971
God or devil.
Come and have your throats slit.

81
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,265
Come on, then.

82
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,101
Come on, ghosts.

83
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,273
Come on, phantoms. Come on, demons.

84
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,484
Come back and see the captain.

85
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:27,985
I challenge you.

86
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,199
You died tonight.
I will kill you again!

87
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,702
We have to shut him up or
he'll tell them everything.

88
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,037
He's drunk.

89
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:41,957
I saw your heads smashed
against the rocks!

90
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,056
What the hell is going on'?

91
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,731
I don't want any trouble here.

92
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,568
It's morning. We're closing now.
Finish your drinks and go.

93
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,622
- <i>It happened one windy night</i> ~

94
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:07,001
- <i>It happened one stormy night</i> ~

95
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,713
- <i>Crashed on the rocks,</i> a <i>stray ship</i> ~

96
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,550
- <i>Leaves two beautiful innocent girls</i> ~

97
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:21,390
- <i>A celebration of beauty</i> ~
- <i>A celebration of beauty</i> ~

98
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,935
- <i>Some accursed men were wandering about</i> ~

99
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,272
- <i>Full of wine and alcohol!</i> ~

100
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:32,067
- <i>They plundered the wrecks at night</i> ~

101
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:36,572
- <i>Innocence destroyed by rape</i> ~

102
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:44,622
- <i>A celebration of beauty</i> ~

103
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,841
I should've killed that bastard.

104
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,054
What are you going on about, Louise?

105
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,139
It's only a song, Bosco.

106
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,518
A story about wreckers.

107
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,730
There are no wreckers nowadays.

108
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,608
It's just a song.

109
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,488
As long as it's just a song.

110
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,616
I don't want to hear your damn song!

111
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,952
It makes me sick! Bloody hell!

112
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:35,130
There's a curse on this village.
The demons are free.

113
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,591
What did you see? Tell me!

114
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,095
There were two ghosts.
They were staggering about.

115
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,391
Pale and covered in blood,
with crazed eyes.

116
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,645
There were two women.
- Where did you see them?

117
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:53,607
Over there, by the ship cemetery,
near the haunted ruins.

118
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,861
Come with me, you two. Hurry.

119
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,747
The devil has been set free!

120
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,584
God help us.

121
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,546
He has been imprisoned in
the ruins for centuries.

122
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,841
Now he is free.

123
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,553
Misfortune is upon us!

124
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,015
I can sense that he's still in the ruins!

125
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:31,437
Maybe now his long wait will be over.

126
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:59,441
They're here.
We must drive them out.

127
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,819
They won't come out alive!

128
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,446
What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.

129
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:09,702
That's enough. If they are alive,
they must be exhausted.

130
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,286
We'll easily catch them.

131
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,205
We must try to capture them alive.

132
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,250
Why?
- I want to finish them off.

133
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:02,087
Over here. I can see them.

134
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,594
Give me that.

135
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,231
Stupid bitches.

136
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,871
They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.

137
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,249
We can't search all the wrecks.

138
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,877
Did you see anything, Bosco?

139
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,880
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.

140
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,299
We must wait until daybreak.

141
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,136
We'll find them eventually.

142
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,265
I know how to drive them out.
Paul, bring your lamp.

143
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,934
Come here, all of you.
Le Bosco has an idea.

144
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,270
You come down too!

145
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,023
Hurry up.
- Let's go.

146
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,574
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn them.

147
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,200
Give me your lantern.

148
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,510
Stay here and tell me if you see them.

149
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,382
Bosco!

150
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,141
Tina?

151
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,061
Bosco! Captain!

152
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,959
Come on, we have to find Tina!

153
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:40,652
There they are!

154
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,406
There they are!
They're heading for the ruins.

155
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:45,782
The cursed ruins.

156
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,034
Let me go!
- No.

157
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,037
You mustn't go there.

158
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,709
Look! They're over here!

159
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,212
Captain! Bosco!

160
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,640
They're over here with me.

161
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,727
Come back.

162
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,066
Don't go over there!

163
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,241
Stop! Don't go over there!

164
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,701
Come back!

165
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,584
Tina!
- Follow me.

166
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,046
Come on.

167
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,176
Tina!

168
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,887
Come on.
- Don't go there!

169
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,013
Let go of me.

170
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,099
Let me go.

171
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,518
Leave me. Don't touch me!

172
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,772
Leave me alone.
I want to get them.

173
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,858
I want to kill them!

174
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:46,695
For God's sake, let me kill them!

175
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,532
Let go of me.

176
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,496
Don't go there!

177
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,713
Come back here. It's high tide.

178
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,173
You'll be caught in the seaweed.

179
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,968
You'll be killed. You crazy?

180
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,762
Don't go to the ruins. Come back!

181
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,409
They were in the marshes.

182
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,582
They are wounded.
Let me take care of them.

183
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,752
I'll look after them.

184
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:32,420
All right.

185
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,882
You knew the risk you were
taking bringing them here.

186
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,384
It's too late now.

187
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:42,889
Look after them so they can rest.
I'll speak to them afterwards.

188
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,995
I know you are there!

189
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,872
You saw them!

190
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,293
They can set you free if they wish.

191
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,838
But you're the one who has to wait!

192
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:01,342
They have to come of their own free will.

193
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,013
I've seen how pure they are.

194
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,016
How innocent they are!

195
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:15,148
I won't intervene,
but I beg you to spare them!

196
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,989
So be it.

197
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,242
Let destiny be fulfilled!

198
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,892
Don't you want to play,
Madame Louise?

199
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,104
Last night ended in tragedy.

200
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,274
What happened?
- There was a shipwreck.

201
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,486
And the captain thought
he saw the ghosts.

202
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,531
Le Bosco was also acting strangely.

203
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,410
And at dawn
- What happened at dawn?

204
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:14,499
They were in the marshes near
the haunted ruins at dawn.

205
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,292
And now

206
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:18,544
...there they are.

207
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,839
How do you know all of this?

208
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,634
I just know.

209
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,556
What if they're still alive?

210
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:33,017
For God's sake, shut up!

211
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,315
The captain has shut himself in his house.
He's afraid.

212
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,150
You're all crazy!

213
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,322
You know what's hidden
away in the ruins.

214
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,408
If they made it there

215
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,036
Two girls. Wounded and exhausted!

216
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,747
I think they must have drowned!

217
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,374
I hope so.

218
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,962
If they are hiding in the
ruins and they free

219
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,047
Don't mention his name!

220
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,308
We don't really know what's
hiding in the ruins.

221
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,268
Yeah.

222
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:16,894
But

223
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,856
if they manage to get that far

224
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,901
What will happen?

225
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:33,578
All I know is that no one has been there
for at least a century.

226
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,664
Shut up! You don't know
what you're talking about.

227
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,625
Do you understand?

228
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,512
Help! Stop it!

229
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,600
That's enough from you.

230
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,602
Come here with me instead.

231
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,605
With you?

232
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,025
All right.

233
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,919
We're not allowed to talk about
what's down there, in the ruins.

234
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,299
You know it. We are doomed
when he will be set free.

235
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,404
They can no longer speak!

236
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,157
We have to help them.

237
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,618
You're the only one who can help them.

238
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,246
I will save you.

239
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,999
I will give you back peace.

240
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,002
You needn't be afraid of us.

241
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,549
The ludicrous costume helps keep
the villagers away from the ruins.

242
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,386
As for me,
I'm the keeper of this tomb.

243
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,765
Try to tell me how I can assist you.

244
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:42,678
Revenge.

245
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,264
You are free to take your revenge.

246
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:51,937
The one supposed to be in this tomb
is trapped somewhere in these ruins.

247
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:57,068
He can only be liberated by
innocent hands, by victims of evil.

248
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:03,157
Tonight he will call you.
He knows you are here.

249
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:07,453
It's up to you whether or not
you want to set him free.

250
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:13,584
Only he can give you the means
to take revenge and find peace again.

251
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:17,630
But he's a black angel, a
demon wearing a habit.

252
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,592
If you set him free, you will
also release his dark forces

253
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,762
which have been locked
away for a century now.

254
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:30,601
The entity imprisoned in these
ruins can be very dangerous.

255
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,855
Right now he's possessed.
Evil lives within him.

256
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,859
The one behind the door is two-faced!

257
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:42,780
You can find peace there, or death.

258
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:47,743
It's up to you now.
You can expect him to call you tonight.

259
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,215
Stop fidgeting.

260
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,175
I know they will return.

261
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:07,054
Until I touch their corpses
with my own hands,

262
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,266
I won't believe they are dead!

263
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,601
Where do you expect them to be?

264
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,690
They're dead, I tell you.

265
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:20,693
It's as if I can see them.

266
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,904
I can feel them watching me..

267
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:28,868
Their spirit is searching
my head to find me.

268
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:32,246
Their hatred won't leave me!

269
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,291
I know they will return.

270
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,335
They can think of nothing else but me.

271
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,423
They're looking for me in
order to take their revenge.

272
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:47,303
Dead or alive,
I know they will be back.

273
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,555
I know they will be back.

274
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,477
I saw them in the tavern!

275
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,732
They were covered in blood.

276
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,443
They were watching me.

277
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,618
You don't care, do you?
You weren't there.

278
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:39,230
You don't believe in ghosts!

279
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,942
You're nothing but a trollop.

280
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:43,002
No.

281
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,462
No, you can't make me forget them.

282
00:57:52,261 --> 00:57:53,887
They will kill us!

283
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,350
They came back from the dead

284
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,647
to tear us apart.

285
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,821
Good for them if they are alive!

286
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:17,620
I will kill them like
wicked creatures.

287
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,788
I want to strangle them.

288
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:23,083
I want to feel their bones
breaking between my fingers.

289
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:27,463
I want to overpower them,
drink their blood and wounds.

290
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:31,175
I'll smash them with my heels
and you'll be there to see it.

291
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,968
There will be nothing left of them.

292
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,012
Nothing!

293
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,347
Nothing!

294
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:31,026
I tell you I saw them,
as clear as I see you now.

295
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,697
The captain's gone completely mad.
He should be locked up.

296
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,990
He's becoming dangerous.

297
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,750
Everyone seems to know about it.

298
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:51,839
News travels fast around here.
People are staying indoors.

299
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,095
There's no way they can know.
- We've said too much.

300
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:03,308
There's that sailor who saw the
girls in the ship cemetery.

301
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:07,104
What about Louise, did she see anything?

302
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,774
Louise? Yes, maybe.

303
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,318
She has second sight.

304
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,420
Tragedy is upon the village.

305
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:34,923
Tonight he will be free!

306
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,175
Who do you mean?

307
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,553
The one who hides in the ruins.

308
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:41,889
I can see him!

309
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:44,433
He is waiting

310
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:47,561
He is calling.

311
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,170
I can see you!

312
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,213
Open this door,

313
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:24,801
so the devil's fury may be
unleashed on this cursed land.

314
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:29,056
Let the death of us all be
the price of your life.

315
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:32,893
Unleash all the forces
of evil upon us!

316
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:35,270
I will give you the power.

317
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,022
Go on.

318
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,000
That's it!

319
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,003
Now open the door.

320
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,465
Good.

321
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:06,051
He is free!

322
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:01,023
You came when I called to you.

323
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,986
I am free and you will sacrifice
your bodies to me. Come.

324
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,743
You say nothing,
but you speak to me with your minds.

325
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:18,707
I will give you all my power, so
that you may carry out your revenge.

326
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:13,204
You may go.
Now I am within you.

327
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:17,292
You have all of my
power until sunrise.

328
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,546
Once the daylight comes, you will
be just as weak as you were before.

329
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:23,423
Go now.

330
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:27,385
You only have a few hours
to carry out your revenge.

331
01:12:58,791 --> 01:12:59,667
They're alive.

332
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:03,129
I saw them. Poor things.

333
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,051
So, Louise, who did you see?
- Tell us what you know.

334
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,428
I didn't see anyone.

335
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,389
But I do know everything
that happened.

336
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:14,891
That's the way I am.

337
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,269
I know things I have never seen!

338
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:20,980
I've heard about your
gift of second sight.

339
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:22,815
Are they alive?

340
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,902
They're alive.
- Where are they?

341
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:28,488
Right here.

342
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,207
No, Bosco!
- Calm down!

343
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,459
Captain, stop him!

344
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,449
So there you are, my children.

345
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,078
You are very much as I imagined.

346
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,706
Yes, I've seen you before.
Here, in my head.

347
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,626
What's your name?

348
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:49,754
You don't want to tell me!

349
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,675
What about you? How old are you?

350
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,260
I see. You're not very talkative!

351
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:58,513
Are you hungry?

352
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,226
Thirsty?

353
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,854
Good that's a start!

354
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,566
But I would like to hear
the sound of your voice.

355
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:14,987
Maybe you aren't able to speak!

356
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,866
Is that it? Are you mute?

357
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,081
Poor wretches, they are mute!

358
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:28,042
Monique, bring them some grenadine.

359
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:41,013
I understand.

360
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,266
You have to leave.

361
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:46,936
Let me look at you a while longer.

362
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,481
I'm afraid I may never see you again.

363
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,318
Listen, I would never betray you.

364
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:58,156
You can always think of me as a friend!

365
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:01,951
Are you afraid of those girls?

366
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,120
Cowards. Coward.

367
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,248
You're running away.
You're terrified.

368
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,792
I'm not afraid of them. I'm going.

369
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,087
I'll bring you back their heads.

370
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:26,976
Where are they?

371
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,269
I'm not afraid. I want them.

372
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:31,355
They just left for the hills.

373
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,275
Would you shut your mouth, bitch.
Who asked you?

374
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,213
Help me.

375
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:35,349
Beware,

376
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:41,147
the sailors were here.
They were completely drunk.

377
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,567
Save yourselves.

378
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:07,042
There is nothing I can do.
I have no more power left.

379
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:14,466
Yes, I can save them by myself

380
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,887
if you wait here until daybreak.

381
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,849
You will keep them alive until then!

382
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,269
My powers will leave
you and return to me.

383
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:26,520
I will save them.

384
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,069
Yes, I know what will happen.

385
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:39,575
You will be left powerless
against your enemies.

386
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,911
You will be quite defenseless.

387
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,955
But they will live thanks to you.

388
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:51,462
That's good.

389
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,089
It's nearly dawn.

390
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:58,677
Leave as soon as it's light.

391
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,639
Try to save yourselves.

392
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:03,349
They will live!

393
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:09,897
Your revenge escapes you.

394
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,068
In this crazy world

395
01:25:14,485 --> 01:25:17,905
the only thing that might possibly
be left for you is generosity.

396
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:12,084
Do they have to die?
- In a short while.

397
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:14,545
I would like to save them.

398
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,757
They gave us their lives.

399
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,051
Can't you help them?

400
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,847
Nothing can save them now.

401
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,393
No, I cannot leave the ruins.

402
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,230
But their revenge will be carried out.

403
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,650
The four pirates are condemned.
They will perish.

404
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:40,446
We will go to meet them!

405
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,531
You will be too late.

406
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:44,825
That doesn't matter.

407
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:11,698
We've finally got you.
You will die here!

408
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:17,538
You little she-devils!
No magic can save you this time.

409
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,212
Stupid whores!

410
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,148
Take advantage of them again!

411
01:33:28,145 --> 01:33:29,604
Tear it!

412
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:40,490
More. Go on!

413
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:44,995
<i>Tear'.</i>

414
01:34:05,766 --> 01:34:06,725
Trash.

415
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,103
Bitch.

416
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:13,273
Here I go, slut.

417
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:17,819
Hit the sluts!

418
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,617
Blood! Oh, yes!

419
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:26,578
It's gonna hurt.

420
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,021
I'm gonna I'm gonna

421
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:38,942
Hurts, doesn't it?

422
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:47,492
Arching

423
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,084
You liked it?

424
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,712
Stop it. Are you crazy?

425
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:06,423
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

426
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:34,195
What have I done?

427
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:38,616
They're going to drown.

428
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:40,910
No!

429
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,079
No!

430
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,837
They're innocent.

431
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:54,674
Innocent.

1
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:57,950
Supreme Master of the Dragon Sect

2
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,369
Long Er

3
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,332
Why did your mission fail?

4
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,544
Master, it was screwed up

5
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,586
By a rascal called Wilson Bond

6
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,631
Is he a kung fu master?

7
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,842
Quite the opposite!

8
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,301
Is he good with poison?

9
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,636
Hardly!

10
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,849
Is he handsome and smart

11
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,101
You fell under his charms?

12
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,561
Definitely not!

13
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:28,397
He's ugly as a pig, despicable as a dog

14
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,357
A sweet-talking scoundrel

15
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,110
How can he defeat you?

16
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,653
Please punish me!

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,823
Maybe it's your destiny

18
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,952
He's probably your jinx

19
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,164
Be careful when you see him again

20
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,623
Yes, Master!

21
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,339
I'm destined to die tonight

22
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,593
You will succeed me

23
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,523
Enter the blood pool now

24
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,693
Resume your true self

25
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,112
And take over my position

26
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,534
Wu San Gui's son will meet
the Qing Emperor at the capital

27
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,494
You must protect him

28
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,913
Yes, Master!

29
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,623
The Dragon Sect

30
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,293
Has assisted Wu for 3 generations

31
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,587
You'll assume my responsibility

32
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,007
And help put him on the throne

33
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,054
Follow me into the blood pool

34
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,932
You will then gain my power

35
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,684
You must remember

36
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,270
Our kung fu is unique

37
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,398
If you lose your virginity

38
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,193
80%  of your power

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,905
Will go to your first man

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,449
Don't forget!

41
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,650
Supreme Master of the Dragon Sect

42
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,154
Bond, I'll get even with you!

43
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,335
Girls! Come meet your clients!

44
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,628
Be a beggar, be a beggar. . .

45
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,046
Go to hell, go to hell. . .

46
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,173
Be a beggar, be a beggar. . .

47
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,468
Go to hell, go to hell. . .

48
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,137
Be a beggar, be a beggar. . .

49
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,474
Go to hell, go to hell. . .

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,476
This time your family is dead!

51
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,980
Says who?

52
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,481
My sister is right here!

53
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,774
That's slander!

54
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,067
1 00,000 taels as penalty

55
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,155
He didn't mean it. Forgive him!

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,239
I didn't mean it

57
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,908
Pleading for him? What's going on?

58
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,745
Nothing! We're innocent!

59
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,873
We're pure and honest!

60
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,167
Very pure, very honest!

61
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,169
I can't stand you two! I'll go piss!

62
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,673
- Hey beauty!
- Bastard!

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,764
Quiet!

64
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,515
Is Bond in the next room?

65
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,350
Yes!

66
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,018
No! Yes...no!

67
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,436
Yes or no?

68
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,104
What has he done to you?

69
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,776
He's assisting the Qing Emperor

70
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,819
Everyone should kill him!

71
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,948
Thank goodness! I have suffered

72
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,034
And waited for so long! Thank you!

73
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,535
You are. . .

74
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,912
He killed my whole family

75
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,122
Made me worship him!

76
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,250
That bastard! We must kill him!

77
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,169
Go ahead, I'll get ready to celebrate!

78
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,754
Wait! You take us to him!

79
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,715
Sure, let me get my glasses

80
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,387
This way...

81
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,229
We're innocent

82
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,647
Shut up, your bastard!

83
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,275
Bastard...

84
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,527
I'm in deep trouble!

85
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,653
You cannot deny it!

86
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,906
Bond, I want to kill you Skin you alive

87
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,199
and break your bones!

88
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,284
What is this?

89
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,287
Just so you know

90
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,665
I'm Li Ke, pupil of the One-Arm Nun

91
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,041
I'm Wilson Bond?

92
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,045
Guards! Help!

93
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,630
Guards! Help me!

94
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,929
No need to be afraid, calm down!

95
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,931
Lucky I have bodyguards

96
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,766
Of course, you have too many enemies

97
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,618
It's a girl!

98
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,121
Pretty too!

99
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,373
Then. . .let's. . .

100
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,501
I understand!

101
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,469
Stop!

102
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,053
Why are you still here?

103
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,972
You'll get killed!

104
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,639
Don't worry!

105
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,892
I wasn't sure you're anti-Qing

106
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,101
But now

107
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,145
I must disclose my identity

108
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,522
I'm the descendent of the condor hero

109
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,399
Master of Invincible East

110
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,985
My name is Vincible West

111
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,404
Vincible West?

112
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,658
You're the righteous Vincible West?

113
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,701
Don't move!

114
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,495
Or I'll kill them!

115
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,413
Give him poisoned wine!

116
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,499
What?

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,375
That one over there!

118
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,715
- What? You. . .
- Don't!

119
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,386
He'll lose his senses

120
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,014
And must copulate with a woman in 1 hour

121
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,350
Or else he'll become a pool of blood

122
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,019
Drink up!

123
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,687
No! Don't drink it!

124
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,523
I cannot implicate you

125
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,031
I have finished it

126
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,324
Let them go!

127
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,035
Fine! Let's go!

128
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,667
Bastard!

129
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,878
How do you feel?

130
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,171
The poison is acting up

131
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:09,673
Save me. . .

132
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,258
How?

133
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,636
I need to copulate with a young woman

134
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,555
To neutralize the poison

135
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,974
We can't. . .

136
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,893
If we. . .with you...

137
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,062
We can save you?

138
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,897
I'm flattered

139
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,650
But I can't! You better go!

140
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,401
Hurry!

141
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,902
You risked your life to save us

142
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,612
We'll remember your benevolence!

143
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,574
We'll burn you more money

144
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,452
You can't leave me now!

145
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,667
Your pathetic trick can't fool anyone

146
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,919
Miss, don't believe him!

147
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,922
What! You. . . Let's go!

148
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,300
This is none of your business!

149
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,510
- Guards! Beat him!
- Go on!

150
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,617
Don't pursue him!

151
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,621
Are you alright? I am Wu Ying Xiong

152
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,664
My father is Wu San Gui

153
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,790
I'm Li Ke

154
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,754
Master said Wu San Gui is a traitor!

155
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,048
We must not befriend his son!

156
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,508
I know what I'm doing

157
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,638
Thank you! Till we meet again!

158
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,308
- Miss!
- Don't!

159
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,686
You're in trouble. That was Wilson Bond

160
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,022
What? That's Wilson Bond?

161
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,737
The guy inside is a kung fu master

162
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,656
So was Ao Bai, but I took care of him

163
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,948
We better go get help!

164
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,746
- Your Excellency!
- What is it?

165
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,248
His Majesty summons you

166
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,003
Where is His Majesty?

167
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,630
Why do you want us here?

168
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,131
I was bullied today

169
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,926
Take revenge for me after the meeting

170
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,386
Who dares to bully you?

171
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,430
Someone quite capable of course!

172
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,891
His fists are big as pots, eyes are like bells

173
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,227
A long tongue and much taller than me

174
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,228
Hey you! Stop!

175
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,606
You're a bit like him! You 2 come take a look

176
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,110
You look exactly like him!

177
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,195
Is my tongue really that long?

178
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,906
You are the sissy!

179
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,033
How dare you tread on my turf! Fix him!

180
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,051
Hold him off! I'll go get help!

181
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,179
His Majesty is here!

182
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,308
- His Majesty!
- Rise!

183
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,187
Minister Bond, what's going on?

184
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,481
This sissy broke into the Palace

185
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,941
He peeped at the royal concubine

186
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,860
I tried to stop him but was beaten up

187
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,569
- Really?
- Yes!

188
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,486
What is your title, Minister Bond?

189
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,529
426! No!

190
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,781
Secretary of Grand Council and Duke of Deer Tripod

191
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,158
What can I do for you?

192
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,701
Don't you recognize me?

193
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,663
You're the sissy's accomplice!

194
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,624
Watch your mouth, Minister Bond!

195
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,503
He is Wu San Gui's eldest son, Wu Ying Xiong

196
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,256
He's here to discuss state affairs

197
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,301
How handsome you are, Prince Wu!

198
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,219
So nice to meet you!

199
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,764
This is Mr. Long, my top warrior

200
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,973
I brought him to the Palace

201
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,058
Mr. Top Warrior!

202
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,478
You look magnificent!

203
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,812
So nice to meet you!

204
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,314
What did you say I was?

205
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,648
A kung fu expert!

206
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,444
I have utmost admiration for you. . .

207
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,654
Cut the crap, serve dinner!

208
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,496
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely!

209
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,337
Mr. Top Warrior, a toast!

210
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,172
Let's forget our misunderstanding!

211
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:21,674
Please!

212
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,056
Prince, with Mr. Top Warrior

213
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,891
You'll be triumphant at war

214
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,268
Including the one you wage on the Capital

215
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,437
What? Are you accusing me of treason?

216
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,273
Today. . . I'm so happy!

217
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,151
Let's have some entertainment!

218
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,488
Good idea! What do you have in mind?

219
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,574
Mr. Top Warrior is so capable

220
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,743
I wish to bet 1 00 taels of silver

221
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,497
He beat our men within 1 0 stances

222
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,874
- Maybe not!
- No?

223
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,544
Then I bet 1 million taels you'll lose

224
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,587
- Deal!
- Thank you!

225
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,298
- Prince!
- Don't make me lose face!

226
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,263
Your Majesty!

227
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,974
- Rise!
- Thank you!

228
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,695
Mr. Long, you may begin

229
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,907
1 23456789

230
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:28,700
One more!

231
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,911
Long! Don't lose face!

232
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,793
1 0!

233
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,634
Well? Thank you for the silver

234
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,097
- Can I pay later?
- Fine!

235
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,518
Please forgive me for hurting them!

236
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,771
Don't blame yourself!

237
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,565
Thank you, Your Majesty!

238
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,111
I have an announcement to make

239
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,741
I've decided to let
Princess Jian Ning marry Prince Wu

240
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,036
He'll be my brother-in-law

241
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,537
We'll all be family

242
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,747
Thank you, Your Majesty!

243
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,125
That's the best news all day!

244
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,046
You'll be the Imperial Envoy

245
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,048
Escort the Princess to Yunnan

246
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,593
Thank you, Your Majesty!

247
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,887
Do you know why I agree to this?

248
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,848
You must have you reasons, I dare not make guesses

249
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,935
Since Ao Bai's death

250
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,228
I have the allegiance of my subjects

251
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,982
Except rebels like Chen Jin Nan and

252
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,611
The Ming Princess, One-Arm Nun

253
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,656
These small potatoes are harmless

254
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,616
But I'm losing sleep over

255
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,661
My mortal enemy, Wu San Gui

256
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,831
Why make the Princess marry his son?

257
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,042
I have received news

258
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,545
He's enlisting an army and colluding
with the Dragon Sect

259
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,256
The bogus Empress Dowager must be part of his plan

260
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,050
He is rebellious

261
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,386
I'm appointing you as Imperial Envoy

262
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,929
Do you know my intention?

263
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,138
Find a way to eliminate him?

264
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,056
Certainly not!

265
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,102
If we kill him, we must uproot him

266
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,688
Control him by conciliation for now

267
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,648
Placate Wu San Gui

268
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,775
Stall him

269
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,777
When the time is right

270
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,446
I'll send troops in for a clean sweep

271
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,115
I understand!

272
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,866
My only worry

273
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,536
Is Jian Ning will refuse

274
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,998
- Try to persuade her!
- Yes!

275
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,885
Your Highness!

276
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,971
- Rise!
- Thank you!

277
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,015
You 2 may step down!

278
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,349
Yes!

279
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,313
You're killing me!

280
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,024
That's too easy for you!

281
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,233
You don't come see me anymore!

282
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,819
- I'm here now!
- That's better!

283
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,864
Congratulations!

284
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,449
I have great news!

285
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,868
Congratulations to you too!

286
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,287
I also have good news for you!

287
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:19,871
Again?

288
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,788
You go first!

289
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,041
His Majesty has agreed to your marriage

290
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:23,708
Really?

291
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,210
You will marry. . .

292
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,671
Wu San Gui's son, Wu Ying Xiong

293
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,340
I'm the Imperial Envoy escorting you

294
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,468
No way!

295
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,594
Why?

296
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,804
Because I'm pregnant!

297
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:45,021
I'm scared...

298
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:55,907
Really scarred...

299
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,703
What shall we do?

300
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,373
This is serious! I'll be beheaded

301
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,460
Go ask for my hand in marriage

302
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,963
I promise not to beat you

303
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,381
- You're too kind!
- Yes!

304
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,551
His Majesty cannot renege on a promise

305
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,678
Then I'll tell him you raped me

306
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,306
How can you turn things around!

307
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,975
Then I'll marry Wu Ying Xiong

308
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,393
Let him be the father to our child

309
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,104
But you must come to me every night

310
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,731
Then we'll be adulterers

311
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,816
They'll drown us!

312
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,860
Drowned or beheaded, take your pick!

313
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,941
We've reached 1 0 Miles Pavilion

314
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,152
We'll take a rest!

315
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,320
Prince, we'll rest here!

316
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,155
Yes, Your Majesty!

317
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,704
Let me help you!

318
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,793
You look magnificent in the armor

319
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,712
You have my utmost admiration...

320
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,462
Go to hell!

321
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,339
It's so damn hot! This hat looks like. . .

322
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,050
I've been shot in the head by an arrow

323
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,302
Please!

324
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,764
- Have a nice trip!
- Thank you!

325
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,434
- Here's to you!
- Cheers!

326
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,063
Bond!

327
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,111
So boring!

328
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,280
- What is it?
- I want you to play turtle!

329
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,159
Are you kidding? I'm sending you off!

330
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,328
Don't run around, I'm looking out for you

331
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,495
Looks like a lightning rod!

332
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,039
Thunder will strike you!

333
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,332
If it thunders

334
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,834
I'll get struck no matter what!

335
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,628
- Yes!
- Here, take this!

336
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,422
Jerk!

337
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,883
Stand up straight!

338
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,345
You look majestic!

339
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:22,887
Of course!

340
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,640
No one dares to touch the Emperor!

341
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,724
Bastard King!

342
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,189
Protect His Majesty!

343
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:39,820
Be careful!

344
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,324
Protect His Majesty!

345
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,076
Ice Palm?

346
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,769
Bastard King!

347
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,105
Protect His Majesty, you loafer!

348
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,690
- What?
- Protect him!

349
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,158
Ice Palm!

350
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,463
Are you alright?

351
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,465
Lucky for my Silk Armour

352
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,758
Are you alright?

353
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,552
You saved my life, I'll name you...

354
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,845
Protect me!

355
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,512
What?

356
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:58,482
Protect His Majesty!

357
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,418
Rong!

358
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,754
Protect His Majesty!

359
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,548
- What's your name?
- Derek Wan

360
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,342
- I'll kill your family!
- Thank you!

361
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,429
Why is everyone here all at once?

362
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,558
Damn! Why are you bare footed?

363
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,685
Don't push!

364
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,105
Stop grabbing me!

365
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,775
We can't help it!

366
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,151
Who is so cocky?

367
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,074
- You bastard!
- Yes, how are you?

368
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,868
We can't fight like this

369
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,287
Let's push them out first

370
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:53,871
Alright!

371
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,124
Go to hell!

372
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,266
Your Majesty, you better go!

373
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,397
Please send me away as well!

374
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,356
One moment!

375
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,285
How much longer?

376
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,927
No need to push so hard!

377
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,702
Bastard! How far can you run?

378
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,663
I'll go as far as you go!

379
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,583
Take them hostage!

380
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,084
Go!

381
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,548
Go after them now!

382
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,217
Don't worry, I'll save the Prince

383
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,343
And Duke Bond as well!

384
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,682
Members of the Dragon Sect

385
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,352
Pursue the nun and Prince Wu!

386
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,202
What are you doing?

387
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,287
The sword is in front

388
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,039
Naturally my head stays back

389
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,666
You scoundrel! I'll kill you!

390
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,005
Master

391
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,508
Are you alright?

392
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,135
I didn't expect Kang Xi's bodyguard

393
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,929
To be such a kung fu expert

394
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,640
Perhaps Qing dogs' days are not over

395
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,559
Shall I go find a doctor?

396
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,519
Stop!

397
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,730
Bond is a cunning rascal

398
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,898
Let's kill him first

399
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,817
I was just trying to help!

400
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,695
No! He's Kang Xi's confidant

401
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,739
He's our amulet

402
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,241
Let's kill him instead

403
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,117
No!

404
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,578
Miss Ke, I saved you at Li Chun Brothel

405
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,579
Remember?

406
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,624
You've seen him before?

407
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,462
Yesterday, we almost fell victim to

408
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,673
Bond's treacherous scheme

409
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,841
This gentleman saved us

410
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,302
Why didn't you tell me before?

411
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,179
You also forgot to tell her

412
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,349
This gentleman is Wu San Gui's son

413
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,935
The kung fu expert works for him

414
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,564
He's Wu San Gui's son?

415
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,773
Let me kill him!

416
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,110
No, please don't kill me

417
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,737
You dare to disobey me?

418
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,829
Help! I'm over here!

419
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,416
Release the hostages!

420
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,251
Come and get them if you can!

421
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,563
Don't worry, she's wounded

422
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,700
To die from my Yi Yang Finger

423
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,285
Is your privilege

424
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,581
I took the liberty

425
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,167
To help you

426
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,710
Please forgive me!

427
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,755
What? You used a gun!

428
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,048
Why did you help me?

429
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:21,930
Mr. Wu!

430
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,849
Relax!

431
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,476
He's just asleep!

432
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,852
You may speak freely now

433
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,687
Please forgive my manners

434
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,108
Qing Ming?

435
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,653
Overthrow Qing restore Ming!

436
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,529
You're from Tian Di Hui?

437
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,697
Yes!

438
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,576
I'm head of the Greenwood Branch

439
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,995
Here's proof of my identity

440
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,248
Master Chen sent me to the Palace as undercover

441
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,084
It's my pleasure to meet you today

442
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,670
Don't believe him! He's a liar!

443
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,421
The token is genuine!

444
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,215
How is Master Chen?

445
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,592
Very well, thank you!

446
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,260
He mentions you all the time

447
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,179
That his kung fu is second to you

448
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,806
Your are indeed the master

449
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,307
He's nowhere compared to you

450
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,728
Master Chen is too kind

451
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,190
I wish to become your pupil!

452
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,817
I wonder if I may have the honor?

453
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,902
Please get up!

454
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,237
Unless you agree

455
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,947
I won't get up

456
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,244
- Alright!
- Thank you!

457
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,289
I know you're prejudiced against me

458
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,375
In time, you'll understand

459
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,421
I'll take you in temporarily

460
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,798
Until I get Master Chen's consent

461
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,508
I cannot teach you anything

462
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,219
Thank you, sister. . .no, Master!

463
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,596
We can't stay here

464
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,223
Let's leave!

465
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,059
One of my pupils is waiting for us ahead

466
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:49,852
Yes!

467
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,107
Is the One-Armed swordsman your father?

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,108
No!

469
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,402
There Is An Inn

470
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,362
Indeed

471
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,883
Minister Duo, who are you staring at that man?

472
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,261
That's a woman!

473
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,554
How do you know?

474
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,723
Everyone else vomits when they see me

475
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,849
Except him

476
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,058
So she's not a man

477
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,810
Brilliant!

478
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,855
My utmost admiration for you. . .

479
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,023
Shut up!

480
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,445
Master! Over here!

481
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,076
Thank you!

482
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,414
Looking for me?

483
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,499
Get lost!

484
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,794
Nan, Master has been wounded

485
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,879
Attend to her inside

486
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,802
Ke, watch over him downstairs!

487
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,721
Bond, go on patrol

488
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,847
See if we're being followed

489
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,517
What about him. . .

490
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,811
I hit his vital points, he can't hear or talk

491
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,312
Don't worry!

492
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,817
I just want to tell you

493
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,902
I'm actually. . .

494
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,820
Get lost!

495
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,241
Minister Bond!

496
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,954
You're truly a man of all men

497
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,997
Even your vomiting is so stylish

498
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,166
Duo Long, what are you doing?

499
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,085
We came quick!

500
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,878
This is the only inn within a 1 0-mile radius

501
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,004
We came here for your rescue

502
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,005
I don't need your help!

503
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,674
I've gained the nun's confidence

504
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,843
I came with them because of her

505
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,762
Such distinguished taste! A nun!

506
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,305
I admire you

507
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,223
Admire my ass!

508
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,058
I'm after her pupil Li Ke

509
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,142
Did you bring my things?

510
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,937
Yes, including your favorite outfit

511
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,647
Smart lad! Your prospect looks good

512
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,733
Damn! Apple-polishing is my specialty!

513
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,285
You're too handsome

514
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,413
Sir, you look magnificent

515
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,458
Endless like the river

516
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,461
My utmost admiration

517
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,131
Forget your admiration

518
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:28,218
Sorry, Sir! I've prepared this for you

519
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,679
"Lustful Playboy"

520
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,431
"Wanton Grandma"

521
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,141
"Lascivious Bitch"

522
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,311
These 3 kinds of aphrodisiac. . .

523
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,478
Are the worst king

524
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,731
Watch this!

525
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,737
What is it?

526
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,364
Other than "Lecherous Slut"

527
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,409
"I Love Dicky" is the most effective

528
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,953
You can't even smell this stuff

529
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,829
So formidable?

530
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,747
Give it a try!

531
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,250
And you'll know

532
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,544
When it acts up

533
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,087
The victim will be extremely horny

534
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,714
When they see sticks or poles

535
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,257
They will chase after it persistently

536
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,217
No matter how much you resist

537
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,970
Taunt or even beat them

538
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,223
They will not give up

539
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,225
What's the remedy?

540
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:22,773
Just one spray

541
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,403
It appears to me there's no escape for Miss Ke

542
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,211
"Release me"

543
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,976
Please let me go!

544
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,271
I can't!

545
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,150
Then we'll elope!

546
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,529
How dare you!

547
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,532
This is from the bottom of my heart

548
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,368
When I saw you at Li Chun Brothel

549
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,661
It was love at first sight!

550
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,205
I didn't have the chance to tell you

551
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,332
Why are you marrying the Princess?

552
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,585
That was part of my father's plan

553
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,047
We overthrow the Manchus and he'll be King

554
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,507
I'll be the crowned Prince

555
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,718
My wife will be the crowned Princess

556
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,179
Or maybe Queen

557
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,307
That's none of my business

558
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,727
Don't you understand?

559
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,354
I only love you

560
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,233
Only you are fit to be my Queen

561
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,781
Is he pulling tricks again?

562
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,035
How could he?

563
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,202
That's true!

564
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,250
What's this?

565
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,087
Such ugly handwriting

566
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,174
Did your write this? You're in trouble!

567
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:12,716
He...

568
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,717
Tell me

569
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,761
What are those words?

570
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,056
"Don't move!"

571
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,432
I wrote it

572
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,104
You must be tired from standing

573
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,689
Let me fetch you a chair

574
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,732
Thanks

575
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,197
- Master. . .
- Yes?

576
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:36,907
Are you alright?

577
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:41,078
I'm fine. I cured myself already

578
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,789
I mean. . .are you alright?

579
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,957
Never mind that, you step outside

580
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,085
We have things to discuss

581
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,547
Stop!

582
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Yes, Master?

583
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,927
Are you sure we're not being followed?

584
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,595
I don't think so

585
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,847
- Go now!
- Yes!

586
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,106
What's the matter?

587
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,358
I used "I Love Dicky" on the nun by mistake

588
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,246
I'm dressed as a woman, why is she still after me?

589
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,998
Because you look like a dick!

590
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:27,749
Master!

591
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,417
Let's leave in this chaos!

592
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,131
You can't betray Master like this!

593
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,306
Come with me, I won't disappoint you

594
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,148
Come on!

595
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,484
Welcome, Master!

596
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,285
Release the Prince and Bond

597
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,499
Or else we'll move in

598
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,543
Who are they?

599
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,670
Never mind! Just hold them off!

600
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,721
Guards, stand down!

601
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,692
Go get Bond that bastard

602
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,152
Me again?

603
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,739
You look treacherous!

604
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,699
Is this what you think of me?

605
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,533
I'm righteous

606
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,411
I have utmost admiration for you

607
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,665
Undying like the surging flood

608
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,918
You traitor!

609
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,338
No! Better sacrifice one than both

610
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,797
At least I'll look after your grave

611
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,883
Look for the one responsible

612
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,218
Here's the one you want

613
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,097
Sissy, why are you dressed as a woman?

614
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,017
How dare you! Kneel before the Master!

615
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,437
No need to dressed like that

616
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,943
I told you I'll be back

617
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,784
Don't you recognize me?

618
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,745
Divine Lady of the Dragon Sect!

619
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,331
You! Plastic surgery?

620
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,461
This is the real me!

621
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,172
You're much better looking now

622
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,091
- Isn't she?
- Yes!

623
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,843
We're old friends, let's clear things up

624
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,053
Duo Long, let's go!

625
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,265
You 2 know each other, I don't

626
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:49,516
Master, excuse me!

627
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,977
You've gone too far!

628
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,895
No, just the usual!

629
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,857
Where are the Nun and the Prince?

630
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,359
I'm not the perpetrator

631
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,694
He's up there, go after him!

632
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,451
How enormous!

633
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,844
Shut up or I'll cut out your tongue!

634
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,972
That's my livelihood!

635
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,061
One more step I'll cut off your legs

636
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,443
You're after the Nun and me

637
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,320
Whose side are you on?

638
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,740
It's personal between us

639
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,702
You ruined my plan and tried to kill me!

640
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,082
The Emperor ordered the arrows, not me!

641
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,875
I'm not the perpetrator!

642
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,543
It's not my fault!

643
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,127
Come over here!

644
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,379
Coming!

645
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,507
What do you want?

646
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,800
Help me up!

647
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,514
- What are you doing?
- Helping you!

648
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:04,901
Smells nice!

649
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,531
No? Should I say you stink?

650
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,491
If you help me back to the Dragon Sect

651
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,535
I let you live

652
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,287
Thanks! Let's go!

653
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,669
I know

654
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,879
You're working for Wu San Gui

655
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,714
He is our benefactor

656
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,511
How do you know?

657
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,889
My master told me!

658
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,475
Maybe she's bullshitting you!

659
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,810
What do you mean?

660
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,853
I mean lying

661
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,479
Will you lie to your father?

662
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,147
Yes!

663
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,232
If there's any benefit

664
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,775
What if there is?

665
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,236
- Again and again!
- Bastard!

666
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,909
I'll get you in bed someday, bitch!

667
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,827
Impregnate you!

668
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,705
What? Walk faster!

669
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,875
Look at the skinny tiger!

670
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,460
No, it's a donkey!

671
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,838
No, it's a dog!

672
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,510
Where are you going? Go back!

673
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,388
Master, Prince Wu is here

674
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,934
With special Envoy Feng Xi Fan

675
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,810
Show them in!

676
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,525
Thanks for your help at the inn

677
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,110
So that I can escape from the Nun

678
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,321
They way you put it

679
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,907
Are you making fun of me?

680
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:17,909
Don't get me wrong!

681
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,911
My father will declare war soon

682
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,665
To thank your help in recruiting and

683
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,542
Training the troops

684
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,629
I'm here to offer you wine

685
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,298
And name you Divine Protector

686
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,050
Thanks, His Excellency!

687
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,760
Serve the wine!

688
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,185
Last time I was too busy

689
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,687
To accompany the Prince

690
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,188
Thanks for your help

691
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,356
Cheers

692
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,566
Thanks

693
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,610
Something fishy!

694
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,489
Good!

695
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:00,451
I heard the Dragon Sect's kung fu

696
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,245
Is invincible and unique

697
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,621
Is that true?

698
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,457
It's been exaggerated!

699
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,294
Tell me if you can

700
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,170
Resist the top poison

701
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,591
The invisible "Lecherous Slut"

702
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,552
What do you mean?

703
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,180
The Dragon Sect is getting out of hand

704
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,016
His Excellency wants you dead

705
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,603
And a clean sweep of your Sect

706
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,813
Guards! Arrest them!

707
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,530
You think you can win?

708
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,624
We have taken over before your return

709
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,376
Your followers have surrendered

710
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,880
Those who refused are killed

711
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,634
Long Er, I've searched high and low

712
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,510
And found the poison that'll break you

713
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,138
The wine is laced with "Lecherous Slut"

714
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,016
Do you feel hot now?

715
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,691
You must copulate with a man before dawn

716
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,444
Or you'll die from spitting blood

717
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,990
Perhaps I can help

718
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,283
I'll save you, Master!

719
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,668
Master, you're strong enough

720
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,086
Let me have the 80%

721
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,254
- You...
- It's a fact!

722
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,893
Be good! Please help me! Go!

723
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,903
Dragon Blood Escape!

724
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,926
I'll buy you a midnight snack

725
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,928
Let me help you! Are you alright?

726
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,930
I've used my last breath

727
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,557
To execute Dragon Blood Escape

728
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,600
The poison is acting up now

729
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:30,810
Let me rub your chest!

730
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,104
Don't touch me! Get lost!

731
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,439
Forget it!

732
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,607
I already told you

733
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,650
Everyone bullshits you

734
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,277
I'm the only one who didn't

735
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,486
You should thank me for it!

736
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,487
Don't go!

737
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:42,905
Now what?

738
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,532
Though he's annoying

739
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,159
At least he speaks the truth

740
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,578
Our Sect has been loyal to Wu San Gui

741
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,538
Yet he destroys us

742
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,840
Will I die here?

743
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,015
Jia Bao Yu?

744
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,231
Come over here!

745
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,567
Changed your mind again?

746
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,651
Just tell me what you want!

747
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,239
Come here quick!

748
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,908
Probably wants me to cure her

749
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,660
She's too kind to me!

750
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,710
Spider Woman!

751
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,765
Help!

752
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,077
Perhaps this is fate

753
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,871
If you disappoint me

754
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,499
I'll kill you!

755
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,928
- You awake?
- I didn't sleep

756
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,681
Bond, I'm yours now

757
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,016
I'll do as you tell me

758
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,018
Please pass me my pants

759
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,895
How obedient!

760
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,152
It's dawn already!

761
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,491
- Come here!
- Yes?

762
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,662
Everyone tells me

763
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,581
Wu San Gui is a hero

764
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,544
Now I know, heroes are not real

765
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,630
I know that now

766
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,174
You're so pretty!

767
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,304
I'm hungry! Let's get something to eat!

768
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,058
What's going on?

769
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,519
You've taken 80% of my power

770
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,229
You're invincible now!

771
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,566
Me? Invincible?

772
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,237
I must be a virgin to practice our kung fu

773
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,655
If I lose my virginity

774
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,742
80%  of my power will go to my man

775
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,912
I only have 20%  left

776
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,538
Really?

777
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,708
Do you mind if I punch you?

778
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,668
Just kidding!

779
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,503
After what happened last night

780
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,172
You're the King of the Dragon Sect

781
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,424
You must avenge our members

782
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,425
Against who?

783
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,302
Wu San Gui and Feng Xi Fan

784
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,221
I will go after them

785
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,905
Minister Bond. . .

786
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,907
Stop crying! Start talking?

787
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,824
Or else I'll kill you

788
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,871
Minister Bond is my only sworn brother

789
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:24,377
Our friendship is endless like the river

790
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,587
- That night...
- What about that night?

791
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,091
I fought off hundreds of men

792
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,218
But that bitch caught him

793
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,596
Grabbed his arms and legs

794
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,056
And pulled off his head

795
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,307
He's dead?

796
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:39,934
Yes!

797
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:48,859
I'm scared...

798
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:59,203
Really scared. . .

799
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,498
Princess, why the singing mood?

800
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,378
You won't understand. It's between me and Bond

801
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,634
It's alright, Princess

802
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,805
I'm willing to take over his women

803
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,727
Don't worry. Someone else will do it

804
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,520
You can go now!

805
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,147
Yes, Your Highness!

806
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,238
- Minister Duo!
- Rise!

807
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,489
Thank you, Sir!

808
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:40,327
I've prepared a dinner

809
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,580
I wish you and the Princess will come

810
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,249
I'm in no mood to eat since Bond is dead

811
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,084
- I'll take cash instead!
- Yes, Sir

812
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,755
He died bravely for the country

813
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,298
We must bury him in style

814
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,801
Prepare everything in gold

815
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,762
I'll find the best goldsmith

816
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,139
Save the trouble. Better cash it in!

817
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,641
Minister Bond loved beautiful women

818
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,185
In case he haunts me at in my dream

819
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,269
I'll need women to standby

820
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,438
Put 8-1 0 women in my bed

821
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,231
How considerate!

822
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,359
Minister Bond must be touched

823
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,322
Of course! But I'm a decent man

824
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,741
To sleep with so many women

825
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,576
Is more than I can manage

826
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,497
What's the matter with you?

827
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:28,834
Nothing!

828
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,713
I wonder when my wish will come true

829
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:36,801
My wish... come true

830
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,803
Duo Long, what have you done?

831
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:45,851
Wish come true...

832
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,694
Thank goodness, Minister Bond!

833
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,113
You're alive!

834
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,116
My wish come true!

835
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,451
With a friend like you, I hate to die

836
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,870
Of course!

837
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,580
You've been so loyal to me!

838
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,418
Since I turned you in that day

839
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,921
I laid awake in bed every night

840
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,132
And cried till dawn

841
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,175
I can only remember 2 words

842
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:22,221
I even tattooed them on my arm

843
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,473
That serious! Which 2 words?

844
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,225
See for yourself

845
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,228
"Take revenge"

846
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:30,980
That's right!

847
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,482
I can't tell if it is written correctly

848
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,483
It should be

849
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,485
I think about this day and night

850
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,361
What I must do for you

851
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,904
Is take revenge

852
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,365
You're still bleeding

853
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,409
Did you just tattoo them?

854
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,744
Of course not!

855
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,581
It bleeds every time I get excited

856
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,791
I'm excited to see you now

857
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,001
So it starts to bleed again!

858
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,628
Why are you holding a knife?

859
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:56,755
Why is there a knife?

860
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,591
Who put the knife in my hand?

861
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,969
You are my true friend indeed

862
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,971
I'm glad you're my sworn brother

863
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,806
I'm glad you think so

864
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,976
Let me tell you a secret

865
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,853
I can keep a secret

866
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,064
His Majesty sent me to
Tian Di Hui as undercover

867
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,567
To spy on Chen Jin Nan

868
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,819
According to my intelligence

869
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,280
They have branches across the country

870
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,407
Including one in Yunnan

871
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,533
Really?

872
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,285
That's why I want you

873
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,162
To do something for me

874
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,206
Me?

875
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,375
Shout the password in the market

876
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,878
Someone will take you to their branch

877
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,046
What password?

878
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,172
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

879
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,843
How can I say something so treacherous?

880
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,763
It's the only way to contact the rebels

881
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,182
I will also tattoo a code on your back

882
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,309
- Another one?
- Yes!

883
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,810
When you get inside

884
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,772
The one dressed as a courtier

885
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,981
Is Chen Jin Nan

886
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,566
Show him the code on your back

887
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,901
He'll give you something

888
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,945
- What is it?
- A secret!

889
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,282
Don't interrupt my song

890
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,450
Princess

891
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:28,931
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

892
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,478
What?

893
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,404
Tian Di Hui branch

894
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,364
That's too obvious!

895
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,623
Monkey knows about it too?

896
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,671
Bond is in Kunming!

897
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,465
He is cunning

898
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,175
Don't underestimate him

899
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:06,927
Father!

900
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,013
He insulted me repeatedly

901
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,891
I want him dead

902
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,353
You fool! He's the Imperial Envoy!

903
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,022
To kill him is to go against the Emperor

904
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,735
Our troops are not ready till next month

905
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,655
We cannot let a personal grudge mess up our plan

906
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,076
That's right!

907
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,494
When we attack the capital

908
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,204
Chopping him to pieces

909
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,831
Will be a piece of cake

910
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,333
Be patient!

911
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,335
Besides, you're marrying the Princess

912
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,795
Just humor her for the time being

913
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,923
Pretend to prepare for the wedding

914
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,633
Don't let Kang Xi sense

915
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,594
We're up to something

916
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,637
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

917
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,974
An emissary from Guangdong is here

918
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,309
To discuss the rebellion

919
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,269
I don't want too many people around

920
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,813
Dismiss the guards in the backyard

921
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,689
Yes, sir!

922
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,210
So flagrantly bold!

923
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,671
The door is open!

924
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,549
No wonder Tian Di Hui is
no match for the government

925
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:34,807
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

926
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,933
Who's speaking such nonsense?

927
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,519
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

928
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:39,978
Who is it?

929
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,068
Who are you?

930
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,321
He looks like a courtier!

931
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,239
Are you the undercover?

932
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:50,948
What's the code?

933
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,574
What code?

934
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,034
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

935
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,328
How dare you? Guards!

936
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:59,498
I have a code on my back

937
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,795
What? Overthrow Qing restore Ming!

938
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,339
Kill Wu San Gui?

939
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,218
Now you know who I am

940
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,886
I know your ass!

941
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,389
Bastard! I have the code!

942
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,724
How dare you hit back!

943
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,976
Guards! Catch the assassin!

944
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,186
How dare you hit me?

945
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,563
Assassin! Guards!

946
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,444
Arrest him!

947
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,112
Go to hell!

948
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,913
I dare you to fight me

949
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:40,747
Come on!

950
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,335
Aim to kill?

951
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,378
That's what happens to rebels!

952
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,963
Fix him good!

953
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,924
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

954
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,217
Your Excellency

955
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,761
The Princess has arrived,
accompanied by Minister Bond

956
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,774
I apologize for not welcoming you

957
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,401
Rise!

958
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,112
You'll be her father-in-law soon

959
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,363
Well...

960
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,616
What happened to your eye?

961
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,285
I bruised it accidentally

962
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,246
Summon Ying Xiong

963
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,998
Help!

964
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,460
Minister Bond, help!

965
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,003
Who are you?

966
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,714
I'm Duo Long

967
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,591
Duo Long is not as handsome as you

968
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,343
Take this rebel away!

969
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,093
Yes!

970
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,762
- Minister Bond. . .
- Of course

971
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,180
Remember we went whoring?

972
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,890
Are you really Duo Long?

973
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:40,766
Yes!

974
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,392
He barged into my mansion

975
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,268
And shouted the treacherous slogan

976
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,811
Overthrow Qing restore Ming

977
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,479
That makes him a rebel

978
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,272
But he really is Duo Long

979
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,650
Why did you beat up the envoy?

980
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,526
Yeah!

981
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,319
He's the envoy?

982
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:52,861
Yes!

983
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,112
I am indeed

984
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,322
Even so

985
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,449
That was a flagrant crime

986
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,451
But he's a Manchu

987
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,620
To overthrow Qing is against his kind!

988
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,412
Yeah!

989
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,373
Have you been framed?

990
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,543
Definitely! I've been framed!

991
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,418
How dare you accuse me?

992
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,628
Look at his back!

993
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:10,837
Let me see!

994
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,137
There's nothing! Just a bit dirty!

995
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,684
You wiped it!

996
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,978
It read Overthrow Qing restore Ming

997
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,062
Kill Wu San Gui

998
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,606
Are you accusing me now?

999
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,859
Bond, watch your manners!

1000
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:33,819
Yes!

1001
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,780
Let me make a judgment

1002
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,782
Please!

1003
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,910
Your Excellency is definitely. . .at fault!

1004
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,705
Duo Long is the Imperial Envoy

1005
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,958
He escorts me bearing the Imperial Sword

1006
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,543
If he should use

1007
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,546
The Imperial Sword

1008
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,089
Against Your Excellency

1009
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,593
Even I cannot save you!

1010
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,760
That's right!

1011
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,763
Who beat me up just now?

1012
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:02,472
Is that you?

1013
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:03,807
Take is easy!

1014
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,142
Did you beat me up?

1015
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,854
I'm not the perpetrator

1016
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,731
Kill the one who fixed you!

1017
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:14,818
Take it easy!

1018
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:15,944
I'll kill you

1019
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,531
Here's the Death Exemption Medal

1020
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,908
The Imperial Sword cannot kill me

1021
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,453
Father, remember the Medal?

1022
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,123
Death Exemption Medal?

1023
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:28,874
That's right!

1024
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,335
I almost forgot

1025
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:36,048
I dare you!

1026
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,550
Can I?

1027
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,177
Not if he has the medal

1028
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,262
But those who don't have it. . .

1029
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,683
Father, let me borrow the Medal

1030
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,101
Son...

1031
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,064
Give me! You can outrun him!

1032
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,815
No, you're the Lord!

1033
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,317
Give it to me!

1034
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,818
No! Give it to me!

1035
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:57,986
Give me!

1036
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,780
Stop! Who do you want me to kill?

1037
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,114
Give me!

1038
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,120
You don't have the Medal. I'll start with you!

1039
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:14,753
Give me!

1040
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,756
Here!

1041
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,301
Give it back!

1042
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,805
Where is it? Where's the Medal?

1043
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,473
In there!

1044
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,230
The Medal is here!

1045
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,526
Sorry!

1046
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:43,532
Are you alright?

1047
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,783
- Guards!
- Yes!

1048
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,827
- Help him inside to rest!
- Yes, Sir!

1049
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,666
I'll look after him

1050
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,921
- Everything is fine. You may go
- Yes!

1051
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,140
How are you?

1052
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,474
It hurts!

1053
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,560
Really? What should we do?

1054
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,228
Can I look?

1055
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,814
Maybe not

1056
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,233
Don't' be silly, we'll get married soon

1057
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,901
Let me take a look

1058
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,744
Take it easy! I have the Medal!

1059
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:29,828
Take it easy!

1060
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,414
Minister Duo, we all make mistakes

1061
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:33,415
You've already been beaten

1062
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,417
Let's settle with compensation!

1063
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,084
Fine

1064
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,210
Since you're not seriously injured

1065
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,754
How about 500,000 taels

1066
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:39,880
What?

1067
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,089
Forget it then!

1068
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,007
Please continue!

1069
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,551
Alright! I'll pay!

1070
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:55,771
The Imperial Jade Seal?

1071
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,356
I don't know

1072
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,152
Wu San Gui destined to rule,
usurp the throne at once

1073
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,780
Imperial Jade Seal is proof

1074
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,616
Your Excellency!

1075
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,992
I had nothing to do with this

1076
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,827
I've been framed

1077
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,329
I have no intention to rebel

1078
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,414
Sorry!

1079
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,631
- I'm scared!
- Son!

1080
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,715
Princess!

1081
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,010
Are you alright?

1082
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:27,677
What happened?

1083
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,846
He tried to rape me!

1084
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:33,642
I picked up a knife and cut it off

1085
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,520
Prince, you're so insensible!

1086
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,104
The Princess will be your wife soon

1087
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,606
Can't you wait?

1088
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,359
What should I tell His Majesty?

1089
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,069
I'm scared!

1090
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,113
- You!
- Good job!

1091
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:51,076
I learnt from you! I'm scared

1092
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:51,743
Guards!

1093
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,287
Sir?

1094
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,456
Escort the Princess to Phoenix Tower

1095
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,874
- Yes, Sir!
- I'm really scared

1096
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:02,879
It's bad luck, Minister Bond

1097
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,465
Pardon my poor hospitality

1098
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,341
I'm really scared!

1099
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,343
Such odd timing for everything to happen

1100
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,887
I wouldn't know how to deal with it

1101
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,138
Let's go

1102
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:17,394
I'm really scared!

1103
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,479
Sir! Young master has not waken

1104
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,898
- Summon Mr. Feng
- Yes, Sir!

1105
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,233
Alert the troops!

1106
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,150
Yes, Sir!

1107
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,319
Your Excellency!

1108
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,154
Is Ying Xiong alright?

1109
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,283
His genitals are seriously injured

1110
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,077
Propagation will be a problem

1111
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,373
Kang Xi, you Bastard

1112
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,918
You wanted to end my bloodline

1113
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,005
I want revenge!

1114
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,133
Order the troops to attack!

1115
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,470
Please stay calm! We're not ready

1116
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,223
Chances are slim if we declare war now

1117
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,893
Please wait 6 months. . .

1118
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,185
I said deploy the troops!

1119
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,271
Who's giving orders here?

1120
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,564
Sorry, Sir!

1121
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:08,111
Attack Phoenix Tower now!

1122
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,657
I'll tear Jian Ning and Bond to pieces

1123
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:21,124
Falling petals shadowing the moon. . .

1124
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,918
How poetic!

1125
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,961
Have some wine!

1126
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:35,805
What's on your mind?

1127
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,933
You're too suspicious!

1128
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,936
I just want you to meet some friends

1129
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:42,646
Long Er!

1130
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,537
You're into that! Don't touch me!

1131
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,748
No! She's a woman!

1132
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,584
We'll be family

1133
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:08,630
You're dreaming? What is she?

1134
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,925
She won't get half of my husband!

1135
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,301
Half is impossible!

1136
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,762
You only have a quarter! Shang Er!

1137
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,559
I knew there's something going on!

1138
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:24,020
It's common for a man to have 3 wives
and 4 concubines

1139
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,522
I only have 3 wives and 1 concubine

1140
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,565
That's extremely embarrassing!

1141
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,025
Not in your dreams!

1142
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,903
They will never be my equal!

1143
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:32,404
No way!

1144
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,197
Of course, they're not your equal

1145
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,324
They're the wives, you're the concubine

1146
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,076
When they sit, you must stand

1147
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,286
When we sleep, you pull the covers

1148
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,496
Go to hell!

1149
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,583
I told you not to hit my face!

1150
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,459
Damn your face!

1151
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,253
A concubine must not hit the master

1152
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,921
That's inappropriate

1153
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,383
Shang Er, teach her a lesson

1154
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,846
Stop! How dare you offend a Princess

1155
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:04,811
Fine! I'm bearing his child

1156
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,980
I dare you to hit me!

1157
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:11,234
Of course you can't hit my child

1158
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:12,777
Don't aim for the belly

1159
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,070
Aim for the chest!

1160
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,156
Help!

1161
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,032
What's the matter?

1162
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,743
Relax! Your faithful Duo Long is here!

1163
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:20,910
They're bullying me!

1164
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:25,457
This is Deadly Dragon Palm

1165
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,084
It'll leave your body in pieces

1166
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,503
If you wish, you can stand right there!

1167
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,380
I'll count to 3!

1168
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,465
Don't pay attention to her!

1169
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:36,468
1

1170
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,140
You're so agile!

1171
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,602
Will you be is concubine?

1172
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,187
Can I be his wife?

1173
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,315
Fine. We'll be sisters

1174
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,525
We're all sisters now

1175
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,528
I'll name you Scallop

1176
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,447
It's homonymic to "bearing son"

1177
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,240
What an awful name!

1178
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:00,867
What about abalone?

1179
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,952
Abalone? It's better!

1180
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,245
Early dinner?

1181
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,208
- Master!
- Master!

1182
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,878
I'd like you to meet

1183
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,255
Long Er of the Dragon Sect

1184
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,049
She has sided with us now!

1185
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,009
You know Shang Er

1186
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,554
That' Abalone! Have a seat!

1187
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,058
Feng Xi Fan has taken action

1188
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,267
He is extremely cunning

1189
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,560
His kung fu is comparable to mine

1190
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,561
You're no match for him!

1191
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,523
Who is he?

1192
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,108
I followed your orders

1193
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,277
Made a mess at Wu San Gui's mansion

1194
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,072
He probably can't wait to rebel now

1195
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,866
Yes! He'll attack Phoenix Tower tonight

1196
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:45,787
He wants to skin you alive!

1197
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,874
He's bluffing! I'm not afraid of him

1198
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,668
Duo Long, get me the fastest horse!

1199
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:52,502
I must excuse myself!

1200
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,671
They will mobilize the troops soon

1201
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,047
Princess Jian Ning

1202
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,507
They'll want you as hostage

1203
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:58,258
What shall we do?

1204
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,802
Leave Kunming at once

1205
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,388
Master, deploy us as you see fit!

1206
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,393
Bond, be careful!

1207
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,730
Watch for the child too

1208
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,441
I will take care of you both

1209
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:16,818
Go now!

1210
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,787
Take Long Er with you

1211
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:28,955
I'll stay behind

1212
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,624
- Master!
- You're smart

1213
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,043
In this troubled times

1214
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,254
If you don't covet after wealth

1215
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,463
You can overthrow the Qing regime

1216
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:39,048
And restore the Ming Dynasty

1217
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:40,884
That'll be the best

1218
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,761
One thing I still don't understand

1219
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:44,846
Say it!

1220
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:48,349
Kang Xi brought us peace and prosperity

1221
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,851
After Ao Bai's death

1222
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,519
People are content

1223
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,229
They are well fed and clothed

1224
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,315
Why must we overthrow him?

1225
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:56,816
Because it's my life long wish

1226
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:59,110
Really?

1227
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,407
We go to war because of your wish?

1228
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,867
Making everyone suffer

1229
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,327
That's a bit. . .

1230
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,786
There's no time to argue!

1231
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:11,497
Chen Jin Nan!

1232
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,125
You're behind the times!

1233
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,211
Feng Xi Fan! Back away!

1234
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,196
It's been a long time!

1235
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,530
You've become a running dog

1236
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,076
A rich man's dog is still better than a poor man

1237
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,577
Can't you understand?

1238
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:50,703
You're shameless!

1239
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,914
Lu He Formation!

1240
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:02,507
Your power has decreased

1241
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,967
Who did you pass it to?

1242
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:07,095
How dare you pick on her?

1243
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,559
What? Hula hoops?

1244
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,148
More? That's enough!

1245
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,196
Again? I'm not playing anymore!

1246
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,791
Can't be that formidable!

1247
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,752
What's the matter?

1248
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,546
Your power is scattered

1249
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,672
You can't use it properly

1250
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,051
So she passed it to you!

1251
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:48,136
Yes! So what?

1252
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,054
She's been injured, leave with her

1253
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,931
Master, can you manage?

1254
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:53,599
I can if you can

1255
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,226
That's true! I'm leaving!

1256
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:56,728
Sword formation!

1257
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,271
Lu He Formation!

1258
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,352
You bad-mouthed about me

1259
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,728
So that Master kicked me out

1260
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,772
This is your retribution

1261
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,065
I should have killed you then

1262
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,108
I was too kind to let you go

1263
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,694
You can only blame your stupidity

1264
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:29,404
You lost!

1265
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,197
Cut the crap and just kill me!

1266
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,532
Of course not

1267
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,367
You're my ticket to fame and fortune!

1268
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,206
Be careful!

1269
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,333
Long Er, hold on!

1270
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,171
How are you?

1271
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:48,965
I'm fine

1272
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,969
It's just flesh wound

1273
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:54,762
Don't be so sad!

1274
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,100
Emotional is always my shortcoming

1275
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,936
Don't be silly! That's not true

1276
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,355
You have other virtues

1277
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,399
Don't be silly! I only have one virtue!

1278
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:14,031
I'd like some notice before you show up!

1279
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,408
I already made a noise!

1280
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,576
Didn't you hear me?

1281
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,911
Bond, this is...

1282
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,622
Long Er is my wife now

1283
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,294
You have subdued her?

1284
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,881
It's too complicated for a nun to understand

1285
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,843
You are unfathomable indeed

1286
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:35,678
How did you arrest them?

1287
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,141
Wu San Gui was too busy deploying the troops

1288
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,225
Security was loose

1289
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,020
She was hiding inside the mansion

1290
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,813
So I abducted both of them

1291
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:48,149
I also found a copy of 42 Chapters

1292
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:50,735
42 Chapters?

1293
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:53,070
Let's hide it

1294
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,781
This is crucial to our plan in
toppling the Qing regime

1295
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:56,866
Thank you

1296
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:59,160
What about them?

1297
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,623
What should we do with them?

1298
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,876
They should die for what they did

1299
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:10,213
If you're willing to redeem yourself

1300
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,673
I can give you a chance...

1301
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:13,799
Thank you, Minister Bond

1302
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,759
. . .to die first

1303
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,346
- Kill him!
- Please spare me!

1304
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:19,722
We'll die together

1305
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,891
That's your decision! I didn't say that

1306
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:24,602
Please spare my pitiful life!

1307
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,937
I'll be your slave!

1308
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:27,522
You don't have to be afraid

1309
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:29,982
You promised we'll be together!

1310
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:32,902
I was just kidding. Don't be so serious!

1311
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,488
How can you say that?

1312
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,697
I'm almost an eunuch

1313
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,824
You don't need me! Leave me alone!

1314
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,704
Please don't cry!

1315
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:44,830
Get lost, you bastard!

1316
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,708
How can you say that?

1317
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,920
You still won't appreciate what I've done for you

1318
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,547
He treats you like dirt and yet. . .

1319
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,923
Is this what you want?

1320
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,551
Bond, what are you saying?

1321
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,803
Nothing! Come with me

1322
01:15:58,804 --> 01:15:59,679
Wait on my wife in the day time

1323
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,596
Wait on me at night

1324
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,810
You're lucky he'll take you in

1325
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,187
Or else I'll kill you

1326
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,939
You should thank him

1327
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,774
That's right, you should thank him!

1328
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,234
Thank you for not killing me

1329
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,735
Thank you for cleaning up my mess

1330
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:15,611
You are impudent!

1331
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,074
- Shameless!
- Good job!

1332
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:20,950
You too!

1333
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,081
I feel hurt when you're in pain

1334
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,005
You've cheated another girl!

1335
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,716
It' a living! Don't be too harsh on me!

1336
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,467
Your generosity is much appreciated

1337
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,555
Your Majesty!

1338
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:45,308
Rise! Bond, come quick!

1339
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:46,726
Thank you

1340
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:49,979
I missed you!

1341
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,105
Are you quite well?

1342
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,773
I'm fine, thank you!

1343
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,233
You have something to tell me?

1344
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:54,900
Yes!

1345
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,029
Wu San Gui is plotting a rebellion

1346
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,197
You should issue a decree to punish him

1347
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,783
Finish him off before he mobilizes the troops

1348
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,954
I have deployed my troops 2 days ago

1349
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,498
Wise decision, Your Majesty!

1350
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:10,708
I am deeply impressed

1351
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,918
In case you're wondering how I know

1352
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:13,836
Of course

1353
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:16,339
I'd like you to meet a new colleague

1354
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,716
You 2 can help me rule

1355
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:19,425
Who is it?

1356
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,140
You bastard!

1357
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,683
Watch your mouth, Bond!

1358
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:33,814
Duke Bond is outspoken by temperament

1359
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:37,276
Using vulgar language is quite common

1360
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:39,695
- You...
- Duke Bond

1361
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,656
Now that we're colleagues

1362
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,950
Please forgive and forget the past

1363
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,996
What did you do to my Master?

1364
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,208
See this 2nd rank outfit?

1365
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:54,043
You turned him over to the Emperor!

1366
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,088
Feng Xi Fan has submitted

1367
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:57,838
Wu San Gui's plans

1368
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:00,549
And captured Chen Jin Nan

1369
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:01,884
That's a great service

1370
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,053
You 2 should get along fine

1371
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:06,055
- Yes!
- Of course!

1372
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:09,767
Bond

1373
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,728
You've been accused of being a member
of Tian Di Hui

1374
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:14,855
I have been worried ever since

1375
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,191
To clear your name

1376
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,860
You will oversee Chen's execution

1377
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:23,447
Then no one will suspect

1378
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:24,907
You're related to him

1379
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,118
What do you think?

1380
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,536
I appreciate your consideration

1381
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:31,288
Thank you!

1382
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,719
Ever since he returned from the Palace

1383
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,636
He's laden with anxiety

1384
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:46,637
I wonder why?

1385
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:48,681
We don't know either

1386
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,517
He loves you, do you know?

1387
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,520
He didn't tell me

1388
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:56,939
I've bathed him since he was a child

1389
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,733
I know everything about him

1390
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,818
He can't fool me

1391
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:01,902
What is it then?

1392
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:05,656
I don't know

1393
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,201
I have been invincible so far

1394
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,036
But now, I have no confidence

1395
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:14,415
You had the Emperor's support

1396
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:18,043
But now he trusts Feng Xi Fan

1397
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,212
How can you have confidence?

1398
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:28,512
These 42 Chapters?

1399
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:30,347
I still can't find the secret

1400
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,393
Burn them!

1401
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:39,607
Why?

1402
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,316
I want to

1403
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,610
Her Highness is here!

1404
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:47,865
Your Highness!

1405
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:50,951
Your Highness

1406
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:51,744
Rise!

1407
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,330
You can leave now!

1408
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:55,873
Yes!

1409
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:02,046
Hello, sisters!

1410
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,131
Sister-in-law, how are you!

1411
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:06,008
- Good girl!
- Master!

1412
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,426
Something wrong?

1413
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:08,219
Yes!

1414
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,055
My brother ordered the Banner leaders to watch you

1415
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,098
And besiege this place on his order

1416
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:14,683
You must be careful

1417
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,185
Must be Feng Xi Fan's ploy

1418
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:17,895
What's burning?

1419
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:21,899
There are words!

1420
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,988
East. . .you read it!

1421
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,699
- Invincible East?
- Is come?

1422
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,867
It's Eastern Tomb

1423
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,914
These words are fire resistant!

1424
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,791
The secret is at the tomb?

1425
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:41,460
I have a plan

1426
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,798
Your Majesty!

1427
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:49,760
What can I do for you?

1428
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:53,305
I have a bit of a cough

1429
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,724
I want to go hunting tomorrow

1430
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,726
Would you like to join me?

1431
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:00,396
Yes, I will protect Your Majesty

1432
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,064
Good! Guards!

1433
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,067
Award the Imperial Sword

1434
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,489
Thank you

1435
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:12,491
A sword for a general

1436
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:14,034
Please remember

1437
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,662
Do not unsheathe the sword rashly

1438
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,497
Or it'll draw blood

1439
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:19,748
Yes, Your Majesty

1440
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,210
I'll see you tomorrow

1441
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:24,378
I'll take my leave now

1442
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,104
It's my fault that you're suffering

1443
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,940
No! I underestimated him

1444
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,612
Rest assured, before your execution

1445
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,573
I will kill Feng Xi Fan

1446
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,159
You're no match for him!

1447
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:57,244
I have 80%  of Long Er's power

1448
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,037
Besides

1449
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,955
But you can't control the power

1450
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,583
With the Lu He Kids

1451
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,001
He's invincible

1452
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:05,544
I'll take my chances

1453
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,297
Good for you!

1454
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,798
Come over here!

1455
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:13,928
Master, what are you doing?

1456
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:00,391
There's nobody here!

1457
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:02,768
Feng Xi Fan, you've been had!

1458
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,062
I dare you to show your face!

1459
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,397
Be a man and come out!

1460
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,107
I've been waiting!

1461
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,203
You gained a woman's power

1462
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:23,664
Now you've become a sissy!

1463
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,791
Don't you like it?

1464
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,211
I'm sewing a pair of underwear for you!

1465
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,134
See how mean you are!

1466
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,385
Won't even clothe them properly!

1467
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:38,303
Come, let me help you!

1468
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:50,816
Lu He Formation!

1469
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:52,943
Golden Snake Hand?

1470
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,758
Lu He Kids eat shit?

1471
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:17,843
How fitting?

1472
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:24,349
I had reservations about you

1473
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,727
But now I have the Imperial Sword

1474
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,562
You'll be sorry

1475
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,110
I'll go find the Emperor

1476
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,613
Here I am

1477
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:38,906
Your Majesty?

1478
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,283
I want to go hunting tomorrow

1479
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,827
Would you like to join me?

1480
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:45,412
It was you!

1481
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:46,997
That's right!

1482
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:55,089
Our paths don't cross

1483
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,341
Yet you keep pushing me

1484
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,552
You double-crossing bastard

1485
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,388
I want to avenge my Master

1486
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,474
Lu He Power

1487
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:17,027
Wrong pose!

1488
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:18,362
Sorry!

1489
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,404
I'm go play hula hoops

1490
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:20,823
You take a break

1491
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,542
Lu He Palm

1492
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,229
Wonderful

1493
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,773
Your power has increased!

1494
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,192
Are you scared?

1495
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,574
Bond, you're my only hope

1496
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:05,868
I have taught you everything

1497
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,496
You'll head up Tian Di Hui for me

1498
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,418
If I don't come fully equipped

1499
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:15,627
How can I kill you?

1500
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:19,548
You've went through a lot of trouble

1501
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,300
And used the Princess to trap me

1502
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:22,676
I'm afraid it'll all go to waste

1503
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:24,011
Soul Changing formation!

1504
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,692
Dragon Hand

1505
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:40,861
I pinch!

1506
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:54,041
Pinch!

1507
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,042
No reaction?

1508
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:56,835
Do it again! I like it!

1509
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:58,921
Shameless!

1510
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,589
Soft Debone Palm

1511
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,557
Done! Let's go

1512
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,392
Lu He formation!

1513
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:18,148
Bond, needles and thread

1514
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:30,702
Ice Palm

1515
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:31,828
I got it!

1516
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,676
Have a taste of your own medicine

1517
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:31,138
Bond!

1518
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,350
Are you alright?

1519
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,362
Can't believe it's so easy!

1520
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,740
The Manchu treasure

1521
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:51,241
Has become gold sand

1522
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,869
Rumor said it's hidden outside the frontier

1523
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,370
But it's hidden within the capital

1524
01:28:57,373 --> 01:28:58,457
This is an underground tomb

1525
01:28:58,791 --> 01:28:59,458
Tomb?

1526
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:00,292
Eastern Tomb?

1527
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,419
The secret of the 42 Chapters

1528
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,087
The Dragon Wall was specially designed

1529
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,298
It's our fengshui wall

1530
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:07,966
Let's stop fighting

1531
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,426
And split the gold

1532
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:12,137
This is what we're fighting for

1533
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,097
A handful of this is a lot already

1534
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:15,599
Let's forget it!

1535
01:29:15,808 --> 01:29:17,100
You're right!

1536
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,101
- Well?
- Why not?

1537
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,272
I knew you'd do that!

1538
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,080
He stepped on something

1539
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:38,872
A trap!

1540
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,127
Run!

1541
01:29:58,559 --> 01:29:59,267
You're bleeding!

1542
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,602
Yes, but he's in deeper shit

1543
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,107
Why is he stabbing himself?

1544
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:07,818
To stimulate himself

1545
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:09,653
Shutting off the vital veins

1546
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:11,363
To fully utilize his latent energy

1547
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:12,489
Really?

1548
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,204
This is a serious blow

1549
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:20,747
You must give your best to block him

1550
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,399
Bond!

1551
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,664
Are you alright?

1552
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:06,042
Stab me on the head with needles

1553
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:08,962
I want to use my latent energy

1554
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:10,505
I don't know his method

1555
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:12,299
But there's another way

1556
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,301
With the same effect?

1557
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,510
How?

1558
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:16,803
Pain!

1559
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:18,180
Pain?

1560
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,975
I'll stab the most painful pressure points

1561
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:23,852
Don't scream

1562
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,396
Hold it in till the last moment

1563
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:27,397
Then. . .

1564
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:29,232
Use my clog

1565
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:30,233
Thanks!

1566
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:32,360
Armpit

1567
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:36,907
Spine

1568
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:41,745
Big toe

1569
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,668
Let it out!

1570
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:57,219
It hurts!

1571
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,445
His latent energy is amazing!

1572
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:17,405
Bond, you won!

1573
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,169
These jewels and gold are harmful

1574
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:32,671
So many people died for them

1575
01:32:35,424 --> 01:32:36,841
To rectify the situation

1576
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,469
I'll keep them

1577
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:41,721
Bond, destroy the Dragon Wall

1578
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:43,682
And end the Qing regime

1579
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,610
But why?

1580
01:32:56,362 --> 01:32:57,946
Under Kang Xi, people are wealthy

1581
01:32:57,947 --> 01:32:58,697
They all go to school

1582
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,073
Is that so bad?

1583
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:04,953
I don't care who's the Emperor

1584
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,288
As long as he's a good Emperor

1585
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,081
Right, Long Er?

1586
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:11,209
Perhaps

1587
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:14,045
Let's move his body to the execution ground

1588
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:14,963
Or else it'll be too late

1589
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:43,700
Stay away!

1590
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:49,914
Behead him!

1591
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:02,177
What's taking so long?

1592
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:04,429
Here they come!

1593
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:12,270
Master!

1594
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:14,564
So good to see you!

1595
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:16,232
I always knew

1596
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:17,859
You're a good pupil

1597
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,987
It's getting late, let's go!

1598
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,323
If the Emperor finds out about the swap

1599
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:24,199
We'll be in trouble

1600
01:34:25,117 --> 01:34:27,952
His Majesty is here!

1601
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:32,123
Put that away!

1602
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:34,668
Let me talk to him!

1603
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:38,129
Your Majesty!

1604
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:40,423
How dare you kill my courtier

1605
01:34:40,549 --> 01:34:42,092
And kidnap the prisoner?

1606
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:45,720
Duo Long!

1607
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,516
You're right! I betrayed you again!

1608
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:51,142
You haven't changed a bit

1609
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,769
Yes!

1610
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:57,565
Frankly, Your Majesty

1611
01:34:58,442 --> 01:35:00,568
I have supreme power now

1612
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:01,778
None of your people

1613
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,947
Can stop me from doing anything?

1614
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:05,198
Anything?

1615
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:07,742
Including killing you

1616
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:10,995
But I can't find a reason

1617
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,707
To kill a beloved Emperor like you

1618
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:16,459
Will you be so generous

1619
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,044
And go easy on me and my family?

1620
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:20,171
Please let us go!

1621
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:28,096
- Rise!
- Thank you!

1622
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:32,058
Again?

1623
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:36,646
I've heard about your supreme power

1624
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:39,649
I just want proof

1625
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,444
You are indeed tougher than before

1626
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:48,450
I have killed the rebel Bond

1627
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:52,203
His accomplices have fled

1628
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:55,749
He no longer exists

1629
01:35:58,627 --> 01:35:59,961
Be good to Jian Ning

1630
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,547
Thanks for the Imperial squeeze!

1631
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,966
- Don't let anyone bully her!
- Yes!

1632
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:06,926
We'll always be good friends!

1633
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:07,761
I agree!

1634
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:09,387
- Take care!
- Bye!

1635
01:36:12,975 --> 01:36:13,892
Bye!

1636
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:26,696
I bluffed him! My dear wives. . .

1637
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:27,697
Let's go!

1638
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:46,007
Don't care about right or wrong

1639
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:52,555
My legend will pass on via songs

1640
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,018
Don't care about right or wrong

1641
01:36:57,269 --> 01:37:00,438
All I want is to have fun

1642
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,274
Don't are what's mine and what's not

1643
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,819
Just be happy

1644
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,907
Be happy when you can

1645
01:37:11,116 --> 01:37:14,369
Have fun when you can

1646
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:17,705
Everything is just a game

1647
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:21,292
Life is just a game

1648
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:27,048
Whether it's true or false

1649
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:29,467
It's just a play

1650
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,554
Such a waste

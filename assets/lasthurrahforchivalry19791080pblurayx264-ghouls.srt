1
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,336
Tonight's the kind of night
that's worth having that extra drink!

2
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,796
Oh right, have you seen the bride yet?

3
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,547
Not yet.

4
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,925
But I think she's got to be more beautiful
than my wife!

5
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,430
Apparently the bride
hails from a prestigious family.

6
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,517
Hey now, how could she be a match for our
Lord Kao if she was just any old peasant?

7
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,604
Young Master Kao and his dad
are actually complete opposites!

8
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,688
How are they different?

9
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,524
The senior Lord Kao made his name
using his fists.

10
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,401
Young Master Kao's martial arts isn't bad.

11
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:12,943
Right.

12
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,236
But he likes to study.

13
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,489
He says, "Only with a head of knowledge
can you get ahead in life."

14
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,741
Is that how it is?

15
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,161
We don't have any book smarts,
that's why we're not going places.

16
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:22,953
Really?

17
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,163
I don't think so.

18
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,498
A scholarly man
isn't necessarily a good man.

19
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,708
Is that right?

20
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,755
Ah! May be all that studying he's doing
is for use in the bedroom.

21
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,174
Oh, then he must really be something!

22
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:37,968
Congratulations, my lord!

23
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,347
Congratulations! Congratulations!

24
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,640
Congratulations! Congratulations!

25
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:44,558
Hey!

26
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,187
My honoured seniors.

27
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,188
My good friends.

28
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,398
I drink to you all.

29
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:53,692
Cheers!

30
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,282
Youngest nephew, a drink.

31
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,622
Back in the day,
your old man and I fought...

32
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,290
108 battles together, right?

33
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,876
Youngest nephew,
you really have a good memory!

34
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:11,877
Cheers!

35
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:12,544
After you.

36
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,764
- Amazing! Amazing!
- Fantastic! Wonderful! Wonderful! Great!

37
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:29,520
Truly... in the heart of a youth...
lies that of a hero.

38
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:34,358
He's just like his old man: full of guts!

39
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,487
Taking such a beautiful wife.

40
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,156
Even if it brings ruin to your family,
it's still a good deal.

41
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,118
My Lord, your wife's as pretty as a picture!

42
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,579
I'm not ashamed to tell you that
she is the famed rose of the Drunken Red.

43
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,956
Huh? Isn't the Drunken Red...

44
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,040
A brothel?

45
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,750
I don't believe it.

46
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,088
- Of the so called famed roses I've bedded,
eight out of ten were as ugly as pigs!

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,882
She is the only one
whose talent and beauty stands out.

48
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,510
That's why I bought her freedom
with 1,000 taels.

49
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:04,096
Doesn't the young mistress hail
from a prestigious family?

50
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,889
I have to keep up appearances.

51
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,558
You said it right:

52
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,185
"A scholarly man
isn't necessarily a good man."

53
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,188
Dear husband.

54
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,064
Dear wife.

55
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,833
Pai Chung-Tang?!

56
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,502
The senior Lord Kao's sworn enemy?!

57
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,296
My lord, be careful.

58
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,557
How could it be
that on the occasion of Lord Kao's wedding,

59
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,101
that even I, Pai Chung-Tang,
have not been invited?

60
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,604
It was my youthful negligence.

61
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,396
My apologies.

62
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,983
The Kao Villa
is so renowned throughout the land.

63
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,486
And we have arrived
completely out of the blue.

64
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,989
It is only proper
that we bring a small token of goodwill.

65
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,299
What a truly thoughtful gift.

66
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,094
Is it too little, or is it too much?

67
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,429
If it's not enough, there's more!

68
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:30,349
My lord!

69
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,975
I've got his sword!

70
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,187
Protect his lordship!

71
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,076
I have always loved you... trusted you!

72
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,539
But the money Pai Chung-Tang gave me
was even more than you!

73
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,208
With 1,000 taels you could buy her freedom.

74
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:59,336
But with 2,000 taels,
I could get her to kill you.

75
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,424
A whore by any other name.

76
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,101
Kao Peng!

77
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,853
Three years ago...

78
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,981
Your dad stole
this mountain fortress from me!

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,941
I swore an oath on my life:

80
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,025
I will have revenge!

81
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,235
How presumptuous!

82
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,529
Leave him to me!

83
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:45,716
Protect his lordship!

84
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,048
Take the young master and get out of here!

85
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,309
You two protect his lordship!

86
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,311
My lord! My lord! We need to go!

87
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,187
Let's go! My lord!

88
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:22,896
I want revenge!

89
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,314
I want revenge!

90
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:27,818
- I want revenge!
- My lord!

91
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,777
I want rev-

92
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,586
Big brother, just about
everyone in Kao Villa has been *Kccch!*

93
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,591
I want Kao Villa...

94
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,510
Devoid of all life!

95
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,859
I want... I want...

96
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,194
I want... I want...

97
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,529
Revenge...

98
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,281
I want revenge!

99
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,829
You have to rest properly for a few days.

100
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,123
If you do not, your wounds will re-open.

101
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,916
You will easily bleed to death.

102
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,878
Grandmaster! I...

103
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,136
Save this breath.

104
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,096
To have revenge...

105
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,432
You must rely on this breath!

106
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,195
I believe that I can kill Pai Chung-Tang.

107
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,905
You are definitely not his opponent.

108
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,325
We can hire and recruit warriors!

109
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,917
A true warrior of unparalleled skill
is not found with money.

110
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,294
Grandmaster...

111
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,675
You've helped me once already,
so you might as well help me again.

112
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:15,467
Grandmaster.

113
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,179
How can I find
a true warrior of unparalleled skill?

114
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:29,481
If your heart is consumed by vengeance,
your wounds will only worsen.

115
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,568
But... the loss of my family...

116
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,072
...causes me more suffering than any wound.

117
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,954
There is a young man:

118
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,123
Chang San the Divine Blade.

119
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,251
I think he can defeat Pai Chung-Tang.

120
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,177
A bit cruel, don't you think?

121
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,142
Can you see the two bite marks
on the chicken's arse?

122
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,768
Wha-What bite marks?

123
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,229
They must've been left by a Chinese cobra!

124
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,692
The chicken's full of snake venom.

125
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,027
If you eat it,
you'll bleed from all eight orifices!

126
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,028
Bleed from eight orifices?

127
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,488
Isn't it just seven?

128
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,656
Where's the eighth one?

129
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,199
Where you take a shit!

130
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,663
I bet the King of Hell's gonna have you
reincarnate as a chicken!

131
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,790
If I was smart, I wouldn't eat this chicken.

132
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,416
Right.

133
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,252
You little bastard!
Your mum'll gonna be a chicken!

134
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,087
- How dare you try and eat my chicken!
- Hey! Don't fight! Don't fight!

135
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:34,504
I'll kill you!

136
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,298
- Hey! Steal my chicken, huh?
- Hey, don't fight here!

137
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,132
Give it back!

138
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,925
Hey! Hey! Come back!

139
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:39,968
Give me my chicken!

140
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:40,719
Hey! Hey! Over here!

141
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,928
Hey, give it back!

142
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,140
If you don't give it back,
I'll kill you!

143
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,850
Don't pick on kids!

144
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,268
So what if I do?

145
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,772
If you do, there'll be someone
who doesn't like what they see.

146
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,609
Do you know who I-

147
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,489
I don't care who they hell you are!

148
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,616
In this town I've got money,
and I've got respect!

149
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,450
You've got money?

150
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,308
Let's go buy a bird.

151
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,018
Are we gonna look for a lady?

152
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,062
The kind of bird you can eat!

153
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:35,690
Still wanna fight?

154
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,484
Some... some other time.

155
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,490
I washed eight horses today.

156
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,200
The total is 8 candareens.

157
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,246
Here, 8 candareens.

158
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,570
Distinguished sir, come in and have a seat.

159
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,196
The ladies we have here are very beautiful!

160
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,427
Please don't stop.

161
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,517
You can come inside.

162
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,020
I don't have enough silver and taels.

163
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,483
There's nobody around right now.

164
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,319
It will be really easy
if you want to come in.

165
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:02,986
No way.

166
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,155
It doesn't cost anything out here.

167
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,782
I only want to hear you play the zither.

168
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,311
Thank you.

169
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,647
And another freak.

170
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,607
I'm not the only one.

171
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,525
There's a few more down there.

172
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,693
Three of them.

173
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,987
They've been following me all day.

174
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,324
Being followed...
Could be good, could be bad.

175
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,243
I assume it's probably something bad.

176
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,537
How ominous.

177
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,170
This one time,
these three kids were always following me.

178
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,672
Over mountains and over ridges.

179
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,091
They followed me everywhere,
it pissed me off.

180
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,425
What happened in the end?

181
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,219
In the end, I had a good look at them.

182
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,596
Their three faces looked exactly like mine!

183
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,682
And then they even called me dad.

184
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,352
Turns out they were bastard kids
I left behind somewhere sometime.

185
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,861
Are you alright?

186
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,739
The character for "Fortune"
hangs over my head.

187
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,241
How could anything go wrong?

188
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,120
I sleep when I'm full.

189
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,955
I eat when I've slept.

190
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,375
And when I make some money...

191
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,459
...I go drinking.

192
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,254
You sure know how to live the good life.

193
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,297
Oh, no!

194
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,757
Mother's waiting for her medicine!

195
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,771
If I say I'll come, I'll come.

196
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,941
You also said if you're not coming,
you're not coming.

197
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,498
Aside from killing...

198
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,294
...I know there's nothing else
you care about.

199
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,129
Perhaps.

200
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,174
Be careful.

201
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,302
You can cut your hand like that.

202
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,722
You have to be careful too.

203
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,475
Or you might end up cutting yourself.

204
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,813
When I'm coming, I come by myself.

205
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,607
When going, I go by myself.

206
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,692
When it comes to other people...

207
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,652
...I have no relationships with anybody.

208
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,407
You know...

209
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,952
That I am your only friend.

210
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,329
Friend?

211
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,962
In this line of work...

212
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,090
...you have to even kill friends sometimes.

213
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,257
I know you won't.

214
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,969
If not, how come you've had
such rotten luck all your life?

215
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,055
Do you have any more wine? Huh?

216
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,770
- You're a first rate swordsman,
but a second-rate killer.

217
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,106
If you killed the wrong person...

218
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,233
... you wouldn't be able
to live with yourself.

219
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,442
If you don't kill...

220
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,029
... you'll live a drunk, and die a dreamer.

221
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,950
Are you this long-winded to all the guests?

222
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,083
To other people...

223
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,962
...I don't say a single word from the heart.

224
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,970
Is there any more wine?

225
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,097
No!

226
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,059
There's only me.

227
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,379
Now that's good wine.

228
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,844
But it tastes a bit of incense and ash.

229
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,264
Go sleep hugging the wine pot then!

230
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,237
Go brew the medicine first.

231
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:08,708
Don't worry.

232
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,252
Mother will get better in no time.

233
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,963
What's the matter then?

234
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,220
Promise me that you won't get mad
after I tell you.

235
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,430
Alright, I won't.

236
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,431
Tell me.

237
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,309
It's because of him!

238
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,518
Chuan?

239
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,230
Did he hit you?

240
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:30,939
No.

241
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,774
What did he do then?!

242
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,777
He said he won't marry me!

243
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,242
- I don't believe this!
- What are you doing?

244
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,202
- I don't believe this!
- Don't be like this!

245
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,079
You said you wouldn't get mad!

246
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,497
Don't worry!

247
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,249
There's no way you won't get married!

248
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,541
- Older brother!!
- Chuan!

249
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,085
- Older brother!
- Come back here!

250
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,586
Don't be like this!

251
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,508
Chuan, open the door now!

252
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,509
Come out!

253
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,385
Open the door!

254
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,553
I... I'm sick!

255
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,054
Sick?!

256
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,139
If you're sick,
how come your voice is still fine?!

257
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,349
I don't believe it!

258
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,689
Why won't you marry my sister?!

259
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:13,690
I...

260
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,361
So my sister isn't pretty enough?!

261
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,572
She's pretty,
and you can say she's easy on the eyes!

262
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,158
Have you ever loved her?!

263
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,703
When you put it that way,
I guess there is something there--

264
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,585
Why haven't you married her yet then?
Out with it!

265
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,255
I've given it a lot of thought, except... but...

266
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,214
But what?!

267
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,427
But she...
but she's got such a fierce brother.

268
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,679
How could I dare marry her?!

269
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,055
Fine!

270
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:47,807
I'm not fierce!

271
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,601
If there's something, just say it.

272
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,603
I'm poor!

273
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:57,025
I made a vow that if I can't make money,
I won't take a wife!

274
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,445
There's love between a man and wife!

275
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,240
Even if all you have to eat is water,
you'll still be full!

276
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,369
If you have enough money,
then you also have respect!

277
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,586
I want my wife
to be able to live comfortably!

278
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,381
This is what it means to be a real man!

279
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,091
Bullshit!
Are you marrying my sister or not?!

280
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,217
Older brother, stop fighting!

281
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,510
Help me. Please help me.

282
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,850
Older brother, please stop beating him!

283
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:31,476
I beg you!

284
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,393
Stay out of this!

285
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:32,977
Get out of the way!

286
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,687
Older brother, stop beating him!

287
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,481
He's about to break!

288
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,153
San!

289
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,405
You're fighting again?!

290
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,157
I'm not!

291
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:47,909
It's not my fault!

292
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,202
He fell down by himself!

293
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:51,913
Oh, dear!

294
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,414
Just look at yourself!

295
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,375
How'd you get so dirty just falling down?

296
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,876
Your eye's all swollen too!

297
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,212
M-My arm!

298
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:00,463
Your arm...?

299
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:01,214
My arm!

300
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,548
Oh yeah, it's dislocated!

301
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:05,927
I...!

302
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,686
Mother, don't get angry.

303
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:16,979
Sit down first.

304
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,608
Ah! Let me check if the medicine is ready.

305
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,985
I've always told you to not get into fights.

306
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,363
Why do you have to be so disobedient?!

307
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:25,863
I know!

308
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:26,697
I know!

309
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,367
The medicine should be good to drink now.

310
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,034
Drink it.

311
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:31,828
Get up.

312
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,541
Do you want to be my wife?

313
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,418
Then hurry up and boil some water.

314
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,419
I need to bathe!

315
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,294
Alright.

316
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,381
The water can't be too cold or too hot!

317
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,048
Alright.

318
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:46,759
Grandmaster.

319
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,720
I know you have the Moon Shadow Sword.

320
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,222
Would you be able to...?

321
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,182
You are not yet worthy!

322
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,311
I carry an indignation
that demands absolute retribution.

323
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,105
How can that make me unworthy?!

324
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,068
The bravery of fools,

325
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,529
brings the downfall of a kingdom.

326
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,906
With an unjust heart,

327
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,492
a sword can only do evil.

328
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,079
Grandmaster.

329
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,541
To wield the Moon Shadow Sword,

330
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,002
I have more than enough reason and worth.

331
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:24,755
Grandmaster.

332
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,010
I beg you to bestow the sword to me!

333
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,803
Until you have cultivated your mind,

334
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,681
trained your heart to be free of all evil.

335
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:37,018
When using a sword
becomes the same as using your heart.

336
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,521
Only then will I consider bestowing the
Moon Shadow Sword to you!

337
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,732
Grandmaster!

338
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,863
Grandmaster, I only want the sword!

339
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,781
My lord!

340
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,658
Grandmaster!

341
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,537
Grandmaster, give the sword to me!

342
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,581
Grandmaster, I can't wait any longer!

343
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,291
I must have my revenge!

344
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,847
I'm begging you.

345
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,891
Why beg others, when you can beg yourself?

346
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,392
Why beg others...

347
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,230
...when you can beg... yourself...

348
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,899
Eh, excuse me.?

349
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,484
Please wait a moment.

350
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,569
Oh, it's a tail chasing dog.

351
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,865
Our lord wants to introduce himself.

352
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:38,663
Please.

353
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:46,546
Please have a seat.

354
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,380
This is fine.

355
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,506
Humblest greetings.

356
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,049
My surname is Kao.

357
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,592
Given name is Peng.

358
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,553
I really admire you.

359
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,890
If fate has it we meet again,
I will return your hospitality then.

360
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,186
When we'll meet again,

361
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:03,980
We'll never know.

362
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:08,025
Why not use this opportunity
to get to know each other?

363
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,735
Strangers conversing like old acquaintances.

364
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,406
I drink to you.

365
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:14,699
Let us be friends.

366
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,702
How refreshingly brisk.

367
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:46,772
Get out of the way!

368
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,648
Out of the way!

369
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,026
The money?

370
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,112
You'll get it in your next life.

371
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:41,494
Get down!

372
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:55,758
Let's go! Go!

373
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:00,221
Well?

374
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:00,596
Anything?

375
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,222
Nothing!

376
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,391
Split up and look again!

377
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:15,861
You're injured.

378
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,613
Unbelievable!

379
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,491
He said I'd get 100 taels if I rescued him.

380
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,575
My dad used to say:

381
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,537
"It's better to trust a whore
than to trust a gentleman."

382
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,038
This is some rotten luck.

383
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,418
I feel like we've met somewhere before.

384
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,252
Think about it.

385
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,630
I'm drawing a blank.

386
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:44,890
Hey, buddy!

387
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,684
Have you seen the fugitive?

388
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,936
You touched my blade.

389
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:49,937
And?

390
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,480
Did it get bent or something?

391
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,898
You touched my blade.

392
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,193
Who are you, kid?!

393
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,571
An Tien-Ming.
(Accept one's fate)

394
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,781
Whoever touches my blade...

395
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,033
...must accept one's fate.

396
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:33,731
Where is your blade?

397
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,525
Stored away.

398
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:38,819
It's gone rusty?

399
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,746
It is said...

400
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,541
Defeat Chang San the Divine Blade,

401
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,920
and one can seal away their blade,
and live a life of seclusion.

402
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,546
Because under heaven,

403
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,091
there will never again
be another king of the blade.

404
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,348
Chang San the Divine Blade
is not what they say he is.

405
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,812
If I had a blade in hand...

406
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,564
... you would also have to accept one's fate.

407
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:20,194
Then we'll have to see
whose life is more valuable.

408
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,118
Chang San!

409
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,279
At long last...

410
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,950
The chance to battle the Divine Blade
and see who is superior.

411
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:28,637
Chang San!

412
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,055
You coward!

413
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:38,731
My friend.

414
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:42,860
I have no friends.

415
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,112
Such skill with a blade.

416
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,697
I want to buy it.

417
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,158
Not for sale.

418
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,576
What about you then?

419
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,329
I think...

420
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,873
You won't be able to afford my price.

421
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,042
What about... 1,000 taels?

422
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,047
1,000 taels...

423
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,091
That'll be enough for me
to buy 1,000 women.

424
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,930
If you're worth 1,000 taels,
then Chang San is worth 10,000 taels.

425
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,766
Comparing your skill with a blade to his:

426
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,476
You're not even close!

427
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,857
When I've defeated Chang San...

428
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,610
Then you'll know how much I'm worth.

429
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:25,361
My friend.

430
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,531
There is a way
you can still make 10,000 taels.

431
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,088
I'll consider it.

432
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:00,604
- Brother Chang!
- It's you!

433
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:01,814
How is auntie faring?

434
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,360
Auntie.

435
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,030
Auntie, please get plenty of rest.

436
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,125
These are the finest medicinal herbs.

437
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,626
Go and have them cooked.

438
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,669
It's too late.

439
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:29,883
We've only met once before.

440
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,469
Why bring such an expensive gift?

441
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,349
When it comes to friends,
treat them as your own.

442
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,600
Auntie's illness...

443
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,272
How can I stand by and do nothing?

444
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:55,784
The re leaving soon.
yr

445
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:56,243
Where is he?

446
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:56,994
Over there.

447
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,709
We'll gather all our brothers tomorrow
and rob the bank!

448
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:04,084
Great!

449
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:05,961
Hey! Cheers! Cheers!

450
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,629
Bring the wine over.

451
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,468
Why are you so badly injured?!

452
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,969
Wouldn't be the first time.

453
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,805
I'll do it myself.

454
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:34,990
Promise me...

455
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,577
This will be the last time you kill.

456
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,956
Once there has been a first time...

457
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,917
...there can be no last time.

458
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:48,879
No single person...

459
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,548
...is forever destined for failure.

460
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,096
Only after I've accomplished
something beautiful...

461
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,349
...I will give it up.

462
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,607
There is someone
who really cares about you.

463
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,277
She is willing to give up everything...

464
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,406
...to have a family to call her own.

465
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,495
You can love anyone you want.

466
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,499
But don't fall in love with a drifter.

467
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,383
Where are my 100 taels?

468
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,385
I spent it all.

469
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,930
You're not good with promises.

470
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,725
It's just how I've always done things.

471
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,520
It's also why you won't live a long life.

472
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,248
Despite our best efforts...

473
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:49,708
Auntie,

474
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,419
Must have a fine funeral!

475
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,129
Understood.

476
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,983
Why hasn't brother Wang arrived yet?

477
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,120
Who are you?!

478
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:28,997
In such a hurry.

479
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,458
Rushing off to see your dad to hell?

480
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,618
This money here...

481
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:10,122
Take it and start a small business,
set yourselves up.

482
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:40,152
Ancestral Sword Master Chen Kuan-Wu,
why don't you use your sword?

483
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,612
Beating a dog doesn't require a sword!

484
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:48,887
Brother Chang.

485
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,473
How about you come with me?

486
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:56,228
Coming here will be just like
going back to your own home.

487
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,229
My lord, look!

488
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,111
Could it be that
- Pai Chung Tang's men were here?!

489
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:06,530
Grandmaster!

490
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:09,825
Brother Wang!

491
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,203
Grandmaster!

492
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,835
Grandmaster, who did this?

493
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,134
I... I forbid... you to avenge me...!

494
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,687
It's him!

495
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,188
I'll find him!

496
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,939
Wait!

497
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,609
This happened because of me.

498
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,694
I should be the one to go.

499
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:46,319
You can't!

500
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,280
They all died for me.

501
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,073
I will see to this personally!

502
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,163
Stay here and
take good care of the grandmaster.

503
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:57,456
Brother Chang...

504
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,624
What if...

505
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,085
You can rest easy.

506
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,880
People like An Tien-Ming...

507
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,884
I can't even remember how many
of his kind I've beaten before.

508
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,262
Besides, I've got nothing left to lose anymore.

509
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,036
It's still such a fine blade!

510
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,290
What are you doing?!

511
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,791
Hey! What are you doing?!

512
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,419
Trying out the blade!

513
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:51,426
Ah, this is bad!

514
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,010
Gone!

515
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:52,844
Ah, it's gone!

516
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:53,678
A fine blade!

517
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,474
You're always messing up my store!

518
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,227
Don't think I won't get rid of your sister!

519
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,771
If you ever bully my sister,

520
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,899
You'll never have a good day again
for the rest of your life!

521
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,735
Why me?!

522
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:10,779
Everything's broken.

523
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,406
Older brother, are you leaving?

524
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,784
I'm coming back.

525
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:17,577
And when I'm back,

526
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,038
I'll have a lot of money.

527
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:23,875
I'll even be carried home on a litter
by a hundred men!

528
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,804
If I lose...

529
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,182
Please look the other way...

530
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,685
...and spare my friend.

531
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:44,646
Don't worry.

532
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,774
After I've defeated
Chang San the Divine Blade,

533
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,361
I'll retire to the country
and live a pastoral life.

534
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:37,480
I really have to retire to the country...
live a pastoral life...

535
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,285
I should have known from the start...

536
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:52,996
It was a conspiracy...!

537
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,502
I have never known... An Tien-Ming...

538
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,089
How could he know that this is where I live?

539
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,011
Why did he bait me to unsheath my sword?!

540
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,890
Someone is plotting against me!

541
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,976
Grandmaster, you suspect me?

542
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,645
But I am your most filial grand-pupil.

543
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,815
There is so much about you...

544
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,110
...I don't know even know...

545
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:26,821
My lord.

546
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:30,658
Chang San has already returned.

547
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:34,787
Brother Chang...!

548
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:41,044
Between the two of us,

549
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,420
all debts are paid.

550
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:48,009
Brother Chang unleashing his blade
is equal to having saved my life.

551
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,221
If you weren't there to help bury my mother,

552
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,265
your friends would still be alive today.

553
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,392
Brother Chang's sense of loyalty
is so apparent.

554
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,436
Like a shadow cast in the sun.

555
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,777
With his level of skill,

556
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,738
Chang San is more than capable
of handling Pai Chung-Tang.

557
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:09,489
Maybe.

558
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:12,867
To be so strongly
governed by your emotions:

559
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:14,243
it is a fatal weakness.

560
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:20,917
- Hurry up!
- Alright!

561
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,168
Here is good.

562
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:23,503
Hey, find a bigger table for us to sit at!

563
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:24,003
That one!

564
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,047
Bring the wine.

565
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,091
But do you still have money?

566
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:28,925
Nope.

567
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:30,843
But you know what to do.

568
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,845
Just give to us for now.

569
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,472
Drink the rainwater!

570
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:35,723
It's free!

571
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:38,434
Here!

572
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,103
Bring me the finest wine!

573
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,523
Right away! Right away!

574
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:44,899
- Brother San.
- Hey!

575
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,693
- Hey!
- Hey! Brother San!

576
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:49,862
- Hey! Brother San!
- Brother San!

577
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,114
- Why're you so well dressed?

578
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,782
- Wow!
- Nice clothes!

579
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,242
- You look completely different!
- So nice!

580
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,160
Hey, brother San.
Did you marry a wealthy widow?

581
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,203
Of course!

582
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,371
Wine's here! Wine's here!

583
00:49:58,705 --> 00:49:59,789
Hey! Hey!

584
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,418
- Hey, I want wine too!
- Give me some wine!

585
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:08,715
No taking breaths in between.

586
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,133
What about taking a piss?

587
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,050
Nope.

588
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:44,667
Hey! Hey! Hey!

589
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,378
- No slacking off. Drink!
- No slacking off!

590
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:48,796
I'm in!

591
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,965
Place your bets. All bets are final!

592
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:52,717
Place your bets! Place your bets!
Place your bets!

593
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,010
Bet big and win big!

594
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,928
Place your bets! Place your bets!

595
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,263
Bet big and you'll win!

596
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,473
Place your bets! Place your bets!

597
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,682
All bets are final!

598
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:00,975
We're off!

599
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:01,851
Oh, no!

600
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,561
Four-five-six, straight kill! Banker wins!

601
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:45,770
I'm borrowing this.

602
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:46,562
Sure.

603
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:48,689
Hey!

604
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:53,069
Bet! Bet! Bet!

605
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,654
Bet big and win big!

606
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,030
Place your bets! Place your bets!

607
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:57,240
All bets are final!

608
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:57,865
We're off!

609
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,660
Four-five-six, straight kill! Banker wins!

610
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,745
Straight kill! Straight kill!

611
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,548
Fucking kid, who are you?!

612
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,173
Don't move!

613
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,134
- Surround him!
- Surround him!

614
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:16,676
Over there!

615
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,515
No wonder every game is four-five-six.

616
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,475
Con me will you?!

617
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,954
Hey now, no fighting.

618
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:51,586
With the exception of my mum,
nobody is allowed to con me!

619
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,090
Even your mum would con you?

620
00:52:56,549 --> 00:53:00,344
She said my old man was a 72nd generation
grandchild of Emperor Ming of Tang.

621
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,221
You've got a pretty good ancestry then.

622
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:02,930
Hell no!

623
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,224
I've got 72 dads more like it!

624
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:06,726
So you're actually a bastard!

625
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:07,977
So what if I'm a bastard?!

626
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,605
Too bad one of my dads is the emperor!

627
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,109
Whatever you say, emperor boy.

628
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,493
You two... Who are you with?!

629
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,704
- And who are you with?
- And who are you with?

630
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,914
- I'm one of Pai Chung Tang's.

631
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:31,167
- Oh! Pai Chung-Tang.
- Oh! Pai Chung-Tang.

632
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:34,045
I've heard his wife is
50-something years old and still a virgin.

633
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,088
I think he's an arse bandit more like.

634
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:48,893
Big brother San!

635
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,937
- We're coming to help!
- We're coming!

636
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,897
Wow! It's really pouring!

637
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,050
I'm done playing.

638
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,268
I'm called Chang San (Anonymous)

639
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:33,771
You wouldn't happen to be
called Li Ssu (Incognito) would you?

640
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,608
Just call me Ching I (Green Clothes).

641
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,917
B-Big brother is the b-best!

642
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,377
G-G-Great kung fu!

643
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:02,883
- Big brother is amazing! The best!
- The best! The best!

644
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,848
All of you listen up!

645
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,976
Train your mind and spirit like mine!

646
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:13,394
Come out and train!

647
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,862
The four of you get out here!

648
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:23,779
Get out here!

649
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,869
C'mon boss, you're lucky to get chosen.

650
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,330
If you're not going to hell,
who's going to hell?

651
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,373
Help us out here. Help us out!

652
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:42,631
Report...

653
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:44,967
We've got something to report, big brother!

654
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,469
Tell me after the fight!

655
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:48,804
Attack me!

656
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,350
Attack me!

657
00:56:02,902 --> 00:56:03,736
Make your move!

658
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:11,160
Big brother, these two
will need a coffin real soon.

659
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,247
Get them to talk before closing the lid!

660
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,332
Coffin's still open till you talk.

661
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:20,628
Big brother, some guys
busted up our gambling den!

662
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,422
All our brothers have been beaten...

663
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,550
...black and blue...!

664
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:30,596
Who did this?!

665
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,227
One was called Chang San...
One was called Ching I...

666
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:41,690
This is not happening!

667
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,003
G-G-Good job! Big brother is the best!
The best!

668
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,257
Big brother... Have a rest.

669
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:07,049
Get lost!

670
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,052
Here big brother, have some wine.

671
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,721
What's the deal with those two kids?

672
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:13,305
Oh!

673
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,224
One is called Ching I the Life Taker.

674
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,935
He's the worst killer in all the land.

675
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,063
What about that Chang... whatever it is?

676
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:21,897
Chang...?

677
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,232
Oh!

678
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,109
Chang San the Divine Blade!

679
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,236
Apparently he's a friend of Kao Peng.

680
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:31,282
His Rusted Blade has already taken the lives
of all kings of the blade under heaven.

681
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,825
Furthermore, his skill
with a blade is truly...

682
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,119
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

683
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,413
- Is he really that skilled?!
- Kill! Kill!

684
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,664
Just average.

685
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,007
That fucking bastard Kao Peng...

686
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,426
I should've killed him
with my blade long ago.

687
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:51,177
Kill him.

688
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,392
Big brother, should we...
quickly send someone to kill him?

689
00:57:58,476 --> 00:57:59,018
No!

690
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,770
I'll wait for them to come to me!

691
00:58:01,854 --> 00:58:04,398
I managed to reclaim my mountain fortress
with just one hand!

692
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,192
I'm not scared of some brats!

693
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:11,947
My lord!

694
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,283
Don't... Don't do this!

695
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,410
Y-You... You mustn't do this!

696
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:17,828
My lord!

697
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:24,251
Why did he...?

698
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,214
My lord may have been too eager for revenge.

699
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:29,465
Overcome with grief...

700
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,384
He just couldn't take it anymore... so...

701
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:33,928
Brother Kao.

702
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,430
How did things come to this?

703
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,186
Affection is...
the affection of a father and a mother...

704
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:48,108
Vengeance...
is the vengeance of a sea of blood...

705
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:54,907
For each day... that I have not
killed Pai Chung-Tang...

706
00:58:56,408 --> 00:59:02,248
I am not worthy... to face
those with whom I share this world...

707
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,126
Pai Chung-Tang is really
such a tough opponent?

708
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,965
Never has... he met his match...

709
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:17,555
My lord...

710
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:21,183
My lord... how do you feel?

711
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,733
As long as you, brother Kao,
stop trying to take your own life,

712
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:32,069
I will kill Pai Chung-Tang in your place!

713
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:32,861
Brother Chang!

714
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,989
This is my burden to bear!

715
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:38,701
Your burdens...

716
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:40,578
...are my burdens.

717
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,122
What's more...

718
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,792
This is the first time
someone has thought so highly of me.

719
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:47,501
Brother Chang...

720
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,431
I am born because of my father and mother.

721
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:04,852
I am saved because of... my friend.

722
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:09,648
Brother Chang!

723
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:12,276
Be careful...

724
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:32,421
You are waiting for something.

725
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,922
What are you waiting for?

726
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,925
When I used to do deeds,

727
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,886
I wouldn't even think twice.

728
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,555
But this time...

729
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,683
This time... your mind wanders
and you cannot make a decision?

730
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:45,809
You can stop deciding.

731
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:47,686
Just go.

732
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:57,488
The whole world knows that you're
fighting Pai Chung Tai for Kao Peng's sake.

733
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,280
Such loyalty!

734
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:02,743
You know too.

735
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,707
They're waiting for you.

736
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,880
This is even more exciting
than attending a grand banquet.

737
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,633
If I were you,
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

738
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:24,932
Perhaps...

739
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:26,684
Life and death...

740
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,894
...aren't very important.

741
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,653
Before I kill...

742
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,115
...I always break out in a cold sweat.

743
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,243
If I don't drink some wine...

744
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,745
...I'll freeze to death from the cold sweat.

745
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,584
Don't just get caught up drinking!

746
01:01:58,924 --> 01:01:59,299
Now.

747
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,094
You have to know yourself,
and know those around you,

748
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:05,305
in order to claim a hundred victories
from a hundred battles.

749
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,015
This is Pai Villa.

750
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:10,352
There are thirty-six warriors
surrounding it from all sides.

751
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,607
The main gate. It's guarded by the
Yellow Weasel and the Phantom Spear.

752
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,735
The two of them might be pushovers,

753
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,821
but we still need to be on guard;
even ants can swarm an elephant to death.

754
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,157
Have you seen the
deadly Spirit Reaper before?

755
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:32,583
In order to defeat this lot,
the two of us have to work together.

756
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,500
Us?

757
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,252
The two of us?!

758
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,006
What if something
unfortunate happens to you?

759
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,091
Who likes drinking with a dead man?

760
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:01,361
Mad Blade of the Sleeping Buddha.

761
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,781
His skill with a blade is inexplicable,
comes and goes like a phantasm.

762
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,532
How come you know everything in such detail?

763
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,576
I like poking my nose into things.

764
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:12,915
But the toughest one to beat...

765
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:14,625
...is Pai Chung-Tang.

766
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:41,610
You must...

767
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,946
...be wary of his final move.

768
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,492
Final move?

769
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,958
Even I don't know what it is.

770
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,760
You're such a resourceful fellow,
but even you couldn't find out.

771
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:13,851
Just remember...

772
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,478
Be wary of his final move.

773
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,234
Let's not dwell on today or tomorrow.

774
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,069
We still have wine to finish!

775
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,571
Let's save it for tomorrow!

776
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,490
I will keep the wine warm.

777
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,076
And I will wait for you to return tomorrow.

778
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:08,113
My lord, Chang San and Ching I
have already set off.

779
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,782
I expected nothing less.

780
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:15,704
My lord, we should send our men
and coordinate the attack with them.

781
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,624
Let us wait and see for the time the being.

782
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:20,250
Wait and see?!

783
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,461
If you want someone dead...

784
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,465
You don't have to hold the knife yourself.

785
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,484
Damn it!

786
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,195
I was hoping to live till 60.

787
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,197
Why not hope for 100?

788
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,741
Supposedly once you're over 60,

789
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,953
you grow weak in the arms and legs,
and feeble in the mind.

790
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:58,455
You can't do anything
even if you see a pretty girl.

791
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,332
60 sounds about right.

792
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,711
A real man is
unflinching in the face of death.

793
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:08,090
Sometimes... real men aren't worth a dime.

794
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:16,974
Where is everyone?

795
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:17,933
There's ghosts.

796
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:22,604
Even three-year-olds know
these two coffins aren't for dead people.

797
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,181
The ghost king waves his fan.

798
01:06:58,265 --> 01:06:58,598
Go!

799
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,494
All the ghosts have disappeared.

800
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:23,040
Be careful of ghosts tapping on
the back of your head.

801
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:26,668
Clever move.

802
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:32,215
What are you doing?

803
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:32,799
Nothing.

804
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,760
Just checking if you have a chin.

805
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:39,681
It's the dead of night, so it's hard to tell
if someone's a human or a ghost.

806
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:47,689
C'mon boss, stop messing around!

807
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:56,907
Watch out!

808
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,700
The Phantom Spear has no eyes.

809
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,270
Any ideas on how to stop ghosts?

810
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:28,772
Have them fight each other.

811
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,570
How come you suck more than a ghost?!

812
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,402
Do you fancy your life being too long?

813
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,362
I'm not afraid of dying unlike you.

814
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,365
I've always only been afraid of two things:

815
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,742
One, dying tragically. Two, dying drunk.

816
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,871
Dying drunk seems
really straightforward though.

817
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,290
There are many different kinds of dying.

818
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,543
Dying inexplicably, without any idea of
the why and how wouldn't be worthwhile.

819
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,171
If you're going to die, die with some worth.

820
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,592
Hey! Why haven't we seen Pai Chung-Tang?

821
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,635
Yeah, get him to come outside... idiot.

822
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:52,606
One final sweep?

823
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:21,384
Let's go!

824
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:31,853
Ching I!

825
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:26,241
Hey! Are you alright?

826
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,245
Not dead yet, right?

827
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,373
I think I'm almost done.

828
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,136
Boss!

829
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,972
If you like fooling around so much,
why don't you make a living from it?

830
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,016
My mum fools around for a living!

831
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:27,552
Hey.

832
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,456
Good game!

833
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:25,712
Tell me, for my last move of the game...
what kind of move should I make?

834
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,881
Hire some men to do it.

835
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:31,050
And you can sit here and reap
the benefits of their work.

836
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:31,759
Right.

837
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:35,138
Hurry and up and fetch the men.

838
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,228
Why are you still here?

839
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:48,693
The senior Lord Kao used to conduct himself
in way that is completely different to you.

840
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:54,407
He was a righteous man
who would take matters into his own hands.

841
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:57,619
That's how he became the
number one boss throughout the land.

842
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,163
His generation has passed.

843
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:03,583
You are my subordinate, are you not?!

844
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,546
I have my own ways.

845
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,758
If I say this is how something goes,
you are in no position to talk back!

846
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:12,759
Do you understand?

847
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,807
It's no wonder your master once said:

848
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,976
"There is so much about you...

849
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,604
...that I don't even know."

850
01:15:35,073 --> 01:15:35,907
There's nobody here.

851
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:51,005
Hey!

852
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:52,840
We're on the same side!

853
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:58,179
But I'm certain I saw something
on your back just now.

854
01:15:58,263 --> 01:15:58,680
What?

855
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:04,519
No there's not!

856
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:08,690
What am I, a hunchback?

857
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,127
On his back like a dead snake.

858
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,545
Sleeping Buddha of the Blade.

859
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,922
His body sleeps,
but his mind is wide awake.

860
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:34,090
He's not so tough!

861
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:33,441
He woke up.

862
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,777
He's gone from Sleeping Buddha
to Swollen Buddha.

863
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,278
I'm not so scared now.

864
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:51,477
Is he dead yet?

865
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,020
It's hard to say.

866
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,482
His dead face is about the same
as his sleeping one.

867
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,465
Save it!

868
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,388
It's more comfortable over there.

869
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:36,494
How can this old geezer be so fierce?

870
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:37,536
We can't die here.

871
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,706
We're in a hurry to go back drinking.

872
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:28,045
Attack his throat!

873
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,217
Sulphur solution?!

874
01:26:32,313 --> 01:26:34,607
You're... You're not kidding around are you?

875
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:37,735
Kidding around...

876
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:40,446
Now is not the time.

877
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:41,780
Why?

878
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,408
Kao Peng gave me 500 taels.

879
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:47,411
Told me to bring back your head.

880
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:49,079
Kao Peng?

881
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:51,999
When you are useful...

882
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:53,876
...you are his friend.

883
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,378
When your usefulness is up...

884
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,006
...you are nothing but trash.

885
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:01,175
Is this...

886
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:03,510
...what the final move is?

887
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,932
I told you right from the start to be wary.

888
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,267
When it comes to my friends...

889
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:12,228
...I am never ever wary.

890
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:15,940
This is why you and I...

891
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:17,775
...are destined for failure.

892
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,196
Will there be...

893
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:23,864
...another move?

894
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:24,740
Yes!

895
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:27,409
A third move. A fourth move.

896
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,872
When it comes to friendship
there are just too many moves.

897
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,333
You just...

898
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,835
...can't defend against them all.

899
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,275
Where's the sword?!

900
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,652
I always knew you were plotting something!

901
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,051
Where's the sword?

902
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:28,345
My sword...

903
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,806
...is only for those of noble character!

904
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:32,099
My character...

905
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,476
...is not something for you to judge!

906
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,728
Where's the sword?

907
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:39,189
The sword is not something you can see!

908
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:40,441
You have eyes...

909
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,901
...but you may as well have none!

910
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:44,236
You have a heart...

911
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:46,739
...but you may as well have none!

912
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:29,865
Give me back the sword!

913
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:30,574
You...!

914
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:32,034
Give me back my sword!

915
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:02,356
Grandmaster would never fully recover.

916
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,151
Weary of his existence,
he took his own life.

917
01:30:19,373 --> 01:30:22,209
And here I thought I found
someone else like me.

918
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:27,673
In the end it was just another dream.

919
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:28,757
Dreams...

920
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,593
Usually nothing comes from them.

921
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:39,393
So it's just like my love for you?

922
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,480
I've told you before...

923
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,900
Don't fall in love with a drifter.

924
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,485
In your world...

925
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,822
...there is only life and death.

926
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:54,700
It is cold.

927
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:56,952
But there is no warmth.

928
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:00,789
There are pursuits.

929
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,668
But nothing comes from them.

930
01:31:06,295 --> 01:31:08,964
I'm not the kind of person
who likes to dream.

931
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:09,631
Because...

932
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:14,052
...I'm always very aware
of what it is I'm doing.

933
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:14,720
Older brother...

934
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:17,723
You said that when you came back,

935
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,934
You'll be carried home on a litter
by a hundred men.

936
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,060
Who would have thought...

937
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:36,241
What is it?

938
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,165
Chang San is already dead.

939
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,214
Help me tie my sash.

940
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,886
Are you a cripple?!

941
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:01,642
Yes.

942
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,520
I have already become numb.

943
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:07,147
To you.

944
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,150
To your so-called vengeance and indignation.

945
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:13,028
The truth is...

946
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,866
Everything has been for the sake
of furthering your own ambitions!

947
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,368
Through underhanded means no less!

948
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:36,969
Master!

949
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:38,679
Did you know,

950
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:40,639
that the creation of a hero...

951
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,225
...requires many people to die.

952
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:46,186
I only know that in your dad's generation,

953
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:48,564
people spoke of promises...

954
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:50,816
...and of real loyalty!

955
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:57,906
Truth be told, his Kao Villa was plundered
by killing and pillaging all the same.

956
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:01,910
Once a person has achieved success,

957
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:06,915
even past acts of killing and pillaging
can be retold as the deeds of a hero.

958
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,709
Besides...

959
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:13,755
Eventually I will become the great hero
of the second generation of Chungyuan!

960
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:15,257
Look at them.

961
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,719
All of them are kneeling there
so faithfully.

962
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:22,973
Except for just a handful of them...

963
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:24,975
The re bought and paid for!
yr

964
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:28,228
Aside from following me
you have no other way forward!

965
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:30,897
The deeper I understand you...

966
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:35,110
...the further away from you I need to go.

967
01:33:35,694 --> 01:33:36,737
You should know:

968
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:39,990
Submit to me and prosper,
oppose me and perish!

969
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,993
First you sacrificed our
Kao Villa brothers.

970
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:45,495
And then there was brother Wang.

971
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:46,496
Grandmaster.

972
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:48,123
Chang San.

973
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:51,376
You won't even spare a fly!

974
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,505
I order you to stay!

975
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:59,217
You have no need for friends at all!

976
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:20,405
My brothers.

977
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,574
Let us help one another.

978
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:25,202
When I your lord revive Kao Villa,

979
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,079
the fortunes that we make
will be shared equally by all of us.

980
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,289
The land that we claim
will be lived on equally by all of us.

981
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:31,166
Thank you, master!

982
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,178
I see you've kept your promise.

983
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:31,810
When talking business,
there's only the language of promises.

984
01:35:32,561 --> 01:35:33,061
That's right!

985
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,024
Where's my 500 taels?

986
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:41,528
The words of a gentleman are never empty.

987
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:43,989
Come and get it.

988
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,490
The way I see it...

989
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:47,492
Shouldn't we keep some distance between us?

990
01:35:56,293 --> 01:35:56,835
Stop!

991
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,312
You probably don't know
the rules of our trade.

992
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,646
Killing for a job:

993
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:18,273
Kill with a single cut.

994
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:19,649
Those who don't keep promises:

995
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:21,485
Kill with 1,000 cuts.

996
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:30,118
I also have a rule of the trade:

997
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:32,329
If I want you to die...

998
01:36:33,038 --> 01:36:34,414
You will have to die.

999
01:38:03,503 --> 01:38:04,212
Kao Peng!

1000
01:38:04,963 --> 01:38:05,672
This move...

1001
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,424
Even you couldn't anticipate it!

1002
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:08,675
Truly...

1003
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,053
Truly a master stroke.

1004
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:24,524
In this world, true friends do exist!

1005
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,193
Will there be...

1006
01:38:28,028 --> 01:38:28,904
...another move?

1007
01:38:29,446 --> 01:38:30,030
Yes.

1008
01:38:31,865 --> 01:38:32,991
A third move.

1009
01:38:34,326 --> 01:38:35,452
A fourth move.

1010
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:39,247
When it comes to friendship...

1011
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:41,875
...there are just too many moves.

1012
01:38:43,919 --> 01:38:44,711
You just...

1013
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,088
...can't defend against them all.

1014
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:57,098
I think there's one thing you overlooked:

1015
01:38:57,891 --> 01:39:00,727
I've never managed
to wrap up any of my jobs.

1016
01:39:01,728 --> 01:39:02,354
That's why...

1017
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,314
... you'll always be unlucky!

1018
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:04,981
That's right.

1019
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:07,067
It's cos I met you.

1020
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:15,158
I underestimated the two of you.

1021
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:18,662
And I used to overestimate you!

1022
01:39:19,663 --> 01:39:20,413
Yes...

1023
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,542
I deserve to be put on a pedestal.

1024
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,003
Because I am superior to all!

1025
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,132
Why don't you lock yourself up
in a birdcage then?

THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT

2
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:31,209
Written by

3
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:39,167
Featuring

4
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:48,209
Music

5
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:48,417
Director of photography

6
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:54,042
Directed by

7
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:59,459
Forward! After me!

8
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:10,459
We take you prisoner!
Don't try to resist.

9
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,292
Hey! Do you hear me?

10
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,501
Just a minute, friend.
I'm admiring these drawings.

11
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,376
What about the enemy?

12
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,667
Go after them.

13
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:40,126
Interesting.

14
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:44,167
It's a pity I don't know Spanish.

15
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,667
Look, it's about my grandfather.

16
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:58,542
"Count Ollavedez, who had not yet
brought settlers to the Sierra..."

17
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,792
Captain!

18
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,667
We're being surrounded!
What shall we do?

19
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,334
Close the door!
It's drafty!

20
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,792
Where was I?

21
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,709
Here.

22
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,084
To the Sierra Morena.

23
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:24,959
This steep mountain range
between Andalusia and La Mancha,

24
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:31,084
was inhabited by robbers and gyp..."

25
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:37,167
Thank you... gypsies.

26
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:43,667
â€œThey were said to feed on
corpses of killed travellers".

27
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,626
Will we make it before night?

28
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:58,584
Before night? it'll take three days
to cross these mountains.

29
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,959
Where will we sleep?
It gets dark quickly.

30
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:06,292
Sometimes you can come
across a roadside inn.

31
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:10,459
It's usually deserted as devilish
ghosts chase the innkeepers out.

32
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,292
- Once evil spirits pick a place...
- Then what?

33
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:19,709
A traveller who comes here
should be prepared for the worst.

34
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,542
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I can cope with them.

35
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,584
Sir, listen to Mosquito.

36
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:28,542
Saddle the mules and follow me.
Hurry!

37
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,042
Sir, don't go.
Demons rave there.

38
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,292
Invisible hands push people
into the precipice.

39
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,584
Devils have goat hooves.

40
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:40,292
- Let's head for Extremadura.
- It has better sights.

41
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,959
We'll go straight ahead.

42
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:51,459
We'll make a stop at the cork oaks
to eat our provisions.

43
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:55,251
We'll stay overnight
at Venta Quemada.

44
00:08:55,501 --> 00:09:01,417
The next day we'll stock up
and head for the mountains.

45
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:05,584
After three days,
exhausted but happy,

46
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:09,417
we'll make a triumphant
ride into Castile.

47
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,584
That's my plan!
Nothing will change it!

48
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,917
It'll be the end of us.

49
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,959
Since King Philip V
honoured me

50
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:25,251
with the rank of captain
of the Wallonian Guard,

51
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:29,042
it's my duty to find
the shortest way to Madrid.

52
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:35,376
Maybe the king did honour you,

53
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:39,626
but your mind lacks reason.

54
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,584
I feel thirsty.

55
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,167
It's bad to drink water
after eating fruit.

56
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,209
Where's the mule keeper?

57
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:07,459
I don't like it.
He ran away with our provisions!

58
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,834
Don't say that. I bet evil spirits
kidnapped poor Mosquito.

59
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,667
He ran away!

60
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,167
Damned thug!

61
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,667
He had these shrewd eyes.

62
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:22,042
Why didn't I listen
to Brother Jerome De La Trinidad,

63
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,042
holy monk and preacher?

64
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,542
Mosquito!

65
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,959
He said Wallonian Guard officers
were heretics!

66
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:31,959
Shut up, fool!

67
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,709
I'll get him.

68
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,876
I'll break his bones
if he chickened out.

69
00:11:44,126 --> 00:11:46,709
I beg you.
Don't leave me alone here.

70
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,959
- Let's go!
- I can't.

71
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,542
We'll talk later.

72
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:06,667
Mosquito!

73
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,626
He ran away.

74
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,501
Two foreign ladies staying
in this inn invite you to supper.

75
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,792
Follow me, cavalier.

76
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,501
Señor cavalier.

77
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,542
Thank you for being so kind
and sharing our modest supper.

78
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:57,292
Satisfy your hunger.

79
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:00,292
You probably haven't eaten all day.

80
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,501
Are you surprised to meet us?

81
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:08,751
My name is Emina.
This is my sister Zibelda.

82
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,959
We live in Tunis.
But we come from Grenada,

83
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,917
where our relatives secretly
profess the faith of our fathers.

84
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,292
Our journey is
a well-kept secret.

85
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,792
We believe in your honesty
and want to confide it to you.

86
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:29,001
We expected you.

87
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:35,251
I want to tell you the story
of our family. Listen.

88
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:39,251
Do you carry the image
of your mistress in this locket?

89
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:44,459
It's a gift from my mother
with a piece of genuine relic.

90
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,709
Why are you frightened?

91
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:51,376
Only evil spirits
are afraid of relics.

92
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:53,792
We're Muslim.

93
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,917
Don't be surprised
at my sister's reaction.

94
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:01,501
We're sorry that our closest
relative has a different faith.

95
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:06,417
Me? Your relative?

96
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,126
Yes.

97
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,709
Your mother was a Gomelez.

98
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,167
We come from that family.

99
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,501
I never heard about it.

100
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:19,292
Aren't you mistaken,
my dear ladies?

101
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,042
No.

102
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:30,792
I promised to tell you
the story of our ancestors.

103
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,584
But I'll start with mine.

104
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,501
Sit down.

105
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,584
We've been waiting for you.

106
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,667
Had you shown fear
and gone a different way,

107
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,667
you'd lose our respect.

108
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:56,667
You flatter me, but I never
deviate from my way.

109
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:02,792
Why are you so preoccupied
with my courage?

110
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,917
- We're preoccupied with you.
- Me?

111
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:10,334
You won't be so flattered

112
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:14,292
when I tell you that you're
the first man we ever met.

113
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,917
My sister speaks the truth.

114
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,667
We never had a brother.

115
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,876
We were locked away
in a seraglio since childhood.

116
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:26,459
We had no idea men existed.

117
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,001
But nature endowed us
with the ability to love.

118
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,626
- So we gave each other love.
- How interesting.

119
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,167
We really love each other.

120
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:45,126
Our mother told us that

121
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:51,626
we would either remain maidens
or marry the same man.

122
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,292
That made us feel better.

123
00:19:55,376 --> 00:20:03,126
The head of the family gave us
permission to marry one man.

124
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:07,667
As long as he comes
from the Gomelez family.

125
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,917
- Is that man me?
- Yes.

126
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,167
We like that idea.

127
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,834
But my religion, my faith...

128
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,917
- Don't you like us?
- I do.

129
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:21,542
- Aren't we nice to you?
- You are.

130
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:26,917
It's nearly dawn.
Let's not waste time on idle talk.

131
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:33,084
We can't be your wives.

132
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:36,834
Unless you accept
the Prophet's law.

133
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,167
But you'll be able to see us
in your dreams.

134
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:45,709
If you keep it a secret
that we exist.

135
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,792
Do You agree?

136
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:52,292
The chalice, please!

137
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,667
Remember what you promised.

138
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:30,001
My dear cousin,
why aren't you a Muslim?

139
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:33,417
I'd be so happy to see you...

140
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:42,167
on Emina's bosom
and be your wife.

141
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,792
Follow me, my son.

142
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:55,667
Woe to him whose heart is hard
and refuses to confess his sins.

143
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:32,292
Don't spend the night
under an open sky.

144
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:50,126
Beware of all temptations
for the Lord has raised his hand.

145
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:03,292
I will do as you say, Father.
But...

146
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:10,126
My belly craves food.

147
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:13,126
Think how to salvage your soul.

148
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,501
I'll take care of
your bodily needs.

149
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:22,001
Strange things
happened last night.

150
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:26,251
Did you spend the night
at a deserted inn?

151
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,917
I was at Venta Quemada but...

152
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:36,792
I have my reasons for
not wanting to talk about it.

153
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,876
Devils tempt us.

154
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:45,126
Beware of Satan's pride.

155
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:48,376
You're right.
Beware of Satan.

156
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,792
Your courage amazes me.

157
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:56,209
Who are you, young man?

158
00:26:57,542 --> 00:27:01,417
Who raised you?
Do you believe in ghosts?

159
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,709
Me? No.

160
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,251
Don't be afraid.

161
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:22,626
He's possessed. I'm trying
to get the devil out of him.

162
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:25,584
Pacheco...

163
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,709
In the name of our Lord

164
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:33,501
I command you to take
the goats up the mountain.

165
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:51,626
It proves that the angel
of darkness has power

166
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:55,001
over this unfortunate land.

167
00:27:57,417 --> 00:28:01,751
I devote much time to him.
I hope I'll save him.

168
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:05,376
He's making progress.

169
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,251
- He milks the goats?
- Yes.

170
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:15,417
Satisfy my curiosity, son.

171
00:28:18,126 --> 00:28:20,542
I asked about your life.

172
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:25,876
It's an honour to me.
I'll tell you everything.

173
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:30,917
My family abounded in prominent
men rather than in wealth.

174
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:35,209
My father, a colonel
of the Wallonian Guard,

175
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:39,792
was a polite
and honourable nobleman.

176
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:04,167
I'm a van Worden!

177
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,292
You'll pay for this!

178
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,542
A horse!
I want a horse!

179
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:25,001
What are you waiting for, cowards?

180
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:37,542
This won't end well.

181
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:01,292
Señor
may I have a word with you?

182
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:04,834
- Please.
- In private.

183
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:09,834
Señor, I don't have the pleasure
of knowing you.

184
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:11,542
You will soon.

185
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,459
Señor?

186
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:33,917
After you.

187
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,334
Please.

188
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,376
Your carriage overtook mine.

189
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:19,251
It was an offense.
I want you to explain.

190
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:23,709
My coachman
didn't overtake yours.

191
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,751
Your Coachman dragged behind.

192
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:29,626
I admit you're right.

193
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:35,042
It's a pity you didn't say
that before I drew my sword.

194
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:40,417
I understand, señor.

195
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:16,792
Excuse me for taking up your time.

196
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:20,709
Don't mention it.
May I?

197
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:23,167
Of course, señor.

198
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:40,501
Excuse me,
I hope my roast isn't cold yet.

199
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:02,417
Water!

200
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:06,584
Why did he tell us to chop up
his carriage?

201
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,209
He'd be more comfortable now.

202
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:12,251
He couldn't look at it
after that incident.

203
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,792
- Water!
- I'd sell it.

204
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:19,501
Noblemen like him don't sell
things, they destroy them.

205
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:23,792
I'd give my wealth
for a drop of water.

206
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:28,376
Did you hear that?
You'd be rich if you had water.

207
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,917
He's crazy to start those duels.

208
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,959
If your master
likes to collect wounds,

209
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:38,417
be ready for anything.

210
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,084
Damn it!

211
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:48,209
I'd give my soul to the devil
for a drop of water.

212
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:57,001
I invited you señores
to my wedding.

213
00:34:57,251 --> 00:35:00,542
Those with whom
I crossed swords with,

214
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:03,876
but didn't get to kill.

215
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:30,334
You came to rejoice with me,
now I need your advice.

216
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,459
Here's a letter
from the mayor of Bouyon.

217
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:38,542
He summons me to take over the castle
of my ancestors in the Ardennes.

218
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:43,834
Should I leave the king's service
or abandon my heritage?

219
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,501
Take a vote.

220
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:51,751
I'll do as you say.

221
00:35:56,626 --> 00:36:01,001
Hurry, señores.
The meat is getting cold.

222
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,376
Farewell, my king.

223
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:06,376
Farewell, sunny Spain.

224
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:10,209
I invite you all to a feast
in my castle in the Ardennes.

225
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:12,876
Who'll pay me?

226
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:17,542
What a loss. it'll ruin me.

227
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:31,751
Follow me!

228
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,834
Follow the newlyweds!

229
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:00,459
There's no place
like our sunny Spain.

230
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,334
It was a stupid idea.

231
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:14,626
I'll never sing a serenade
again to a beautiful senorita.

232
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:17,917
Quiet.

233
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,584
True. it's not the same.

234
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,417
I don't envy the newlyweds.

235
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,542
Long live the newlyweds!

236
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:40,209
May your son
return quickly to Spain.

237
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:44,334
We shall name our son Alfonse.

238
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,292
Rejoice and enjoy the feast.

239
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:54,376
As a true Spaniard
I have to fulfill my duty to the end.

240
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:56,334
Yes!

241
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:27,709
This rain reminds me
of the siege of Lleida.

242
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:32,042
For three weeks I stood
waist-deep in water.

243
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:38,834
Those were the times!
I was known for my bravery.

244
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:51,959
I was born nine months later.

245
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,834
That was quite a story.

246
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:58,042
Your father is a man of honour.

247
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,167
Did you inherit this virtue?

248
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:05,376
Boasting does not befit
a Wallonian Guard officer.

249
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,334
Before you begin
to tell me about yourself,

250
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:11,709
I'll ask Pacheco to bring you
some fresh milk.

251
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,001
No. I'll start right away.

252
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:19,626
I was raised away from home
to learn the ways of a nobleman.

253
00:39:57,876 --> 00:40:01,584
â€œ...the lid flew open and I saw
a skeleton climbing out.

254
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:06,042
I drew my sword.
The skeleton tore off its left hand

255
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:10,459
and used it as a weapon
to attack me fiercely.

256
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:13,167
I defended myself bravely.

257
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,126
Suddenly
another skeleton jumped out.

258
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:19,459
It pulled out a rib
from the first one

259
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,167
and hit me on the head".

260
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,334
Welcome, my son.

261
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:39,001
It's been so long.

262
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,042
My darling boy.

263
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:46,501
I hope you haven't forgotten
the holy alphabet, son.

264
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:51,417
- Or my teachings.
- I've been a good student.

265
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:53,626
Show us.

266
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,626
Excellent.

267
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,834
My dear Uracca,
leave men's things to men.

268
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:06,001
Son, I want to show you
a master thrust.

269
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,959
It's very difficult.

270
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:12,959
But once you master it,
you'll be the best swordsman.

271
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,292
En garde!

272
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:21,834
My dear Uracca, I fought
one hundred and thirty duels.

273
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:24,709
I'll share my experience with you.

274
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,292
Allez!

275
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,917
I failed again.

276
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,834
You were a great swordsman.

277
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,251
Alfonse will take your place.

278
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,959
Son, go back to your homeland.

279
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:53,084
Spain is the most wonderful
country in the world.

280
00:41:55,251 --> 00:42:00,334
I'll see to it that you become
a Wallonian Guard captain.

281
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:04,209
So I came here and last night...

282
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,917
Yes.

283
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:12,459
My son,
your story was captivating.

284
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:17,209
I see you received
a good education.

285
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:23,709
But since you spent your last night
at Venta Quemada...

286
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,334
What was I saying?

287
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:35,084
I wonder if you were haunted
by two hanged men.

288
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:40,667
I don't want you to share
the same fate as Pacheco.

289
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,501
I'm not afraid, Father.

290
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:47,751
My mother told me
about possessed people.

291
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,542
But you can't find
them nowadays.

292
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:51,917
What?

293
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:57,334
What about this poor creature?
The devils plucked his eye out.

294
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,667
Pacheco!

295
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:04,084
His story may help you
salvage your soul.

296
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,959
I'll tell him to begin.

297
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:24,167
Pacheco, in the name of our Lord,

298
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:29,042
tell your story to our dear guest.

299
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:40,834
I was born in Cordoba.

300
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:44,584
- My father was wealthy.
- You can skip that.

301
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:47,042
His mother died three years ago.

302
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,542
His father decided to marry
a young widow.

303
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,376
Camilla de Tormes.

304
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:55,084
They wed in Seville.

305
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:59,709
A few days later my father
came home with his new wife.

306
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:02,251
And her sister Inezilia.

307
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:11,626
My dear wife, my lady,

308
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:15,209
I bought mules for your carriage.

309
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:20,834
And for you, fair Inezilia,
I bought a sapphire ring.

310
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:27,167
You're the best husband
and brother-in-law.

311
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:31,584
Inezilia is very happy,
aren't you, dear?

312
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:34,042
Thank you with all my heart.

313
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:39,501
Don't eat fruit, Inezilia.
It's bad for you.

314
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:43,042
I'm glad you're happy.

315
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:50,167
Camilla, why don't you
sing to us after dinner?

316
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:52,376
Yes! Please do!

317
00:44:53,584 --> 00:44:57,001
Come, sister.
Let's get the instruments.

318
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:20,126
I beg you, father.
Allow me marry fair Inezilia.

319
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:24,459
We'll go to Madrid
and have a wonderful life there.

320
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:26,792
Forget it, son.

321
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:32,834
First, it's not appropriate to be
your father's brother-in-law.

322
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:38,917
Second, the church does not
allow such marriages.

323
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:43,251
- Third...
- I love her more than anything!

324
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:45,917
Third, I won't have it!

325
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:51,376
You won't marry Inezilia.

326
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,792
Don't be upset, Pacheco.

327
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:09,459
If your father won't allow you
to marry my sister,

328
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:13,084
you can be her lover.

329
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:22,751
Inezilia is an angel of purity.
How could I?

330
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:29,251
Leave it to me, Pacheco.
My sister will hear my request.

331
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:33,917
I'll do it with a heavy heart.

332
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,251
Pacheco...

333
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:41,126
Who can resist you?

334
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,209
Keep it short.

335
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:49,876
Tell us how your father
went on a trip to Madrid,

336
00:46:50,126 --> 00:46:53,459
taking his wife
and her sister with him.

337
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:58,959
Every day without Inezilia
was unbearable.

338
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:04,876
I missed her and suffered.

339
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:32,667
Manuela!

340
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:51,626
- Venta Quemada?
- You'll wait for him there.

341
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:55,001
But there are brutal gangs
prowling in the Sierra Morena.

342
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:58,334
It's quiet now that the Zoto
brothers have been hanged,

343
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,501
two most horrible thugs.

344
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:05,876
Will Inezilia accompany
my father?

345
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:07,584
Yes, sir.

346
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:11,126
I'll be on my way.

347
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,126
Inezilia...

348
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:19,876
We'll never part again.

349
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:56,001
Is there food and drink here?

350
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:03,167
- Can I stay overnight?
- Sir, I beg you. Don't do it!

351
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:05,376
You have no clean bed linen?

352
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:09,459
- I can serve the royalty.
- So what's the problem?

353
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:14,042
- Ghosts roam here at night.
- Ghosts?

354
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:16,917
We spend the nights
at a village nearby.

355
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,709
It's scary here.

356
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:23,626
We'll sleep with the ghosts.

357
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:26,292
As you wish, sir.

358
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:30,459
But my wife and I will not spend
the night here.

359
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:35,709
I'll make sure the ghosts
don't steal anything.

360
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:38,792
Where are you going?

361
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:42,917
Sir, don't fool with ghosts.
I'm scared.

362
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:47,376
Get out of here!

363
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:53,876
It's time, Pacheco.

364
00:50:56,751 --> 00:51:01,251
Your father is asleep.
Inezilia is waiting.

365
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:08,334
Come.

366
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:32,584
Everything is going well.
Look.

367
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:38,792
You're right.

368
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,876
I'll give you a sign
when to come in.

369
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:08,084
Pacheco!

370
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,626
We're waiting for you.

371
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:26,959
Inezilia, do you really
desire a lover?

372
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:41,167
You two will be lovers,
but I'll always be with you.

373
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,751
Kiss her.

374
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:51,709
Passionately.

375
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:58,001
You love Inezilia
and I love you.

376
00:52:59,084 --> 00:53:05,084
She'll give you what you want.
But remember my condition.

377
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,542
What do you say, my son?

378
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:48,751
I think you would be scared
in that situation.

379
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,584
A nobleman knows no fear.

380
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:57,751
I'll tell Pacheco to go on.

381
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:02,209
I hope it gets more interesting.

382
00:54:04,001 --> 00:54:11,667
Pacheco, in the name of our Lord,
continue your story.

383
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:18,584
Half dead, I ran from the gallows.

384
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:21,751
I wandered around all day.

385
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:41,876
I know what you want to say.

386
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:45,584
If I came earlier,
I'd get a feast fit for a king.

387
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:47,917
Exactly.
There are ghosts here.

388
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:51,917
And you spend the nights
at a village nearby.

389
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:55,417
Pardon me, sir.
I have to leave you.

390
00:54:56,542 --> 00:55:01,209
Was there a nobleman from Cordoba
with two women here last night?

391
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:04,209
Well?
A nobleman from Cordoba.

392
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:09,292
My wife left some supper
for you over the hearth.

393
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:12,001
Over the hearth.

394
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,501
Pacheco!

395
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:54,959
Let me get closer to you.
I'm trembling from cold.

396
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:58,292
It's me, your Inezilia!

397
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:02,959
Go away, Satan!

398
00:56:03,251 --> 00:56:05,626
You're throwing us out?

399
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:09,709
Come, sister.
Let's light a fire.

400
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:35,667
What do you say, my son?

401
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:46,042
I see you finally realize
how powerful Satan is.

402
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:49,167
It's getting late.

403
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:52,542
I won't offer you a place
to sleep here.

404
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:55,542
Pacheco's screams
would keep you awake.

405
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:57,501
Go to the chapel.

406
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:02,001
- The chapel?
- Yes.

407
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:16,626
But I'll hear him there.

408
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:23,042
- His screams are so shrill.
- I know what I'm saying.

409
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,542
The chapel.

410
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:31,209
You'll sleep peacefully.

411
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:50,334
Kneel at the altar,
confess your sins and repent.

412
00:58:50,584 --> 00:58:52,667
It's not too late to ward off evil.

413
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:57,001
I don't think I've sinned.
In my dreams, perhaps.

414
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:11,626
Who's here?

415
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:15,501
We're cold!
It's us, your mistresses!

416
00:59:16,709 --> 00:59:20,376
Go back to your gallows.
I want to sleep.

417
00:59:20,626 --> 00:59:23,167
You scoff us
because you're in a chapel.

418
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:28,251
- Join us in the graveyard!
- I'll oblige you.

419
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,042
Tomorrow.

420
01:00:00,584 --> 01:00:03,126
You're edgy, my son.

421
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:10,042
I'm not surprised.

422
01:00:11,376 --> 01:00:16,126
Last night evil spirits
were up to no good.

423
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:18,042
The goats were bleating.

424
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:23,959
Devils like to take
all kinds of forms.

425
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:28,501
They keep away from me.

426
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,834
I see you still have faith.

427
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:37,834
- But will you persist in it?
- I will.

428
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:46,959
I won't keep you here.
You have a long way to go.

429
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:51,501
In two days you'll cross
the Sierra Morena.

430
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:55,001
I put some provisions
by your saddle.

431
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,126
What's the shortest way to Madrid?

432
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:02,834
I've never been to Madrid.

433
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:08,251
But I know it's... that way.

434
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,126
Thank you, Father.

435
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:26,792
Remember!
God has raised his hand!

436
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:05,876
- Señor Alfonse van Worden?
- Captain of the Wallonian Guard.

437
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:09,417
I arrest you in the name
of the Holy Inquisition.

438
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,334
Your sword!

439
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:25,751
I'm a nobleman!

440
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:28,709
What a noisy sinner.

441
01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:33,126
I hope he's just as talkative
before the Holy Tribunal.

442
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:34,417
Amen.

443
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,584
I'm going to Madrid!

444
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:17,584
We let the wrongdoer
accuse himself.

445
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:22,834
This kind of confession,
though it may seem forced,

446
01:03:23,084 --> 01:03:25,084
has its advantages.

447
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:30,001
Especially when the wrongdoer
names his collaborators.

448
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:45,584
Do you know
two African princesses?

449
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:51,959
It won't do you any good
to keep silent.

450
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:58,084
I guess I'll have to help you.

451
01:03:59,459 --> 01:04:03,084
Let's see how much you can take.

452
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:14,834
Are you going to faint?

453
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:21,126
Smelling salts will make you
conscious again.

454
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:25,376
Let's carry on.

455
01:04:25,626 --> 01:04:28,709
- Alfonse!
- What is this?

456
01:04:29,751 --> 01:04:32,209
You're saved!

457
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:35,084
Señor Zoto has come
to your rescue!

458
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,917
Dear Alfonse!

459
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,584
Alfonse!

460
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:45,751
You've been so brave.

461
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:48,376
There's no time for kisses.

462
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:52,126
We have to leave by the time
the guards get here.

463
01:04:52,376 --> 01:04:54,792
This is Señor Zoto.

464
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:59,626
Señor Alfonse, allow me
to introduce my brothers.

465
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:01,542
Chico.

466
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:06,292
Moma and Chico.

467
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:11,001
How come, Zoto?
Your brothers were hanged.

468
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:13,792
You heard right.

469
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:17,417
But you can see
for yourself they're fine.

470
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:20,209
I saw them myself!

471
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:26,459
You saw two shepherds
hanging to pacify local people.

472
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:34,501
What? Don't mention it.
We have great horses.

473
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:37,167
I'm glad you feel better.

474
01:05:40,959 --> 01:05:43,584
May happiness be with you.

475
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:45,834
They're surrounding us!

476
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:50,876
Chico! Cover us!
Let's mount our horses!

477
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,251
Where's my sword?

478
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:06,251
Careful!

479
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:09,459
Hit harder!

480
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,959
Kiss me.

481
01:07:34,459 --> 01:07:36,167
It's my turn now.

482
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,501
I'm so happy!

483
01:07:40,126 --> 01:07:43,042
Are you pleased we're here,
cousin?

484
01:07:45,709 --> 01:07:47,334
Cousin...

485
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:50,459
This locket is horrible.

486
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:57,042
It prevents us from loving you
more passionately.

487
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:49,876
Are you happy, cousin?

488
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:52,501
Yes.

489
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:56,792
But I must admit that

490
01:08:57,042 --> 01:09:01,667
I'm not pleased with the way
our night together ended.

491
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:04,459
We had our pleasures.

492
01:09:05,084 --> 01:09:07,417
But it wasn't so pleasant
in the morning.

493
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:09,959
Let's forget it.

494
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,751
It's plaited from our hair.

495
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:18,334
This talisman will make you
remember us.

496
01:09:19,834 --> 01:09:21,626
A talisman?

497
01:09:21,876 --> 01:09:26,542
They say you can love only
one woman. Wrong.

498
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:29,709
I love you two the same way.

499
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:33,001
You're both in my heart.

500
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:37,792
- Accept our faith.
- You'll ascend the throne in Tunis.

501
01:09:38,042 --> 01:09:41,834
Seraglios, gardens, fountains.

502
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:46,667
Let's not talk about kingdoms
flooded by sunshine.

503
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:49,876
We're in an abyss
on the edge of hell.

504
01:09:54,376 --> 01:10:02,042
How dare you be in the company
of Gomelez women?

505
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:06,334
You're doomed, cousin.

506
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:08,376
Forgive us!

507
01:10:08,626 --> 01:10:12,167
You'll be killed like
a coward with this axe,

508
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:16,209
and your corpse will be hung
next to the Zoto brothers

509
01:10:16,459 --> 01:10:20,084
at the mercy of vultures
and evil spirits, or...

510
01:10:20,459 --> 01:10:21,709
But the Zoto brothers...

511
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:27,251
Or you'll drink
the potion from this chalice.

512
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,667
In one gulp!

513
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:46,251
Father, wouldn't you do the same
in the name of honour?

514
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:44,542
What a horrible misunderstanding.

515
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:49,667
Evil spirits take so many forms,
it's really confusing.

516
01:11:49,917 --> 01:11:53,084
Señor, you're here?
You're too young for a kabbalist.

517
01:11:53,334 --> 01:11:56,376
But you have a rope
around your neck.

518
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:00,626
Don't worry.
I know you're brave.

519
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:03,167
However, you lack experience.

520
01:12:05,876 --> 01:12:07,584
Your name is Alfonse.

521
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:10,709
Your mother is a Gomelez.

522
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,917
You're captain of
the Wallonian Guard.

523
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:19,459
Let's go from this awful place.
We'll decide what to do next.

524
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:22,334
My name is Alfonse van Worden.

525
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:24,959
I know that.

526
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,001
I see you're weak.

527
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:31,751
I have this wonderful potion.
It will make you strong.

528
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:33,209
No.

529
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:36,292
No more potions.

530
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:44,042
- Where are you heading, sir?
- Madrid.

531
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:49,167
Good. We'll stop at a place
where I left a hearty meal.

532
01:12:50,334 --> 01:12:52,667
I said hearty, not wonderful.

533
01:12:54,459 --> 01:12:56,167
Now listen.

534
01:12:56,417 --> 01:13:00,376
Ancient books contain
Chaldean wisdom.

535
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:05,251
While the verses of Shir Hashirim
are pure beautiful poetry.

536
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:09,584
In Hebrew every letter is a number,
every word a wise combination.

537
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:11,917
Every sentence is a formula.

538
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:15,667
If you pronounce it with proper
exhalation and accent,

539
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,792
you can move mountains
and drain rivers.

540
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:22,709
Adonai created the world...

541
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:30,459
This is where somebody
played a joke on me last night.

542
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:32,126
Let's go in.

543
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:39,584
- My horse! it's unbelievable.
- And mine is here.

544
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:44,292
I don't understand.

545
01:13:44,542 --> 01:13:46,709
A horse follows his master.

546
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:55,376
It's lucky that devils
don't need food.

547
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:35,876
Good, isn't it?

548
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:38,417
Good what?

549
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:42,792
I'm just asking.
I'm glad I can satisfy your hunger.

550
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,292
What is this?

551
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:51,542
Is it yours?

552
01:14:55,126 --> 01:14:58,542
So you spent the night
in this inn as well.

553
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:02,042
I did. But I'm not going
to talk about it.

554
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,709
It was a wonderful night.

555
01:15:07,542 --> 01:15:11,209
- In spite of everything.
- In spite of what?

556
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:14,126
- I won't say. I gave my word.
- To whom?

557
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,834
Two beautiful women.
Don't ask.

558
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,001
Let's go.

559
01:15:24,834 --> 01:15:26,959
It's a long way to Madrid.

560
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:32,417
Do you know the shortest way?

561
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,709
Yes. it's that way.

562
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:38,334
That's where
the Inquisition captured me.

563
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:42,501
You're right.
Let's avoid their ambush.

564
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:52,667
Are there other paths?

565
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,126
Kabbalists always find the way.

566
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:59,042
We'll go around
and get on the trail to Madrid.

567
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:28,084
The books of Sefer Zohar explain
the depth of the ten elements

568
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,334
forming the unity of taste.

569
01:16:30,584 --> 01:16:34,334
Thus we can define the powers
ruling the pandemonistic world.

570
01:16:34,584 --> 01:16:37,376
Do you have to keep using
incomprehensible words?

571
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,501
It makes the journey
more interesting.

572
01:16:39,751 --> 01:16:42,251
There are all kinds of demons,

573
01:16:42,501 --> 01:16:48,334
among which we can find
Hungarian and Polish zombies...

574
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:22,917
Help!

575
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:30,542
I arrest you in the name
of the Holy Inquisition.

576
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:32,292
Your sword!

577
01:17:33,626 --> 01:17:36,542
Alfonse van Worden, don't resist!

578
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:40,501
I am Don Pedro Velasquez.
Are you crazy?

579
01:17:40,751 --> 01:17:42,251
Indeed.

580
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,251
It's not him. Who is it?

581
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:59,001
Don Pedro. He looked similar.
What are you doing here?

582
01:17:59,251 --> 01:18:01,459
Anybody can use the roads.

583
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:04,042
Bandits!

584
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:07,876
There is no road here.
Go on your way!

585
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:10,876
That man must have taken
another path.

586
01:18:13,376 --> 01:18:15,876
What if he went back
to Venta Quemada?

587
01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:18,792
I heard he was coming here.

588
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:21,917
You're not eager
to apologize, are you?

589
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,626
Get out of here!

590
01:18:23,876 --> 01:18:27,917
In that case I apologize to you,
honourable señores.

591
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:37,084
A thorn.

592
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:39,917
I can't take it out.

593
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:00,667
Bad luck.

594
01:19:08,209 --> 01:19:10,334
There's no place to hide.

595
01:19:11,126 --> 01:19:13,376
Just in case, of course.

596
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:29,417
- Señor Alfonse van Worden?
- Yes.

597
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:34,001
Don't go that way. Some impolite
thugs are waiting for you.

598
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:35,834
- The Inquisition?
- Yes.

599
01:19:36,084 --> 01:19:38,751
I'm really surprised.
The Inquisition here?

600
01:19:39,001 --> 01:19:41,584
They didn't realize you weren't
Alfonse van Worden?

601
01:19:41,834 --> 01:19:46,501
Obviously. They attacked me.
It's logical, isn't it?

602
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:48,042
Unbelievable.

603
01:19:50,626 --> 01:19:51,876
What now?

604
01:19:52,126 --> 01:19:55,959
You'll go to my castle.
It's just a few miles away.

605
01:19:56,209 --> 01:20:00,084
You have a castle nearby?
You didn't mention it.

606
01:20:00,334 --> 01:20:03,334
He must be a modest man.

607
01:20:03,584 --> 01:20:04,917
What if they find me?

608
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,667
They can't enter it.
We'll take the shortest way.

609
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:12,917
Can I avail of your hospitality?
I'll have a safe night.

610
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:17,292
I know señor kabbalist.
He never refuses shelter.

611
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,584
- Of course.
- Thank you.

612
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:23,751
I'll have time to think about
what happened to me.

613
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:27,126
Thinking about it can drive
an inexperienced person insane.

614
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:32,376
The human mind can take
in anything, if used properly.

615
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:52,667
END OF PART ONE

616
01:20:56,667 --> 01:21:04,501
THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT
PART TWO

617
01:21:45,084 --> 01:21:47,584
Enrico, the master is back.

618
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:50,417
- What happened?
- I don't know.

619
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:56,792
You deserve a rest
after a long journey.

620
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:59,251
You'll be safe here.

621
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:02,334
My house is at your disposal.

622
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,792
- The 15th century.
- I see you're an expert.

623
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:08,917
Curiosity distinguishes
humans from animals.

624
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:11,584
I observe, listen
and make conclusions.

625
01:22:11,834 --> 01:22:18,584
I'm glad I met you.
I enjoy your company.

626
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:24,001
Good company works wonders.
It beats wealth or black magic.

627
01:22:24,334 --> 01:22:26,834
This is no place to talk.

628
01:22:27,084 --> 01:22:30,251
Please come inside.
Enrico, show the way.

629
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:49,584
I expected you in three days.

630
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:52,126
Unforeseen circumstances
and complications arose.

631
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:53,709
It all got out of hand.

632
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:56,709
- What now?
- I don't know.

633
01:22:57,251 --> 01:23:00,626
We must keep him here at all cost.
I'll wait for instructions.

634
01:23:00,876 --> 01:23:02,376
Who's the other man?

635
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:09,834
Be careful. Don't ask questions.
Go make yourself beautiful.

636
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:11,709
You could have warned me.

637
01:23:11,959 --> 01:23:14,584
Don't nag, my dear.
I couldn't.

638
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:21,959
I get the impression
it's the work of evil spirits.

639
01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:25,126
I'd rather blame people.

640
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:30,709
Maybe somebody wants
you to go through all this.

641
01:23:30,959 --> 01:23:38,042
I'm much obliged. I feel you'll
help me solve this riddle.

642
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:41,876
I like this place.
It's peaceful and quiet.

643
01:23:42,126 --> 01:23:44,709
Think about it, señor.

644
01:23:54,376 --> 01:23:57,042
Do you have everything you need?

645
01:23:59,626 --> 01:24:03,959
- I don't know how to thank you.
- It's nothing. Please feel at home.

646
01:24:04,209 --> 01:24:06,292
Thank you. I feel fine here.

647
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,334
I really do.

648
01:24:09,626 --> 01:24:12,709
- I did some thinking.
- And?

649
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:18,876
It'll be best for me to get to Madrid
as soon as possible.

650
01:24:19,501 --> 01:24:24,167
Maybe I can make it at night.

651
01:24:25,584 --> 01:24:28,584
The Inquisition
is guarding all roads.

652
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:36,834
Maybe Señor Velasquez
will give me some advice.

653
01:24:37,084 --> 01:24:38,626
He's a skeptic.

654
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:42,209
- What shall I do?
- Wait.

655
01:24:57,584 --> 01:24:59,667
Have a look at my books.

656
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:04,542
You'll find all the wisdom
of the world on these shelves.

657
01:25:09,292 --> 01:25:12,126
I recommend Spanish writings.

658
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:57,084
Don Pedro, I found the answer.

659
01:26:57,584 --> 01:26:59,459
Have some wine, it's late.

660
01:26:59,709 --> 01:27:03,376
Maybe it's the last time
we'll light our vigil lamps.

661
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:06,709
Come, I want to
show you something.

662
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:11,251
If you feel sad,
drink some good wine.

663
01:27:11,876 --> 01:27:17,001
Soon we'll all rest
in eternal night.

664
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:20,959
How can you be so reckless?
If he had read this to the end,

665
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:25,751
the events which would follow
would be totally meaningless.

666
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:30,042
Luckily I came in time.

667
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:53,251
Strange things are
happening here, senor.

668
01:27:55,126 --> 01:27:57,417
I saw it with my own eyes!

669
01:27:58,251 --> 01:28:01,376
I held it in my hands.

670
01:28:03,042 --> 01:28:06,084
It's the work of evil spirits.

671
01:28:08,834 --> 01:28:13,542
I understand that your mind
is rebelling against phenomena,

672
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:17,042
which have no explanation
in the structure of matter.

673
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:21,334
But... try to explain.

674
01:28:28,084 --> 01:28:30,417
What are you looking for?

675
01:28:31,626 --> 01:28:34,001
There was a book here.

676
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:36,292
I saw the gallows.

677
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:38,167
Where is it?

678
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:41,959
Here? I've never seen
a book like that.

679
01:28:49,209 --> 01:28:53,792
- Is it the demons again?
- They can be irritating.

680
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:57,959
Unfortunately the world
is full of them.

681
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:01,834
Kabbalist incantations can stop
them from doing bad things.

682
01:29:02,084 --> 01:29:03,459
It's absolute nonsense.

683
01:29:03,709 --> 01:29:07,876
- You don't believe in Kabbalah?
- No.

684
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:10,001
What if I have proof?

685
01:29:10,584 --> 01:29:16,417
- I'd have to prove it myself.
- Go on.

686
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:20,709
This is no place
for philosophical disputes.

687
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:35,459
I'm so glad to see you, brother.
When did you get back?

688
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:39,084
This is Alfonse van Worden,
captain of the guard.

689
01:29:39,334 --> 01:29:41,667
Captain, my sister Rebecca.

690
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:46,709
Don Pedro Velasquez.

691
01:29:46,959 --> 01:29:49,751
- Madam.
- Welcome.

692
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:54,292
I'm glad I convinced you about
the power of the supernatural.

693
01:29:54,542 --> 01:29:55,917
Of course.

694
01:30:01,834 --> 01:30:07,209
Señor Alfonse, please tell me
what you think about

695
01:30:07,459 --> 01:30:11,417
everything that happened
to you since you came here.

696
01:30:14,376 --> 01:30:16,501
I don't know what to say.

697
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:21,709
I was put to sleep with a potion
and taken to the gallows.

698
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:26,626
You were at the gallows
of the Zoto brothers?

699
01:30:27,709 --> 01:30:29,792
You saw them hanging?

700
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:35,334
Do they have a habit
of freeing themselves?

701
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:38,251
Yes. Usually at night.

702
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:48,542
Your palm reads that you are
possessed by love for demons.

703
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:53,001
You have no fear of people.

704
01:30:53,251 --> 01:30:55,376
I'm not afraid of anybody.

705
01:30:58,001 --> 01:31:00,084
I'm afraid for you.

706
01:31:21,959 --> 01:31:24,251
I'm so happy they're here.

707
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:29,959
We'll rejoice and have fun.

708
01:31:31,709 --> 01:31:35,542
I'm sorry, I have different plans.

709
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:43,584
Whatever it is, you can spend
some time in our company.

710
01:31:57,834 --> 01:32:01,292
Why is your brother greeting
a gypsy so warmly?

711
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:02,792
A gypsy?

712
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:06,709
You'll soon see
what kind of gypsy he is.

713
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:15,167
Welcome, Señor Alfonse.

714
01:32:15,417 --> 01:32:17,501
How do you know who I am?

715
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:20,834
Our camp moves
from one place to another.

716
01:32:21,084 --> 01:32:26,126
My daughters are fortune-tellers.
Their eyes and ears are open.

717
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:37,251
An enchanted place.

718
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:40,459
The people of Sierra Morena
are afraid to come near it.

719
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:43,542
It's not in my interest
to tell them they're wrong.

720
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:48,001
This way most of my retinue
stays outside the castle.

721
01:32:48,376 --> 01:32:49,792
Señor Avadoro,

722
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:55,334
I bet you have encountered many
adventures in your wandering life.

723
01:32:57,917 --> 01:32:59,251
That's true.

724
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:02,834
Tells us a story
and Señor Velasquez will teach us

725
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:06,209
how to experience poetry
without the help of ghosts.

726
01:33:06,459 --> 01:33:08,167
I don't succumb to ghosts.

727
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:11,584
But I'm beginning to fear
the magical power...

728
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:13,126
of you, madam.

729
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:21,626
I believe that the story of love
is the same all over the world.

730
01:33:28,084 --> 01:33:32,751
I think you'll enjoy hearing
about my youthful adventures.

731
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:36,501
Some are amazing.

732
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:39,126
I could even say miraculous.

733
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:47,334
Every time I go back to those
distant times of my life,

734
01:33:49,876 --> 01:33:55,084
I hear the turmoil
of passion and storms.

735
01:34:30,084 --> 01:34:34,084
You look smarter than others.
I have a delicate matter.

736
01:34:34,334 --> 01:34:35,584
Follow me.

737
01:34:50,334 --> 01:34:52,792
I'm a young woman's lover.

738
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:57,834
I think it's hard for her
to remain faithful.

739
01:34:58,084 --> 01:35:02,626
If you see a woman whose dress
suits this piece of fabric,

740
01:35:02,876 --> 01:35:06,417
watch if she goes to church
or elsewhere.

741
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:08,959
Here.

742
01:35:10,376 --> 01:35:14,709
- You'll get another one later.
- You're her husband, right?

743
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:18,417
I'm paying you to discover
infidelity, not who I am.

744
01:35:18,667 --> 01:35:21,334
Keep your eyes wide open.
They're calling for vespers.

745
01:35:21,584 --> 01:35:24,542
- I'll be waiting at the inn.
- The Inn of Lovers?

746
01:35:24,792 --> 01:35:26,084
Yes.

747
01:36:06,959 --> 01:36:10,126
- What are you doing?
- Your beauty blinded me.

748
01:36:10,376 --> 01:36:12,917
You're being suspected of infidelity.

749
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:14,501
Follow me.

750
01:36:16,459 --> 01:36:18,876
Give this to cavalier Toledo.

751
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:34,709
My noble cavalier?

752
01:36:35,626 --> 01:36:40,042
It's against my conscience
to take money from both parties.

753
01:37:37,626 --> 01:37:39,584
What's my destiny?

754
01:37:40,959 --> 01:37:44,376
We'll get married under
a big chestnut tree.

755
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:48,709
Nature will hear our vows,
soft twilight will bless us.

756
01:37:51,709 --> 01:37:56,959
I lost cavalier Toledo's address.
He invited me to a feast.

757
01:37:57,209 --> 01:37:59,251
Across the square.

758
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:03,001
- Until we meet again.
- Who knows?

759
01:39:38,084 --> 01:39:39,501
Señor Toledo?

760
01:39:40,334 --> 01:39:43,792
A lady asked me
to give this to you.

761
01:39:44,959 --> 01:39:47,751
I appreciate your wit, my friend...

762
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:50,667
and honour.

763
01:40:01,042 --> 01:40:04,001
Do you want to be
one of my servants?

764
01:40:04,251 --> 01:40:06,876
I can't.
I was born a nobleman.

765
01:40:07,542 --> 01:40:12,584
I took on the role of a beggar
as it doesn't dim my nobility.

766
01:40:13,292 --> 01:40:16,209
An answer worthy of a Spaniard.

767
01:40:16,459 --> 01:40:17,584
Cheers.

768
01:40:22,834 --> 01:40:25,542
Human life is so fragile.

769
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:30,001
Why the gloomy thoughts?

770
01:40:33,501 --> 01:40:35,001
I'm a sinner.

771
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:53,709
I used to leave
one mistress for another.

772
01:40:53,959 --> 01:40:57,959
But I thought
I was wasting too much time.

773
01:40:58,209 --> 01:41:02,376
So I'd start a new affair before
breaking off the last one,

774
01:41:02,626 --> 01:41:04,501
and plan a next one.

775
01:41:05,084 --> 01:41:09,542
Spanish women
have an urgency about them.

776
01:41:09,959 --> 01:41:11,709
I swore love to each of them.

777
01:41:11,959 --> 01:41:15,126
Punishment for breaking
an oath is severe.

778
01:41:16,209 --> 01:41:18,334
In the other world.

779
01:41:23,959 --> 01:41:28,334
My friend Aquillar from Malta
paid me a visit yesterday.

780
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:35,876
A nobleman, a good Christian.

781
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:46,459
How is it possible that we could
be friends being so different?

782
01:41:48,084 --> 01:41:49,917
You're not drinking?

783
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:54,626
I finished a bottle
and you hardly touched your glass.

784
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:12,584
What are you thinking about?

785
01:42:12,834 --> 01:42:15,126
The sun I saw today.

786
01:42:16,334 --> 01:42:19,084
I was wondering whether
I'll see it tomorrow.

787
01:42:19,334 --> 01:42:22,084
Sure. If it's not misty.

788
01:42:22,334 --> 01:42:24,834
I may not live to see tomorrow.

789
01:42:27,876 --> 01:42:30,459
Are you planning a duel?

790
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:38,167
- I can be your witness.
- I couldn't ask you to do that.

791
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:41,626
Good heavens!

792
01:42:44,209 --> 01:42:47,292
You took up an old feud
with my brother?

793
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:50,917
You mean I'll lose my friend
or my brother in one duel?

794
01:42:51,167 --> 01:42:54,209
I have a bad feeling.
Wait until midnight.

795
01:42:54,459 --> 01:43:00,417
If I die, I'll come and warn you
what punishment awaits sinners.

796
01:43:03,959 --> 01:43:08,584
I didn't want to see you,
but I heard a voice from heaven.

797
01:43:12,209 --> 01:43:13,834
No.

798
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:02,459
Are you gone?

799
01:44:03,042 --> 01:44:04,792
Yes!

800
01:44:06,876 --> 01:44:11,292
Is there purgatory
in the other world?

801
01:44:11,542 --> 01:44:13,167
Yes!

802
01:44:13,417 --> 01:44:16,501
That's where I am!

803
01:44:35,084 --> 01:44:36,709
Who died?

804
01:44:38,251 --> 01:44:40,417
Tell me who died!

805
01:44:52,292 --> 01:44:54,417
Toledo fell unconscious.

806
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:03,167
Excuse me, duty calls.

807
01:45:03,542 --> 01:45:05,834
What a moment to stop.

808
01:45:06,084 --> 01:45:10,209
Only real masters know
how to mount suspense.

809
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:12,959
I'm confused.

810
01:45:14,084 --> 01:45:19,167
I don't know where reality ends
and fantasy begins.

811
01:45:20,292 --> 01:45:23,042
You mean poetry?

812
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:26,584
I don't know what you mean.

813
01:45:27,417 --> 01:45:32,292
I'll tell you something that is
based on geometry principles.

814
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:35,251
If I want to define
infinite greatness,

815
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:38,626
I write a horizontal eight
and divide it by one.

816
01:45:39,459 --> 01:45:42,167
If I want to mark
infinite smallness,

817
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:46,376
I write one
and divide it by that eight.

818
01:45:46,834 --> 01:45:53,667
But these signs tell me nothing
about what I want to express.

819
01:45:53,917 --> 01:45:57,209
Infinite greatness is cosmos.

820
01:45:57,459 --> 01:46:03,209
Infinite smallness is infinite root
of the smallest part of an atom.

821
01:46:03,459 --> 01:46:10,542
So I mark infinity,
but I don't comprehend it.

822
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:16,376
If I don't comprehend it,
but I can mark it,

823
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:19,876
I'm getting close to poetry.

824
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:25,501
It seems to be closer to life
than we assume.

825
01:46:26,334 --> 01:46:30,209
And faith? Empirical science
contributes to disbelief.

826
01:46:30,459 --> 01:46:35,834
Only an ignorant man thinks
he understands what he sees.

827
01:46:36,084 --> 01:46:41,084
A true scholar has to solve
many riddles.

828
01:46:42,209 --> 01:46:47,042
He goes astray, but he gets
nearer to his goal every day.

829
01:46:49,667 --> 01:46:53,626
Señor Avadoro was telling us
the story of cavalier Toledo.

830
01:46:53,876 --> 01:46:57,834
I remember he was disturbed
by a voice from the other world.

831
01:46:58,084 --> 01:46:59,376
Yes.

832
01:46:59,792 --> 01:47:03,334
His sensitive soul
was stirred by emotions.

833
01:47:04,959 --> 01:47:07,834
He fell into despair.

834
01:47:28,376 --> 01:47:32,542
- What are you doing?
- I want to rethink my life.

835
01:47:39,459 --> 01:47:43,126
Señor cavalier,
allow me to say something.

836
01:47:44,292 --> 01:47:49,334
The voice you heard yesterday
only said what is in catechism.

837
01:47:49,959 --> 01:47:52,959
There is no need to worry.

838
01:47:53,542 --> 01:47:58,667
My friend, one who hears
the voice of the dead,

839
01:48:00,292 --> 01:48:04,084
will not remain among
the living for very long.

840
01:49:02,667 --> 01:49:05,834
Farewell, my friend.

841
01:49:25,084 --> 01:49:28,792
Tell that lady everything
without going into details.

842
01:49:55,209 --> 01:49:57,417
You'll help me.
I have a delicate matter.

843
01:49:58,334 --> 01:50:02,584
I would be glad to help,
but I can't leave my client.

844
01:50:02,834 --> 01:50:05,042
I'll take care of him.
It won't take long.

845
01:50:05,292 --> 01:50:06,417
Listen.

846
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:18,667
I warn you,
he's a windbag and a bore.

847
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:22,626
There is something
interesting in every story.

848
01:50:24,959 --> 01:50:29,417
You remember that senor
I had wine with at your inn?

849
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:32,292
He's the husband
of a young noblewoman.

850
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:35,542
Give her this little jewel.
Be discreet.

851
01:50:54,584 --> 01:50:56,417
Señor Lopez Soarez?

852
01:51:01,334 --> 01:51:04,251
Love has its magic
just like fortune-telling.

853
01:51:04,501 --> 01:51:07,084
Something tells me
you'll see me again.

854
01:51:07,334 --> 01:51:08,542
Who knows?

855
01:51:43,292 --> 01:51:47,126
You're kind, my good man.
But the medicine is awful.

856
01:51:47,459 --> 01:51:51,959
I'd give you something tasty,
but the medic insisted.

857
01:51:52,376 --> 01:51:55,417
Sit down. Come on.

858
01:51:59,376 --> 01:52:02,042
I have a certain weakness.

859
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:06,459
Do me a favour
and take that instrument.

860
01:52:12,876 --> 01:52:14,584
Now listen.

861
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:20,001
I am the only son
of Gaspar Soarez,

862
01:52:20,417 --> 01:52:22,251
the richest merchant in Cadiz.

863
01:52:27,084 --> 01:52:29,751
Wasting your time on
love stories again?

864
01:52:30,959 --> 01:52:32,584
Yes, daddy?

865
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:40,209
It's time you went to Madrid.

866
01:52:41,042 --> 01:52:43,542
To get out into the world.

867
01:52:43,792 --> 01:52:46,542
Daddy, I want to get married.

868
01:52:47,834 --> 01:52:50,709
First you have to pass
an exam in life.

869
01:52:51,542 --> 01:52:54,376
You must obey these rules.

870
01:52:55,126 --> 01:52:59,001
Don't get into any conversation
with noblemen.

871
01:52:59,167 --> 01:53:05,292
They grace us with their presence
just to get a loan they can't repay.

872
01:53:05,542 --> 01:53:06,876
You understand?

873
01:53:07,959 --> 01:53:10,584
I forbid you to use
the title of â€œDon".

874
01:53:10,834 --> 01:53:13,292
Your are Soarez, that's it.

875
01:53:13,667 --> 01:53:17,459
You are not allowed
to use the sword.

876
01:53:18,209 --> 01:53:22,292
It brings more shame than pride.

877
01:53:23,251 --> 01:53:27,459
Last but not least.

878
01:53:28,876 --> 01:53:34,417
You are not allowed to get into
any kind of relationship

879
01:53:34,667 --> 01:53:37,167
with the family of banker Moro.

880
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:38,667
Moro?

881
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:43,209
Now I'll tell you why.

882
01:53:44,709 --> 01:53:49,001
I am related with
the biggest bankers in Spain.

883
01:53:49,251 --> 01:53:53,876
But I see you're doing good
business with the Philippines.

884
01:53:54,126 --> 01:53:58,251
I will deposit one million
with you as a limited partner.

885
01:53:58,501 --> 01:54:00,251
I am honoured.

886
01:54:12,292 --> 01:54:17,251
I'll try to double your deposit
as soon as possible.

887
01:54:17,501 --> 01:54:19,751
There's no hurry.

888
01:54:20,876 --> 01:54:22,376
It's a pity I didn't hurry.

889
01:54:40,584 --> 01:54:44,417
My name is Moro,
the royal banker.

890
01:54:45,084 --> 01:54:49,542
My relative, Señor Levardez,
has passed away.

891
01:54:49,792 --> 01:54:54,667
I found a cheque you wrote
for one million.

892
01:54:55,584 --> 01:55:00,751
I want you to return that money.
I am his legal beneficiary.

893
01:55:01,001 --> 01:55:03,001
I invested that million.

894
01:55:03,251 --> 01:55:07,209
I will double it
in the future or even...

895
01:55:07,459 --> 01:55:09,292
I'm very sorry.

896
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:20,292
All right.

897
01:55:22,334 --> 01:55:25,459
Here is your late
relative's deposit.

898
01:55:31,167 --> 01:55:33,042
Now listen carefully.

899
01:55:33,917 --> 01:55:37,792
Two years later my ships returned.
I tripled that money.

900
01:55:38,042 --> 01:55:43,792
I wrote a letter to banker Moro
saying I had two million of his.

901
01:55:55,667 --> 01:55:58,001
My superior received your letter.

902
01:55:58,251 --> 01:56:03,876
He informs you that the Levardez
capital was entered into the books.

903
01:56:04,126 --> 01:56:06,626
He has no further claims.

904
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:09,084
I owe him two million!

905
01:56:09,334 --> 01:56:11,876
My superior won't hear it.

906
01:56:12,459 --> 01:56:13,834
It's an insult!

907
01:56:15,126 --> 01:56:17,792
I don't need his generous gift!

908
01:56:18,042 --> 01:56:20,584
Moro is insulting me!

909
01:56:21,084 --> 01:56:23,334
I began to claim my rights.

910
01:56:24,042 --> 01:56:27,209
For the sake of my good name
and reputation.

911
01:56:27,917 --> 01:56:29,626
I went to court.

912
01:56:30,126 --> 01:56:34,084
The tribunal of Seville
ruled in favour of Moro.

913
01:56:34,334 --> 01:56:38,876
We have to pay six hundred
thousand piastres in court fees.

914
01:56:39,126 --> 01:56:40,959
We didn't find justice.

915
01:56:41,209 --> 01:56:43,251
We wasted six years.

916
01:56:43,501 --> 01:56:47,709
Those two million are mine?
It's deplorable!

917
01:56:48,626 --> 01:56:51,334
You will appeal!

918
01:56:53,876 --> 01:56:57,584
Now you see I have good
reasons to forbid you

919
01:56:57,834 --> 01:57:02,792
any contact with the family
of banker Moro.

920
01:57:03,417 --> 01:57:04,709
What happened next?

921
01:57:04,959 --> 01:57:07,251
I said goodbye to my father.

922
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:12,459
I took my love stories bought
in Cadiz and left for Madrid.

923
01:57:12,709 --> 01:57:17,542
Can I have more of that mixture,
my good man?

924
01:57:22,751 --> 01:57:25,126
It makes me feel stronger.

925
01:57:29,084 --> 01:57:34,584
Those sentimental stories
made my heart melt.

926
01:57:35,917 --> 01:57:40,417
When I came here I felt
I was ready for love,

927
01:57:40,667 --> 01:57:45,001
even though I did not meet
the object of my affection yet.

928
01:57:56,334 --> 01:57:58,501
Cavalier, over here!

929
01:58:02,959 --> 01:58:04,334
Excuse me.

930
01:58:19,251 --> 01:58:20,751
Who is that?

931
01:58:23,792 --> 01:58:26,626
Put the chest over there.
Come in.

932
01:58:30,501 --> 01:58:33,126
Allow me, señor.

933
01:58:43,251 --> 01:58:45,417
Go away!

934
01:59:13,417 --> 01:59:16,126
Señor Don Lopez Soarez.

935
01:59:16,376 --> 01:59:18,542
I came to pay my respects.

936
01:59:18,792 --> 01:59:23,501
I am generally known
under the name of...

937
01:59:27,167 --> 01:59:33,834
under the name of...
Don Roque Busqueros,

938
01:59:34,126 --> 01:59:36,001
a family from Old Castile.

939
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:39,459
My father forbade me to use
the title of â€œDon".

940
01:59:39,709 --> 01:59:42,001
And I'm not allowed
to associate with noblemen.

941
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:43,876
Señor Don Lopez!

942
01:59:44,126 --> 01:59:47,834
My father told me to address
noble merchants as â€œDons"

943
01:59:48,084 --> 01:59:51,792
and to seek their company.

944
01:59:56,292 --> 01:59:58,876
I respect my father's will.

945
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:08,084
I was impressed by
your posture and elegance

946
02:00:08,334 --> 02:00:11,792
when you got out
of the carriage.

947
02:00:12,792 --> 02:00:14,917
Is this yours, Don Lopez?

948
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:18,709
Yes.

949
02:00:19,251 --> 02:00:23,459
Great. I collect coins.

950
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:26,584
Here. Take one.

951
02:00:28,084 --> 02:00:31,709
A collector always has two pieces,

952
02:00:32,126 --> 02:00:35,667
in case one gets lost.

953
02:00:36,251 --> 02:00:40,876
And a third one for exchange.

954
02:00:42,459 --> 02:00:46,042
Don Roque, I just arrived.

955
02:00:46,292 --> 02:00:49,209
I'm tired and hungry.

956
02:00:49,959 --> 02:00:51,417
Exactly.

957
02:01:00,084 --> 02:01:04,584
It's not very polite to eat
from one plate.

958
02:01:05,376 --> 02:01:09,876
Or to use one spoon or fork.

959
02:01:12,334 --> 02:01:15,167
- Boy!

960
02:01:15,792 --> 02:01:18,001
Set the table for one more.

961
02:01:18,251 --> 02:01:21,292
Hey, boy!
Set the table for one more!

962
02:01:25,167 --> 02:01:27,542
Busqueros entertained me...

963
02:01:31,584 --> 02:01:33,542
with gossip from Madrid.

964
02:01:33,792 --> 02:01:39,251
But I was impatiently looking
forward to going to Buen Retiro.

965
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:43,751
This remote park is described
in many love stories.

966
02:01:45,292 --> 02:01:52,751
I had a feeling I would start
a love relationship there.

967
02:02:24,876 --> 02:02:28,709
Madam, I think I found
what you are looking for.

968
02:02:28,959 --> 02:02:31,626
I lost a locket
with a piece of gold chain.

969
02:02:31,876 --> 02:02:34,167
Does it have an inscription?

970
02:02:35,167 --> 02:02:41,334
You read that my name is Inez.
It has my portrait.

971
02:02:41,584 --> 02:02:47,251
I want to remind you that
a finder usually gets a reward.

972
02:02:47,501 --> 02:02:50,042
Señor, you're too importunate
for a first meeting.

973
02:02:50,292 --> 02:02:54,584
Congratulations. You've met the son
of the richest merchant in Cadiz.

974
02:02:54,834 --> 02:02:58,501
Did I encourage
strangers to talk to me?

975
02:02:59,251 --> 02:03:01,292
Lopez Soarez.

976
02:03:01,542 --> 02:03:03,709
May I have my locket back?

977
02:03:14,084 --> 02:03:15,584
Go away!

978
02:03:46,167 --> 02:03:48,334
Señor Don Lopez.

979
02:03:48,584 --> 02:03:52,084
I rejected twenty invitations
and I came to see you.

980
02:03:52,334 --> 02:03:56,834
You must admit that I did you
a favour yesterday.

981
02:03:57,084 --> 02:04:02,876
I mentioned that you're the son
of one of the richest merchants.

982
02:04:06,376 --> 02:04:11,126
She pretended to be angry
only to convince you that

983
02:04:11,626 --> 02:04:15,376
wealth did not impress her.

984
02:04:17,542 --> 02:04:23,792
Don't believe it.
You're young, smart, handsome.

985
02:04:24,334 --> 02:04:28,834
But remember that gold
is never an obstacle in love.

986
02:04:36,959 --> 02:04:39,542
What will we do this afternoon?

987
02:04:41,126 --> 02:04:43,959
I want to see the city... alone.

988
02:04:44,459 --> 02:04:47,542
Señor, it was a deadlock.

989
02:04:49,501 --> 02:04:51,376
Go, you fool.

990
02:04:51,626 --> 02:04:53,917
33V your prayers!

991
02:05:12,334 --> 02:05:15,042
My brother gave me that locket.

992
02:05:23,042 --> 02:05:25,001
No more questions.

993
02:05:26,292 --> 02:05:27,459
But...

994
02:05:27,709 --> 02:05:30,709
Unless you find something
that belongs to me.

995
02:05:30,959 --> 02:05:34,459
Then you can claim a reward.

996
02:05:38,376 --> 02:05:40,834
We shouldn't be seen together.

997
02:05:48,417 --> 02:05:53,626
â€œLopez Soarez to..."

998
02:05:54,792 --> 02:05:56,376
What?

999
02:05:58,626 --> 02:06:00,251
â€œTo Inez.

1000
02:06:04,167 --> 02:06:09,167
I am charmed... comma.

1001
02:06:09,542 --> 02:06:12,626
And you are the sole reason of it.

1002
02:06:18,709 --> 02:06:24,167
I want to share
my thoughts in this letter,

1003
02:06:29,209 --> 02:06:31,917
but they seem to scatter".

1004
02:06:45,584 --> 02:06:47,292
I've got it.

1005
02:07:05,792 --> 02:07:08,417
Don Roque! Give it back!

1006
02:07:10,917 --> 02:07:12,292
Where are you?

1007
02:07:20,209 --> 02:07:21,459
Don Roque?

1008
02:07:21,709 --> 02:07:22,959
Don Lopez!

1009
02:07:27,126 --> 02:07:28,376
Stop!

1010
02:07:49,459 --> 02:07:53,459
Well? Your letter
has been delivered.

1011
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:57,834
You should be grateful, señor.

1012
02:08:15,876 --> 02:08:17,292
Madam...

1013
02:08:20,626 --> 02:08:26,542
Why did you use this impertinent
man to deliver your letter?

1014
02:08:27,417 --> 02:08:31,459
I wrote that letter
for my own pleasure.

1015
02:08:31,709 --> 02:08:33,834
He stole it from me.

1016
02:08:35,292 --> 02:08:40,417
Ever since I came to Madrid,
he haunts me like an evil spirit.

1017
02:08:40,667 --> 02:08:44,209
I shouldn't keep this nonsense.

1018
02:08:51,792 --> 02:08:54,834
What would you like to know?

1019
02:08:55,084 --> 02:08:59,167
I want to know who you are
and what is your name.

1020
02:08:59,417 --> 02:09:02,751
I'm the daughter of a man
who is as rich as your father.

1021
02:09:03,001 --> 02:09:06,084
- Banker Moro.
- Moro?

1022
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,042
- The curse of my life!
- Señor.

1023
02:09:10,292 --> 02:09:14,792
I can't even think about you
or my father will curse me.

1024
02:09:15,042 --> 02:09:18,334
He crossed many seas to be
a merchant in Cadiz.

1025
02:09:18,584 --> 02:09:19,876
In Cadiz...

1026
02:09:20,126 --> 02:09:24,751
Don't let that discourage you.
Rich men are hard to catch.

1027
02:09:25,001 --> 02:09:27,917
But sooner or later
they'll take the bait.

1028
02:09:29,209 --> 02:09:30,834
Stop it!

1029
02:09:31,084 --> 02:09:33,126
You'll scare my dog.

1030
02:09:34,001 --> 02:09:38,084
Only death is left for me.
May lightning strike me.

1031
02:09:38,667 --> 02:09:40,459
Don't be afraid.

1032
02:09:40,709 --> 02:09:43,542
- Inez loves you very much.
- Me?

1033
02:09:43,792 --> 02:09:48,792
She wants to meet you here,
tomorrow at sunset.

1034
02:10:27,001 --> 02:10:30,751
I understand that at your age
you don't want to get married.

1035
02:10:31,376 --> 02:10:34,209
But your excuse is strange.

1036
02:10:34,501 --> 02:10:39,459
The wrath of a father who crossed
many seas to be a merchant in Cadiz?

1037
02:10:39,709 --> 02:10:42,417
You're lucky.
I fixed everything.

1038
02:10:42,667 --> 02:10:48,042
Señor Don Roque,
can you do me another favour?

1039
02:10:48,584 --> 02:10:51,292
Don't go to Buen Retiro tonight.

1040
02:10:52,001 --> 02:10:53,792
Fair Inez won't be there.

1041
02:10:54,042 --> 02:10:59,667
But I want to sit on our bench
and wallow in my sorrow.

1042
02:11:01,501 --> 02:11:06,001
There's something offensive
in your words.

1043
02:11:06,251 --> 02:11:10,792
It looks like you don't appreciate
what I've do for you.

1044
02:11:11,042 --> 02:11:12,417
Señor"

1045
02:11:19,251 --> 02:11:23,167
"Jasmine exudes
its balmy fragrance.

1046
02:11:25,042 --> 02:11:27,501
Trees are getting greener.

1047
02:11:28,417 --> 02:11:31,334
All you did was walk under them.

1048
02:11:33,459 --> 02:11:37,167
What will become of a heart..."

1049
02:11:45,334 --> 02:11:48,959
I could let you wallow
in your sorrow alone.

1050
02:11:49,209 --> 02:11:51,334
But fair Inez may come.

1051
02:11:51,584 --> 02:11:54,001
Who will help you out?

1052
02:11:56,834 --> 02:11:58,459
What is this?

1053
02:12:00,042 --> 02:12:06,459
I'll tell you a story to kill time.
You may learn from it.

1054
02:12:07,001 --> 02:12:09,792
I always had talent
for studying law.

1055
02:12:10,042 --> 02:12:12,376
I was eager to know
people and life.

1056
02:12:50,792 --> 02:12:53,709
What is it?

1057
02:12:57,292 --> 02:12:59,667
The bloody head!

1058
02:13:20,417 --> 02:13:22,709
I took you for my relative.

1059
02:13:22,959 --> 02:13:25,626
We had something
important to discuss.

1060
02:13:26,542 --> 02:13:30,417
I don't know you or the reason
for this unexpected visit.

1061
02:13:30,667 --> 02:13:33,209
I didn't mean to enter your room.

1062
02:13:33,459 --> 02:13:36,626
I was just curious who lives here.

1063
02:13:36,876 --> 02:13:40,876
I'm a lawyer
and I study human life.

1064
02:13:41,376 --> 02:13:43,376
That makes a difference.

1065
02:13:43,626 --> 02:13:47,209
It's nice to know
what other people are doing.

1066
02:13:47,459 --> 02:13:49,792
Before you woke up, madam,

1067
02:13:50,042 --> 02:13:56,917
your husband did me the honour
of calling me "the bloody head".

1068
02:14:11,917 --> 02:14:15,709
- That woman...
- I don't have time for this.

1069
02:14:18,126 --> 02:14:22,376
When a decent man is telling you
a fascinating story,

1070
02:14:22,626 --> 02:14:24,459
you shouldn't interrupt.

1071
02:14:24,709 --> 02:14:26,709
No excuses!

1072
02:14:27,792 --> 02:14:29,334
That woman...

1073
02:14:31,584 --> 02:14:33,834
Let me explain.

1074
02:14:38,167 --> 02:14:44,459
I'm the daughter of a brave officer.
My name is Frasquetta Salero.

1075
02:14:48,084 --> 02:14:52,209
I started to attract men
as a young girl.

1076
02:14:52,542 --> 02:14:56,042
Frasquetta, be modest!

1077
02:14:57,251 --> 02:14:58,626
But morn!

1078
02:15:00,084 --> 02:15:05,542
How can I be impolite
to those elegant young men?

1079
02:15:23,917 --> 02:15:26,042
Did you drop something?

1080
02:15:27,792 --> 02:15:31,042
Too bad. If you had dropped
that cross pendant,

1081
02:15:31,292 --> 02:15:34,917
I'd pick it up and keep it
as a dear souvenir.

1082
02:15:44,501 --> 02:15:47,334
Frasquetta!
Get away from the window!

1083
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:19,751
Unfortunately that young man
never showed up again.

1084
02:16:24,542 --> 02:16:26,792
My lovely wife.

1085
02:16:29,834 --> 02:16:31,959
You're so beautiful.

1086
02:16:33,292 --> 02:16:36,959
- Do you love your hubby?
- I do.

1087
02:16:39,042 --> 02:16:42,917
- And nobody else?
- Nobody.

1088
02:16:59,667 --> 02:17:03,459
- What's that, boy?
- A letter for Madam Frasquetta.

1089
02:17:03,709 --> 02:17:05,167
Give it to me.

1090
02:17:06,334 --> 02:17:08,459
I'm her father.

1091
02:17:09,084 --> 02:17:10,501
Here.

1092
02:17:15,751 --> 02:17:19,626
A ring? What ring?

1093
02:17:21,209 --> 02:17:24,876
"I'm waiting and longing for you.
Pena Flor".

1094
02:17:36,042 --> 02:17:37,459
Frasquetta?

1095
02:17:38,209 --> 02:17:39,792
Do you love me?

1096
02:17:40,917 --> 02:17:42,334
I do.

1097
02:17:48,001 --> 02:17:51,834
Nothing will stand
in the way of our love.

1098
02:18:08,417 --> 02:18:10,084
Excellent, Don Ramiro!

1099
02:18:10,334 --> 02:18:14,292
If you're just as brave
with noble Count Pena Flor,

1100
02:18:14,542 --> 02:18:17,209
he will no longer be
a terror to husbands.

1101
02:18:17,459 --> 02:18:20,417
So what if I put an end
to his love conquests?

1102
02:18:20,667 --> 02:18:23,959
I'll have to suffer consequences
for this duel.

1103
02:18:25,459 --> 02:18:32,126
If I had one hundred doubloons,
I'd go and hide on an island.

1104
02:18:36,626 --> 02:18:40,209
I'll offer you one hundred doubloons
for this noble cause.

1105
02:19:16,626 --> 02:19:19,959
There was a murder yesterday.
It was Count...

1106
02:19:20,209 --> 02:19:21,334
Pena Flor.

1107
02:19:22,084 --> 02:19:26,167
We found a letter
on one of the thugs.

1108
02:19:26,417 --> 02:19:29,959
It said you offered

1109
02:19:30,251 --> 02:19:35,459
one hundred doubloons to kill him.

1110
02:19:35,876 --> 02:19:38,709
I never met Señor Pena Flor.

1111
02:19:39,626 --> 02:19:43,501
Yesterday two men came
with a promissory note for that sum,

1112
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:46,542
which I signed a year ago.

1113
02:19:47,376 --> 02:19:49,084
You want to see it?

1114
02:19:49,334 --> 02:19:54,417
I'm from the criminal court.
I'm not interested in transactions.

1115
02:19:54,667 --> 02:19:56,667
I have no further questions.

1116
02:19:56,917 --> 02:19:59,167
Sorry for bothering you.

1117
02:20:09,001 --> 02:20:14,584
Did you really pay somebody
to kill that señor?

1118
02:20:14,834 --> 02:20:17,001
Why? You don't know him.

1119
02:20:21,667 --> 02:20:26,376
I would go on a pilgrimage
to St. Jacob of Compostella,

1120
02:20:26,876 --> 02:20:32,542
or even further,
if I believed it would help me.

1121
02:20:33,751 --> 02:20:35,459
- Nice story.
- Yes.

1122
02:20:36,042 --> 02:20:41,751
Strange things have been happening
in our house ever since.

1123
02:20:53,876 --> 02:20:58,334
Take your
one hundred doubloons back!

1124
02:21:17,667 --> 02:21:19,167
Don Diego!

1125
02:21:38,459 --> 02:21:39,751
I like that.

1126
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:42,459
Needless to say,

1127
02:21:42,709 --> 02:21:47,626
I made up Count Pena Flor
to upset my husband

1128
02:21:47,876 --> 02:21:52,667
and make him go on a pilgrimage.

1129
02:21:54,001 --> 02:21:58,959
The justice clerks
and the thugs were paid people.

1130
02:21:59,417 --> 02:22:02,376
Now I get it. The bloody head!

1131
02:22:05,751 --> 02:22:09,459
I took you for somebody else.

1132
02:22:09,876 --> 02:22:11,251
Enough!

1133
02:22:11,501 --> 02:22:15,334
- I haven't finished yet.
- Later. Duty calls.

1134
02:22:15,584 --> 02:22:18,126
Señor Don Lopez,
do you want to offend me?

1135
02:22:18,376 --> 02:22:21,667
Yes. There is no other way
to get rid of you.

1136
02:22:26,001 --> 02:22:29,292
Your daddy will be glad.

1137
02:22:47,542 --> 02:22:51,292
So where was I?

1138
02:22:53,959 --> 02:23:00,376
That very night I found myself
in totally different circumstances.

1139
02:23:09,834 --> 02:23:13,709
You're lucky it's only an injury.
I could have killed you.

1140
02:23:14,876 --> 02:23:20,834
Easy. I'll take care of everything.
Don't worry.

1141
02:23:21,417 --> 02:23:27,667
It's a pity you interrupted my story.
It was getting interesting.

1142
02:23:28,417 --> 02:23:30,042
Listen.

1143
02:23:30,292 --> 02:23:35,792
That very night I found myself
in totally different circumstances.

1144
02:24:10,126 --> 02:24:11,751
What happened?

1145
02:24:12,001 --> 02:24:14,126
Señor Don Lopez.

1146
02:24:21,292 --> 02:24:23,834
Don't strain yourself.

1147
02:24:32,626 --> 02:24:35,042
- It's long.
- Who is it from?

1148
02:24:35,292 --> 02:24:37,292
Don't be a child.

1149
02:24:37,542 --> 02:24:41,501
It's from fair Inez.
It's settled.

1150
02:24:41,751 --> 02:24:42,959
What is it?

1151
02:24:43,209 --> 02:24:46,959
She wants you to meet her
at her place tonight.

1152
02:24:47,209 --> 02:24:49,917
The wedding is tomorrow.
Happy?

1153
02:24:50,167 --> 02:24:53,126
What place?
The Moro house? How?

1154
02:24:53,376 --> 02:24:56,042
- Well?
- The usual way.

1155
02:24:56,417 --> 02:25:00,001
- Their house is guarded.
- The tried way.

1156
02:25:00,334 --> 02:25:01,959
Take it easy.

1157
02:25:02,209 --> 02:25:04,084
I'll take care of it.

1158
02:25:05,209 --> 02:25:10,417
I don't know what you
would do without me.

1159
02:25:35,959 --> 02:25:37,042
Which window?

1160
02:25:37,459 --> 02:25:40,667
One, two, three.
The third one.

1161
02:25:40,917 --> 02:25:42,292
Which one?

1162
02:25:43,292 --> 02:25:44,584
The third!

1163
02:25:51,334 --> 02:25:54,542
- This is the window of fair Inez.
- My heart is pounding.

1164
02:25:54,792 --> 02:25:59,001
I'm touched, señor.
Please don't embarrass me.

1165
02:25:59,251 --> 02:26:01,042
I'm really grateful.

1166
02:26:01,292 --> 02:26:04,667
You have to go for it.

1167
02:26:04,917 --> 02:26:05,959
Yes.

1168
02:26:06,209 --> 02:26:10,917
When I clap my hands,
enter the heavens.

1169
02:26:11,334 --> 02:26:13,334
- Ready?
- Yes.

1170
02:26:23,876 --> 02:26:25,001
Up!

1171
02:26:26,126 --> 02:26:29,792
Balmy fragrance... jasmine.

1172
02:26:30,251 --> 02:26:31,792
Oh God!

1173
02:26:49,542 --> 02:26:51,251
Are you gone?

1174
02:26:52,792 --> 02:26:54,917
Yes!

1175
02:26:56,376 --> 02:27:01,251
Is there purgatory
in the other world?

1176
02:27:04,542 --> 02:27:07,834
Yes! That's where I am!

1177
02:27:13,584 --> 02:27:15,334
Was there a storm that night?

1178
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:19,126
Lightning was flashing.
He got the wrong window.

1179
02:27:19,376 --> 02:27:22,709
Señor
I found the purgatorial soul!

1180
02:27:22,959 --> 02:27:24,126
Where?

1181
02:27:25,709 --> 02:27:27,792
What are you talking about?

1182
02:27:54,542 --> 02:27:56,167
Señor Toledo.

1183
02:27:59,709 --> 02:28:01,834
Listen.

1184
02:28:07,834 --> 02:28:09,167
No.

1185
02:28:12,584 --> 02:28:15,251
I'm ending my penance.

1186
02:28:19,542 --> 02:28:22,001
How did you find out?

1187
02:28:22,751 --> 02:28:24,834
Lopez Soarez told me.

1188
02:28:26,001 --> 02:28:29,626
- A merchant from Cadiz.
- How did it happen?

1189
02:28:29,876 --> 02:28:34,167
- Busqueros got the wrong window.
- Busqueros? Right.

1190
02:28:34,417 --> 02:28:35,876
Never met him.

1191
02:28:36,126 --> 02:28:40,084
Tell him to drop by.
I want to know the details.

1192
02:28:45,876 --> 02:28:51,334
You think that lady who gave you
her glove is still faithful to me?

1193
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:53,834
- I'm sure.
- Farewell.

1194
02:29:00,292 --> 02:29:05,084
I decided to find that nuisance
of a man known in Madrid.

1195
02:29:08,209 --> 02:29:10,501
Please don't stop now.

1196
02:29:10,751 --> 02:29:14,792
Allow me to devote a few
minutes to that man.

1197
02:29:19,167 --> 02:29:24,459
Frasquetta told her story
to Busqueros.

1198
02:29:24,792 --> 02:29:28,376
He told it to Lopez Soarez,

1199
02:29:29,167 --> 02:29:33,209
who told it to Señor Avadoro.

1200
02:29:34,334 --> 02:29:35,459
It's crazy.

1201
02:29:36,584 --> 02:29:41,417
When these stories begin,
the listener thinks they'll end.

1202
02:29:41,667 --> 02:29:45,542
But one story creates
another story and another.

1203
02:29:45,792 --> 02:29:50,417
Like quotients
which can be divided infinitely.

1204
02:29:51,417 --> 02:29:54,709
I'm captain of the guard,
not a philosopher.

1205
02:29:54,959 --> 02:29:57,501
Your math is dead numbers.

1206
02:29:58,167 --> 02:29:59,834
Dead numbers?

1207
02:30:00,084 --> 02:30:02,292
Zero, plus and minus one

1208
02:30:02,584 --> 02:30:06,167
gave Archimedes and Newton
power equal to the gods.

1209
02:30:06,501 --> 02:30:09,751
Very noble people.
What's the point of this?

1210
02:30:17,376 --> 02:30:22,959
We are like blind men lost
in the streets of a strange city.

1211
02:30:24,292 --> 02:30:27,917
The streets lead to somewhere,

1212
02:30:28,209 --> 02:30:35,001
but we go back to the same
places to get to our destination.

1213
02:30:36,917 --> 02:30:42,334
I see a few streets here
which lead to nowhere.

1214
02:30:44,459 --> 02:30:49,209
If you find new combinations,
everything will be clear.

1215
02:30:49,834 --> 02:30:55,917
Whatever man invents,
man can work out.

1216
02:30:57,626 --> 02:31:00,209
I admit I don't follow.

1217
02:31:00,792 --> 02:31:02,876
Let's listen.

1218
02:31:04,459 --> 02:31:08,709
Cavalier Toledo became
his own happy self again.

1219
02:31:09,292 --> 02:31:13,917
I went to look for
that nuisance of a man.

1220
02:31:15,751 --> 02:31:19,667
I happened to meet him
that very day.

1221
02:31:50,917 --> 02:31:53,626
I like you.
You can be my servant.

1222
02:31:54,626 --> 02:31:59,501
Be thankful. New prospects
are opening up before you.

1223
02:32:00,167 --> 02:32:03,459
I bet you haven't met
many noblemen.

1224
02:32:04,751 --> 02:32:09,834
I can prove that I was
raised like a nobleman.

1225
02:32:10,501 --> 02:32:17,084
I wasn't born a beggar.
It's a twist of fate.

1226
02:32:18,667 --> 02:32:19,709
Good.

1227
02:32:23,542 --> 02:32:26,042
Let's go, señor.

1228
02:32:39,292 --> 02:32:42,459
You may not like
your duties at first.

1229
02:32:42,709 --> 02:32:45,459
You won't be paid.

1230
02:32:45,917 --> 02:32:51,542
Or get new clothes.
As far as board...

1231
02:32:51,792 --> 02:32:57,501
Aren't you Señor Don Busqueros,
who helped Lopez Soarez?

1232
02:32:58,251 --> 02:32:59,792
Yes. That's me.

1233
02:33:00,042 --> 02:33:03,417
There would be a happy end
if it weren't for the storm.

1234
02:33:03,667 --> 02:33:07,084
I got the wrong window.
But I'm not through yet.

1235
02:33:07,334 --> 02:33:10,167
Cavalier Toledo
would like to meet you, señor.

1236
02:33:10,417 --> 02:33:13,751
Toledo? I'm honoured.

1237
02:33:14,001 --> 02:33:19,501
I found out that Lopez's father
came from Cadiz and is staying...

1238
02:33:19,751 --> 02:33:21,084
in this house.

1239
02:33:21,334 --> 02:33:24,459
He waited for his son in vain
and went out. Where?

1240
02:33:24,709 --> 02:33:28,626
Where can a provincial man go to?
Well?

1241
02:33:28,876 --> 02:33:33,292
- To see the church.
- Wrong, you noble tramp.

1242
02:33:34,667 --> 02:33:36,834
- To the tavern.
- Which one?

1243
02:33:37,084 --> 02:33:38,834
The nearest one.

1244
02:34:06,209 --> 02:34:08,459
Señor, it's not possible.

1245
02:34:11,459 --> 02:34:15,209
You must admit Cadiz
is more important than Madrid.

1246
02:34:15,459 --> 02:34:17,917
What's more, Soarez,
who was short of funds,

1247
02:34:18,167 --> 02:34:22,209
could do his trading
owing to Levardez.

1248
02:34:22,626 --> 02:34:26,834
Later Moro, his beneficiary, had to go
to court to get his money back.

1249
02:34:27,084 --> 02:34:28,251
The trial is still going on.

1250
02:34:28,501 --> 02:34:32,834
No. Soarez sued banker Moro
to make him accept

1251
02:34:33,084 --> 02:34:36,417
not one but two million profit.

1252
02:34:36,876 --> 02:34:42,584
The Soarez family is one
of the most respectable in Spain.

1253
02:34:42,834 --> 02:34:46,126
It's a fact.
You have a big mouth. Go away.

1254
02:34:52,334 --> 02:34:56,334
I see that you're
an honest merchant.

1255
02:34:57,792 --> 02:35:03,001
Your words do me honour.
I'm Gaspar Soarez from Cadiz.

1256
02:35:03,584 --> 02:35:05,459
My name is Moraredo.

1257
02:35:05,709 --> 02:35:07,459
You are a godsend.

1258
02:35:08,126 --> 02:35:13,126
I can tell that you're
a true connoisseur of life.

1259
02:35:13,417 --> 02:35:15,209
I'm at your service.

1260
02:35:15,792 --> 02:35:19,251
I sent my son here and I forbade
him to use the tile of "Don".

1261
02:35:19,501 --> 02:35:22,084
- To associate with noblemen.
- Very wise.

1262
02:35:22,334 --> 02:35:24,542
- And to use the sword.
- I understand.

1263
02:35:24,792 --> 02:35:27,792
But my Lopez is Don Lopez now.

1264
02:35:28,209 --> 02:35:33,167
The only man he is close
with is a nobleman Busqueros.

1265
02:35:33,417 --> 02:35:34,751
Unbelievable.

1266
02:35:35,001 --> 02:35:38,501
He had a duel with him
and was thrown out of the window.

1267
02:35:40,876 --> 02:35:43,251
I want to marry him off.

1268
02:35:44,834 --> 02:35:49,584
Do you know any young lady
from a respectable family?

1269
02:35:49,834 --> 02:35:52,584
I do.

1270
02:35:53,167 --> 02:35:56,334
Her father, a noble merchant,
is very angry.

1271
02:35:56,584 --> 02:35:58,751
He said he would lock her away
in a monastery

1272
02:35:59,001 --> 02:36:01,834
if she didn't pick
a husband this week.

1273
02:36:02,084 --> 02:36:06,042
- I'd like to talk to her.
- You'll meet her today.

1274
02:36:07,167 --> 02:36:08,667
In an inn?

1275
02:36:08,917 --> 02:36:14,042
- A lady from a respectable family?
- Incognito. Time is short.

1276
02:36:15,251 --> 02:36:18,376
Señor is paying. Goodbye.

1277
02:36:26,376 --> 02:36:31,001
Today you'll understand
the true value of my friendship.

1278
02:36:39,626 --> 02:36:45,959
You must admit that I'm good
at dealing with problems.

1279
02:36:53,709 --> 02:36:58,001
I judge from the way
you stood up for me that you're

1280
02:36:58,251 --> 02:37:02,376
an expert on merchant matters.

1281
02:37:02,626 --> 02:37:06,042
- Excuse me, señor...
- Moraredo.

1282
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:11,334
But your name is not known
in merchant circles.

1283
02:37:11,834 --> 02:37:13,584
You know, señor...

1284
02:37:13,834 --> 02:37:17,334
I assume you didn't have
a chance to try

1285
02:37:17,584 --> 02:37:22,126
your hand at a business
of your own.

1286
02:37:31,501 --> 02:37:35,126
Impertinence is not why I'm here.

1287
02:37:35,959 --> 02:37:41,334
I came because my father's anger
forces me to seek salvation.

1288
02:37:42,792 --> 02:37:48,251
- I respect the Soarez family.
- I am honoured, my lady.

1289
02:37:51,001 --> 02:37:53,459
You want to marry Miss Moro?

1290
02:37:54,042 --> 02:37:55,751
Miss Moro?

1291
02:37:57,001 --> 02:37:59,501
Aren't your intentions serious?

1292
02:37:59,876 --> 02:38:01,709
It's a misunderstanding!

1293
02:38:02,042 --> 02:38:05,917
If you can kneel before my sister,
you're not too old to fight me.

1294
02:38:06,167 --> 02:38:07,626
Get your sword
or jump out the window!

1295
02:38:07,876 --> 02:38:10,792
- What?
- Your honour is at stake.

1296
02:38:26,334 --> 02:38:27,584
Daddy!

1297
02:38:31,876 --> 02:38:35,459
Son, I forbade you to associate
with noblemen.

1298
02:38:35,709 --> 02:38:38,667
Daddy, it's just one.
He's standing next to you.

1299
02:38:38,917 --> 02:38:41,042
You shouldn't have fought
a duel with him.

1300
02:38:41,292 --> 02:38:44,542
Mind you, señor.
You're holding a sword.

1301
02:38:49,667 --> 02:38:51,251
Lopez, Lopez"

1302
02:38:51,501 --> 02:38:53,751
Why did you choose Miss Moro?

1303
02:38:54,001 --> 02:38:58,042
Señor, you were just kneeling
at her feet yourself.

1304
02:39:05,917 --> 02:39:12,042
Señor Gaspar Soarez,
punishment fits the crime.

1305
02:39:12,292 --> 02:39:16,834
We would be honoured if your son
asked for my daughter's hand.

1306
02:39:17,084 --> 02:39:20,459
Instead he chose to sneak
in through the window.

1307
02:39:20,709 --> 02:39:26,917
I'm sure it was all because of
that dispute over the two million,

1308
02:39:27,167 --> 02:39:29,292
which you think I should accept.

1309
02:39:29,542 --> 02:39:30,626
Yes.

1310
02:39:30,876 --> 02:39:35,334
I will. Provided I can add
another two million

1311
02:39:35,584 --> 02:39:40,084
and give it to your son
along with my daughter's hand.

1312
02:39:52,417 --> 02:39:54,292
You did a good job.

1313
02:39:59,376 --> 02:40:02,292
Well done, señor.

1314
02:40:02,542 --> 02:40:05,792
It's easy to see
how this story goes on.

1315
02:40:06,709 --> 02:40:10,167
Lopez moved to his future
father in law's house.

1316
02:40:10,417 --> 02:40:14,626
Inez will see to it
that he gets well.

1317
02:40:15,709 --> 02:40:20,126
I want to hear more
about that love affair.

1318
02:40:21,834 --> 02:40:28,751
Was this woman Frasquetta
really so enticing?

1319
02:40:31,751 --> 02:40:36,501
I told that story
to a young merchant.

1320
02:40:36,751 --> 02:40:40,542
Yes. Lopez Soarez passed it
on to my friend.

1321
02:40:41,126 --> 02:40:43,584
That's how I heard about it.

1322
02:40:43,834 --> 02:40:46,459
Your memory is admirable.

1323
02:40:46,709 --> 02:40:51,751
Since you know her story,
I'll tell you about her husband

1324
02:40:52,001 --> 02:40:58,959
and how he got to meet
one unfortunate man.

1325
02:40:59,209 --> 02:41:01,001
Go on.

1326
02:41:01,709 --> 02:41:06,626
That very night I found myself
in totally different circumstance.

1327
02:43:17,084 --> 02:43:18,292
Who are you?

1328
02:43:18,542 --> 02:43:21,126
See this sign? Satan sent me.

1329
02:43:21,376 --> 02:43:27,001
- Stop tormenting me!
- What do you mean?

1330
02:43:27,292 --> 02:43:28,917
What about
the one hundred doubloons

1331
02:43:29,167 --> 02:43:30,834
that you paid for the head
of Count Pena Flor?

1332
02:43:31,084 --> 02:43:32,334
What do you want?

1333
02:43:32,959 --> 02:43:34,417
See this?

1334
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:40,584
Before he died, he outbid you.

1335
02:43:43,376 --> 02:43:44,709
Don't stab me!

1336
02:44:04,834 --> 02:44:08,459
That was quite an hour.

1337
02:44:08,792 --> 02:44:11,126
You didn't disappoint me.

1338
02:44:11,376 --> 02:44:16,251
Excuse me for telling
things that are sinful.

1339
02:44:16,501 --> 02:44:19,709
But you can learn a lot
from that story.

1340
02:44:22,042 --> 02:44:24,876
What happened to Madam Cornandez?

1341
02:44:25,126 --> 02:44:27,459
She became a widow.

1342
02:44:27,917 --> 02:44:32,459
Later she married her lover
and leads a blameless life.

1343
02:44:32,751 --> 02:44:33,959
There she is!

1344
02:44:36,251 --> 02:44:39,584
What? it's Dona Uscariz.

1345
02:44:40,709 --> 02:44:42,251
Frasquetta.

1346
02:44:49,126 --> 02:44:50,626
Help!

1347
02:44:53,084 --> 02:44:55,917
- I can't.
- Out the window!

1348
02:44:58,917 --> 02:45:03,251
- She said I was her only lover.
- There are other women.

1349
02:45:12,626 --> 02:45:13,834
Toledo?

1350
02:45:14,084 --> 02:45:17,042
- Señor Toledo!
- Run!

1351
02:45:18,834 --> 02:45:20,084
Don't panic!

1352
02:45:36,292 --> 02:45:38,584
I have to think it over.

1353
02:45:38,834 --> 02:45:40,626
Carefully this time.

1354
02:45:41,876 --> 02:45:44,959
- Señor!
- Farewell, my friends!

1355
02:45:45,209 --> 02:45:46,709
- Your sword.
- No.

1356
02:45:57,042 --> 02:46:00,084
His life is quite exhausting.

1357
02:46:00,334 --> 02:46:04,084
Don't you think there should be
a ladder under every window?

1358
02:46:06,542 --> 02:46:08,209
Just in case.

1359
02:46:27,209 --> 02:46:28,417
What's going on?

1360
02:46:28,667 --> 02:46:31,667
Officers of the guard are
sorting out their differences.

1361
02:46:51,876 --> 02:46:56,667
- It must be a serious dilemma.
- There were other reasons.

1362
02:47:09,459 --> 02:47:13,959
- You stand by your word?
- I never take back what I say.

1363
02:47:33,376 --> 02:47:38,959
If I'm not mistaken,
that brave officer was your father.

1364
02:47:48,834 --> 02:47:53,501
The chronicle of his duels
mentions it.

1365
02:47:53,751 --> 02:47:58,751
To avoid feuds,
he had two duels that day.

1366
02:48:00,959 --> 02:48:03,792
He wounded five men
in the afternoon.

1367
02:48:04,042 --> 02:48:07,292
And six in the evening.

1368
02:48:07,542 --> 02:48:10,334
He did the right thing.
Why get into feuds?

1369
02:48:12,417 --> 02:48:14,751
This is the end of the story.

1370
02:48:15,459 --> 02:48:18,001
You wanted to hear my adventures.

1371
02:48:18,251 --> 02:48:21,334
I hope your curiosity paid off.

1372
02:48:22,917 --> 02:48:24,667
It's time to say goodbye.

1373
02:48:24,917 --> 02:48:30,042
Saying goodbye, excuse me,

1374
02:48:30,417 --> 02:48:32,917
can be a sweet experience.

1375
02:48:33,167 --> 02:48:34,542
Señor

1376
02:48:38,667 --> 02:48:41,292
Important matters are calling.

1377
02:49:00,167 --> 02:49:02,834
But you said...

1378
02:49:16,042 --> 02:49:19,834
I don't think you have much
time left, señor.

1379
02:51:33,542 --> 02:51:36,459
Alfonse van Worden,
we're waiting for you.

1380
02:51:39,126 --> 02:51:41,584
- Who are you?
- My name will tell you nothing.

1381
02:51:41,834 --> 02:51:44,209
Welcome to Gomelez land.

1382
02:53:01,626 --> 02:53:04,876
You remember me as the hermit.

1383
02:53:05,126 --> 02:53:10,126
Now you see I'm the Gomelez sheik.

1384
02:53:12,126 --> 02:53:17,876
You're here because you
haven't failed our hopes.

1385
02:53:23,751 --> 02:53:26,292
I'm captain of the guard.

1386
02:53:26,751 --> 02:53:30,751
It's time to reveal our secret.

1387
02:53:32,542 --> 02:53:36,126
The Prophet has blessed your love.

1388
02:53:37,334 --> 02:53:41,126
They will both be mothers soon.

1389
02:53:42,209 --> 02:53:45,126
We'll preserve our family line.

1390
02:53:55,292 --> 02:53:58,792
We deceived you
for quite a long time.

1391
02:53:59,042 --> 02:54:01,084
We wanted to be sure that

1392
02:54:01,334 --> 02:54:05,542
your first night at Venta Quemada
would bear fruit.

1393
02:54:06,459 --> 02:54:12,834
You're the only male descendant
of our vanishing family line.

1394
02:54:15,667 --> 02:54:19,667
Everything you experienced
was a planned game.

1395
02:54:19,917 --> 02:54:24,126
We wanted to test
your honour and courage.

1396
02:54:28,209 --> 02:54:32,376
So the ghosts and evil spirits
were your men?

1397
02:54:34,876 --> 02:54:38,001
- What about the kabbalist?
- That's right.

1398
02:54:38,251 --> 02:54:42,542
So was Pacheco.
He is a Basque acrobat.

1399
02:54:43,917 --> 02:54:49,584
He lost an eye
while performing a dangerous trick.

1400
02:54:53,876 --> 02:54:58,459
And Velasquez?
I won't believe it.

1401
02:54:59,417 --> 02:55:00,709
Yes.

1402
02:55:00,959 --> 02:55:03,751
This skeptic caused us
a lot of trouble.

1403
02:55:04,001 --> 02:55:07,126
But we rest our hopes
with Rebecca.

1404
02:55:07,542 --> 02:55:12,501
You'll find everything you saw
and experienced in this book.

1405
02:55:12,751 --> 02:55:15,792
Maybe I can finally sort it all out.

1406
02:55:25,251 --> 02:55:27,709
You can write the rest yourself.

1407
02:55:28,417 --> 02:55:33,751
May Allah cover your head
with the dew of happiness.

1408
02:55:38,876 --> 02:55:40,917
Kiss him, Zibelda.

1409
02:55:45,376 --> 02:55:49,001
I'll be happy to see him
in your embrace.

1410
02:55:56,417 --> 02:56:04,834
Every time I see you,
I'm afraid I won't see you again.

1411
02:56:06,126 --> 02:56:10,209
We may never meet again.

1412
02:56:10,459 --> 02:56:14,584
But we want to live in
your memory forever.

1413
02:56:16,042 --> 02:56:19,417
Saying goodbye can be
a sweet experience.

1414
02:56:20,917 --> 02:56:28,167
Now that I know everything,
can you tell me the truth?

1415
02:56:30,876 --> 02:56:31,959
Who are you?

1416
02:56:37,001 --> 02:56:38,501
Close your eyes.

1417
02:56:44,417 --> 02:56:48,126
When you hear your name,
follow us.

1418
02:57:01,126 --> 02:57:02,501
NOW?

1419
02:58:25,417 --> 02:58:28,084
Will we make it before night?

1420
02:58:29,667 --> 02:58:31,292
Yes.

1421
02:58:32,459 --> 02:58:35,709
This time we will.

1422
02:58:54,292 --> 02:58:57,834
- Where have you been?
- The mules ran away, señor.

1423
02:58:58,084 --> 02:59:01,292
Let's be on our way.
Hurry!

1424
02:59:38,209 --> 02:59:39,626
Reshoe him!

1425
02:59:59,209 --> 03:00:04,667
Comfort and peace -
that's what our inn offers.

1426
03:00:04,917 --> 03:00:11,751
For a long time
they thought I was doomed.

1427
03:00:12,376 --> 03:00:18,792
Everybody was overjoyed
when I arrived.

1428
03:00:19,042 --> 03:00:25,251
Only the sheik was sad to see me

1429
03:00:25,501 --> 03:00:27,917
weak and in poor health.

1430
03:00:29,126 --> 03:00:32,084
Dinner for the señor!
Quick!

1431
03:00:35,126 --> 03:00:42,584
Two foreign ladies staying
in this inn invite you to supper.

1432
03:00:44,626 --> 03:00:46,084
What? Where?

1433
03:02:02,417 --> 03:02:06,626
THE END

1434
03:02:08,459 --> 03:02:13,667

11
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,073
Who is this guy again?

12
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,783
Name is Szczuka.

13
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,162
The Communist Party's Secretary
of the Province.

14
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,136
- Sir...
- Get lost!

15
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,673
Could you open the chapel
for me, please, sir?

16
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,268
It's locked, see.

17
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,823
Run away!

18
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,869
- What now?
- They're coming.

19
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,667
I am used to waiting for bigger things.

20
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,799
- Hurry up!
- Bloody ants!

21
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,431
Hurry up! Run!

22
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,022
Guys, hurry up! They're coming! Hurry!

23
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,594
- Take his papers!
- He hasn't got any.

24
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,220
Jesus! Mary! Let's run away!

25
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,266
Stop!

26
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,856
Where are you going?

27
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,359
Wait!

28
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,818
What's this?

29
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,572
Two of ours have just been killed.

30
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,908
Smolarski from cement plant
member of Workers' Council.

31
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,951
And that one?

32
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:14,498
Also from the plant.
Gawlik, not yet twenty.

33
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,793
He came back from labour camp
in Germany a week ago.

34
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,005
Came back home to die.

35
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,136
That's where the scoundrels shot from!

36
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,187
The two of us were meant
to be killed, not them.

37
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,857
- You think so?
- Naturally.

38
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,526
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,370
Excuse me, comrade.

40
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,123
My name is Szczuka.

41
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,670
So you're the Party Secretary
we've been expecting.

42
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,713
That's me.

43
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:07,844
I have a question. We all do, that is.

44
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:13,934
Tell us, how long will such men
continue to be killed?

45
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,684
They're not the first.

46
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,646
Nor the last. Are you scared?

47
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,731
Everyone wants to live.

48
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,692
Haven't we lost enough people?

49
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,403
Smolarski lost two sons.

50
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,742
One in 1939, the other
was shot here by the Germans in 1943.

51
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,827
And now it was him.

52
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:37,540
Why? Who killed him?

53
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,334
Poles?

54
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,296
How long is this going to take?

55
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,972
It would be wrong for a communist
to console you like children.

56
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,392
The war is over, but our struggle is not.

57
00:07:56,226 --> 00:08:01,439
The struggle for the future of our country
has just begun.

58
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:07,904
Today, tomorrow or the day after
any of us can be killed.

59
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,617
We understand you,

60
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,037
but what do we tell his wife?

61
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,456
What can we say?

62
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,043
It's not easy for me, comrades,

63
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,798
as I know it was me they meant to kill,

64
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,217
not the two of them.

65
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:34,014
Heads up! We must do our thing
as long as we live.

66
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,640
That's what really matters.

67
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,561
This is a special announcement:

68
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,730
Today, on May 8,

69
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:46,025
among the ruins of Berlin,

70
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,945
the German High Command signed an accord

71
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,825
of an unconditional surrender of Germany.

72
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,037
The German High Command

73
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,873
was represented by:

74
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,710
Keitel, Friedeburg and Stumpf.

75
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:11,133
On behalf of the Red Army Command,

76
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,220
Marshal Zhukov.

77
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,225
Where is he?

78
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,439
He should be here by now.

79
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,566
Where does he get the information?

80
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,609
From his boss.

81
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,277
Who's that?

82
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,281
The mayor. The moron is his secretary.

83
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:37,035
So he works for both sides?
I hate such things.

84
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,086
Can he be trusted?

85
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,253
And who is?

86
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,049
Look at the tanks. Not bad at all.

87
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,933
Polish tanks head for the battlefield...

88
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,478
Take a look!

89
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,230
Welcome, gentlemen.

90
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,067
- You're late. Did anything happen?
- I just had to change.

91
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,112
- You're getting married?
- Nothing of the sort.

92
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,740
I'm in charge of the whole banquet, look!

93
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,742
Give me that.

94
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,995
The pictures not clear, it's too early.

95
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:26,250
Count me out when you plan such actions.

96
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,126
OK, don't bother.

97
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,795
Information? OK.
But nothing of that sort.

98
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,506
Don't bother me. Maciek?

99
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,674
- Yes?
- We're off.

100
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,218
- Where to?
- We're invited to a banquet.

101
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,887
No kidding?

102
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,473
Don't worry. I know what I am doing.

103
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,644
- The risk is pointless.
- Stop bothering me.

104
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,814
- Bye.
- Bye.

105
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,024
Good evening, sir.

106
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,989
Look, who's here!

107
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,243
- What brings you here?
- Duties, Mr. Kotowicz, duties.

108
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:47,080
I see. The banquet.
You're looking for the manager?

109
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,459
You'll certainly find him here.

110
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,379
A masterpiece! You can trust me on that!

111
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,708
Hello. How you doing?

112
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,379
I hope the mayor will be satisfied.

113
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,966
He really hopes everything will be perfect.

114
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,929
I see, the end of the war.
A very special moment.

115
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,725
A private passage to the toilet.

116
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,727
How are things?

117
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,190
Thank you, sir. All quiet.

118
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,867
It looks fine to me.

119
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,869
Rest assured, Secretary,

120
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,498
it will taste even better.

121
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,711
Let's go.

122
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,714
- Do you see that pretty girl?
- Come on.

123
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,049
Let's have a drink.

124
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,354
Good evening. Can we have something to drink?

125
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,315
What will you have?

126
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,692
Two vodkas straight will be OK.

127
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,276
Miss Krystyna!

128
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,653
Yes, sir?

129
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,697
Krystyna, such a pretty name.

130
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,949
- Stop fooling around.
- But I'm not.

131
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,369
Drink it up and we're off.

132
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,289
Two double vodkas and sodas.

133
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,917
A pretty bar you have here, you know?

134
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,473
When do you close?

135
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,768
At 3 a.m.

136
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,063
Do you like violets?

137
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,315
Very much.

138
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,775
So do I.

139
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,836
- Did you see them?
- What?

140
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,671
Almost like girls from Warsaw.
I wish I could stay.

141
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,174
- Then stay.
- It's easy to say.

142
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,301
There's no one waiting for you there.

143
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,096
That's why there is no point in staying.

144
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,807
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

145
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,852
It must be our master.

146
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,275
Wait. It's all right.

147
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:35,870
Hello... Yes...
This is Mrs. Staniewicz speaking.

148
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,080
I'll put you through.

149
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,895
Major! It's for you.

150
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,033
This is Andrzej speaking.

151
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,498
It's done and over with, sir.

152
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,544
Everything is in order. Yes.

153
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,214
No complications, none whatsoever.

154
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,760
Yes... yes.

155
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,554
Good evening.

156
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,431
Have you got the room for Comrade Szczuka?

157
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,726
It was booked by the Town Committee.

158
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:47,108
Naturally! We have for you
room 18 on the 2nd floor.

159
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,150
Here you are.

160
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:50,736
Yes...

161
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,073
Yes.

162
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,993
A moment...

163
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,541
What's the matter with you? Are you there?

164
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,502
I don't get it.

165
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,797
The business fell through...

166
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,343
Yes, I see.

167
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,640
What can we do?
Well, come over immediately.

168
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,740
- Have you got any cigarettes?
- American? Hungarian?

169
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,577
- American will be fine.
- Here you are.

170
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,414
Thank you.

171
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,750
Wait for me at the bar.

172
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,336
No problem,
I am used to waiting for bigger things.

173
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,004
Do you know the Staniewicz family?

174
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,505
Yes, sir.

175
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,382
They live at their old address?

176
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,886
Yes. Not far from here.

177
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,805
They have a phone. Should I call them?

178
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,558
Here you are.

179
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,108
Thank you.

180
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,278
This is their phone number - 1214.

181
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,365
Here you are, sir, your key.

182
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,245
So at what time is this banquet?
At 11 p.m.?

183
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,082
Yes. The car will be waiting.

184
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,171
How can I help you?

185
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,385
A pack of cigarettes, please.

186
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,722
- American or Hungarian?
- Hungarian, they are stronger.

187
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,392
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

188
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,686
- Here.
- Let me get your change.

189
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,105
No, please, keep it.

190
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,982
Will you smoke?

191
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,736
No, thank you.

192
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,406
Too strong for me. I cough. At my age...

193
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,032
Come on. How old are you?

194
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,327
- Almost sixty.
- You don't even look fifty to me.

195
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,205
You are very kind. Alone?

196
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,833
For the time being.

197
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,418
A blonde?

198
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,712
Why not?

199
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:18,591
Doubles are always difficult.

200
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,304
I am OK with a single.
The more intimate the better.

201
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,015
- Are you from Warsaw by any chance?
- Exactly.

202
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:30,312
So am I. I used to work at the Savoy.

203
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,024
- In Nowy Swiat St.?
- Exactly.

204
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,694
I was two months short of 25 years.

205
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,572
You lived there through the Rising?

206
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,367
Downtown to the last day. And you?

207
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:47,829
Here are there. The Old Town first,
next downtown... You know...

208
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:53,544
Without Warsaw we are not the same.

209
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,713
As if we missed an arm.

210
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:01,886
The chestnuts are in bloom now
in the parks and avenues.

211
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,972
In bloom, you say?

212
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:11,187
I though I would put you up
in a bedbug-ridden room on the 3th floor...

213
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,607
- I will give a room on the 2nd. Number 17.
- Thank you.

214
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,527
You deserve it.
We Varsovians must stick together.

215
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,904
Any luggage?

216
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,822
- Just this.
- Not much.

217
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,658
I used to have even less.

218
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,244
Here you are.

219
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,915
- My ID.
- Oh, a Kenkarte.

220
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,294
- Chełmicki Maciej.
- Yes.

221
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,422
Born in Warsaw in 1921.

222
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,010
- Occupation: worker?
- It's to fool the Krauts. Occupation: student.

223
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,805
Thank you.

224
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,525
Why do you cry? Did they tell you
something in the kitchen again?

225
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,569
You're beautiful so they are
all jealous of you.

226
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,863
What happened?

227
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,657
Stasiek has been shot dead.

228
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,912
Which Stasiek? Who did it?

229
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:42,128
Stasiek Gawlik, my fiancé.
Those damned rascals.

230
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,297
Why would they...?

231
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,382
How should I know?

232
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,135
It's probably just a lie.

233
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,804
Jeziorek has just been here.

234
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,139
The constable?

235
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,267
He mixed everything up or
wanted vodka from you.

236
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:01,856
He said two men from the cement
plant had been shot today.

237
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,485
I knew something was wrong. "Who?" I ask.

238
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:09,113
"Smolarski and Stasiek Gawlik" says He.

239
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,326
I thought I'd drop dead.

240
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,622
"Killed on the spot" he said.

241
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:24,129
They were killed by mistake,
they were after someone else.

242
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:29,301
Have a drink. What's done can't be undone.
Don't cry.

243
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,596
I'll give you a pair of stockings.

244
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,101
Hands off! Can't you wait?
Is that what you've been waiting for?

245
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:38,811
Why not?

246
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,976
Innocent people died meaninglessly after all.

247
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,700
Pricks of conscience...?

248
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,579
You think they're out of place, Major?

249
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,290
Who were they?

250
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,375
Workers of the cement plant.

251
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:31,006
Everything clear.
It was a mistake and it must be corrected.

252
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,674
May I have question?

253
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
Yes?

254
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,764
Is it necessary to kill Szczuka?

255
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,686
As an experienced soldier like you, Lieutenant,

256
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,566
should know I don't have to
answer such questions.

257
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:50,942
I think...

258
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,362
What you think is immaterial.
What's your answer?

259
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:55,864
Yes.

260
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,076
I'm glad we're on the same page.

261
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,328
However, I will answer your question.

262
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,541
I understand your doubts.
I'd be surprised to find you didn't have any.

263
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,751
The situation is very complex and difficult,

264
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:13,673
but years of the war taught us
to deal simply with such problems.

265
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,968
We accept no compromise. Either they or us.

266
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,847
When did you join the underground?

267
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,224
In 1940.

268
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,144
You wanted to fight for the
freedom of Poland, didn't you?

269
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,772
Did you fight for the Poland we have now?

270
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:35,278
You must realize that for you
and for thousands of people like you

271
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,364
there is only one choice: to fight.

272
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,449
Where will you go with your experience?

273
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,702
Every door in this country is closed to you

274
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,288
except the gates of prison.

275
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,206
I know.

276
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,087
As far as the man who caused us
some trouble is concerned.

277
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,476
Szczuka is a member of the intelligentsia,

278
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,813
engineer, communist, brilliant organizer,

279
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,274
who knows exactly what he wants.

280
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,278
After many years abroad he is back from Russia.

281
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,948
Delegated to sit on the
Party Provincial Committee.

282
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,494
You realize what power he has
as the First Secretary.

283
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,001
It'll make quite an impression
if we remove him swiftly.

284
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:37,298
His death will have both political
and propaganda significance,

285
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:42,846
the more important now that
our local situation is quite grave.

286
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:48,227
Tonight Capt. Wilk's unit was surrounded
by the army and Secret Police.

287
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,857
We suffered great losses.
Only a few units managed to retreat.

288
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,904
As far as I know Wilk, he will manage.

289
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,787
Unfortunately, the captain was killed.

290
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,339
The colonel's house is a perfect place to rest

291
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,259
and forget the ugliness of the external world.

292
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,635
I'm glad to hear that, dear Count.

293
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,637
Please, no titles.

294
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,473
Will you, please, sir?

295
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,225
And how's our business?

296
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,726
Quite promising.

297
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,603
Are you sure, my dear?

298
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,856
Sure? Don't you forget the time we live in.

299
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,400
Nothing is sure these days.

300
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:42,280
Away with this pessimism!
Our friends will always be our friends.

301
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,240
Our fate is in your hands.

302
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,076
Rather in my husband's.

303
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,914
He'll do all he can to get us abroad.

304
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:58,921
Let's then drink to the colonel's health
with brandy at the hotel.

305
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,755
Great idea.

306
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,173
Mr. Szczuka has come.

307
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,342
Who?

308
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,469
Mr. Szczuka.

309
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,141
Will you excuse me for a minute?

310
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,394
I have some boring, mundane business to attend.

311
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,604
I sympathize with you, dear.
Business is always boring.

312
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,358
But it is getting harder and harder
to live without it.

313
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:28,701
The attack of the Western powers
will come as fast as lightning...

314
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:33,457
Mrs Staniewicz will be able to visit us
in our estate within a year...

315
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,559
How are you, Katarzyna?

316
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,813
You do recognize me, don't you?

317
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:57,814
I do.

318
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,069
It's been but a month
since I returned to Poland.

319
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,738
I know, I received your letter.

320
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,074
I sent three.

321
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,744
I had nothing more to tell you.

322
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,080
And nothing has changed since.

323
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:26,051
By the end of 1941,
friends informed me of Maria's death.

324
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,762
They told me you took care of Marek.

325
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,516
Should I've sent him to an orphanage?

326
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:37,687
I explicitly wrote that
I didn't want you to bring up my son.

327
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,691
I suggested my friends.
Did you receive the letter?

328
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,529
I did not. No letters whatsoever.

329
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:52,369
Yet even if I had,
Marek would have stayed with us anyway.

330
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,666
You seem to forget that Maria
was my sister after all.

331
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,917
Where is he?

332
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,044
I don't know.

333
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:07,383
I wrote you the last time he was here
was in October, right after the Rising.

334
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,927
You haven't heard from him since?

335
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,928
No.

336
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,057
Is this all you can tell me about my son?

337
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,435
He is 17.

338
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,687
I know.

339
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:24,859
But seventeen-year-olds are grown-up men now.

340
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,779
Who's he now?
What kind of man have you made of him?

341
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,199
A good Pole, I can assure you.

342
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,578
I know your kind of patriotism,

343
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,749
so I can easily imagine
what a man my son is now.

344
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,463
This can't be helped now. But he's 17.

345
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,719
Mark my words. If he's alive,
sooner or later he'll be my son.

346
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,737
No. It was nothing important.

347
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,333
Just a moment. This apartment is not safe.

348
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,216
You're in a hurry?

349
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,717
Not really, I have a date.

350
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,177
- A woman?
- Disappointed?

351
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,804
- Who?
- You.

352
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,225
It's none of my business who you see.

353
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,060
Is it?

354
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,519
I hope so.

355
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,603
And if I don't believe you?

356
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,605
Whatever you say.

357
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,899
So I don't.

358
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,442
Will you be here long?

359
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,568
Till closing time.

360
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,320
You have to? All alone?

361
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,322
Another barmaid comes at 10 pm.

362
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,532
You see?

363
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,994
What should I see? The two of us hardly
manage when it gets crowded.

364
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,997
Here comes your date.

365
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,291
I see you've remembered him well.

366
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,751
A very handsome man.

367
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,753
Sure.

368
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,672
Come.

369
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,130
What's up?

370
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,924
The next room is quiet. Let's go there.

371
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:12,883
What did he say?

372
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,676
Come.

373
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,428
You're mad. This is the quietest place.

374
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,641
Don't you like this table?
It's like dreams come true.

375
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:24,896
You see?

376
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,692
It'll do.

377
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,694
Are you leaving?

378
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,071
Are you crazy?

379
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,906
You were supposed to go to Warsaw.

380
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,493
What happened?
Has the major canceled everything?

381
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,038
Quite the opposite.

382
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,166
Who do you think I am?

383
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,377
You think I would quit a botched job?

384
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:52,047
Guess who is staying at this hotel in room 17,

385
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,634
next door to our common friend?

386
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,346
All right, Maciek.

387
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,075
Who's that moron?

388
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,659
Who?

389
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,328
That one over there.

390
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,335
What a stupid back.

391
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,045
And the face is no better.

392
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,131
Good evening.

393
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,882
The usual - vodka straight and vermouth?

394
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,759
Tonight brandy!

395
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,218
You have something to drink about?

396
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,388
Artistic success.

397
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,058
Thank you.

398
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,851
How's your show?

399
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,687
Superb!

400
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,114
You're most welcome...

401
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,248
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me welcome you to our evening.

402
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,503
Tonight we're celebrating the end of the war.

403
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,213
Who could measure up to this occasion...

404
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:19,928
let's see if the incomparable
Hanka Lewicka can succeed.

405
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,628
Remember?

406
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,713
What?

407
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,507
The spirits at Ginger's.

408
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,426
I don't.

409
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,055
You don't?

410
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,266
When was that?

411
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,477
Oh, but you do.

412
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,313
Stop fooling around.

413
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:57,776
No!

414
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,068
I don't remember.

415
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,922
No!

416
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:22,884
Haneczka,

417
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,011
Wilga,

418
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,805
Kossobudzki,

419
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,057
Ginger,

420
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,269
Kajtek...

421
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,610
We are alive!

422
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,964
Those were the days, Andrzej.

423
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,298
You think so?

424
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,301
The way we lived and in what company...

425
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,221
Were there ever such great guys and girls?

426
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,473
And so what? Almost all were killed.

427
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,269
That's another matter. But life was great.

428
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,228
We were...

429
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,437
Younger.

430
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,648
It's not just that.

431
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,816
We knew what we wanted.

432
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:21,693
Let's say...

433
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,944
We knew what was expected of us.

434
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,739
What a discovery! Sure.

435
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,911
What else could they expect now?

436
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,372
That we should die. Nothing has changed.

437
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,709
What's the problem? We can afford it.

438
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,628
Stop being cynical!

439
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,504
To die is piece of cake.

440
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,631
What do you mean?

441
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,716
We can't do anything else.

442
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,593
Not enough?

443
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,303
Hopelessly little.

444
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,307
You're exaggerating.

445
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,480
You don't have to take it so seriously.

446
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:03,442
We have to get by through all this muddle,

447
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,404
stay calm, keep away from boredom.

448
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,908
What else is there?

449
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,743
Perhaps...

450
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,785
We must have a serious talk.

451
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,092
What a noisy crowd!

452
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,786
How will you handle the man?

453
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,290
Don't worry. I'll manage.

454
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,377
I got the order from the major.

455
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:49,506
And I got it from you. That's the way it is.

456
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,258
And there's this other thing...

457
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,469
I'll carry out the order.

458
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,555
What thing?

459
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,144
Firstly, I was told not take part in this.

460
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,352
Yeah...

461
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,189
I have to beat it and real fast.

462
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,984
Well, this is news.

463
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,485
I'm replacing Wilk.

464
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,988
And what about him?

465
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,906
I'm to replace him.

466
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,996
I see, that's another one...

467
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:38,473
You said there was no one waiting for me.

468
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,017
Will you take me?

469
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,019
You mean it?

470
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,523
Do I mean it?
No one means anything in this country.

471
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,026
But I've got used to it.

472
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,112
If you take me along, I'm going.

473
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,865
When are you off?

474
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,535
Early in the morning. 4:30 am.

475
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,789
You have damned little time to off the man.

476
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:14,217
Let's see. The bloody wake starts about 11 p.m.

477
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,219
It will take some...

478
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,428
Three hours.

479
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,599
That's easy. He'll go back to bed.

480
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,977
See you, Maciek.

481
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,855
Don't mess it up, buddy.

482
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,108
I won't. Bye.

483
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,196
So you've been left alone.

484
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,576
Unfortunately.

485
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,375
Your friend due at 10, isn't she?

486
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:30,710
She is.

487
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,883
So you could disappear at about 10:30?

488
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,554
You will say you have
a headache or something, whatever.

489
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,723
Miss Krysia?

490
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,515
They can wait.

491
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,767
I'd like to pay.

492
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,060
They can wait.

493
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,521
I want to pay!

494
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,859
Will you?

495
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,737
Suppose I do... And what's next?

496
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:00,364
I'm staying at the hotel.

497
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,742
Are you? Nice of you.

498
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,912
First floor, Room 17.

499
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,370
You're sure?

500
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,955
It's easy to check.

501
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,749
I'm so sorry. I check bills only.

502
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,625
Only?

503
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,252
Enough for me. They never tally.

504
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,547
Only checks?

505
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,804
If you check up on me,
you won't make a mistake.

506
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:27,767
So?

507
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,686
So?

508
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,779
These violets are smelling nicer and nicer.

509
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:51,540
Room 17. First floor, 10:30 pm.

510
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,795
I swear I'll be waiting.

511
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,931
Miss!

512
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,323
Sir!

513
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:25,949
What's up?

514
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,742
Your check!

515
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,622
Wait, wait...

516
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,457
Miss!

517
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,710
Just a sec...

518
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,799
Look who's here!

519
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,386
Having a good time?

520
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,973
Excuse me. I'm here in official capacity.

521
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:55,896
The Town Hall is apparently
ill-disposed to the press.

522
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,065
Not to my knowledge.

523
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:04,070
And still I haven't received an invitation.

524
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,116
I am sorry. Mr. Pawlicki has got one.

525
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:15,915
Yeah, but Mr. Pieniąźek does not count anymore?

526
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,837
Excuse me.
It was the mayor himself who drew the list.

527
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:26,009
That's what I mean. My colleague Święcki.

528
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,847
The Mayor.

529
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,352
Why are you staring at me?

530
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:44,944
A thought has just crossed my mind
that could be of interest to you...

531
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,406
Me? I don't think so.

532
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,658
What's up?

533
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:56,165
Just a minor problem...

534
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,835
If my colleague Święcki...

535
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,253
Sir!

536
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:09,095
If you insist...
Should my former colleague go to Warsaw,

537
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:17,310
will he take his current
secretary along or not?

538
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,605
Do you know anything about it?

539
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,860
Pieniąźek knows everything.

540
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,410
Two double vodkas, Miss.

541
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,124
We shall have a drink!

542
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,501
I'm on duty. I can't.

543
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,796
That's fine, then.

544
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,258
You should drink the minister's health then.
It's your duty.

545
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,511
Is that true then?

546
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,390
What ministry?

547
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,724
Of Health.

548
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,688
Not bad. I'd rather it was
the Foreign Affairs department.

549
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:06,901
So would he.
Let's drink to the Foreign Affairs!

550
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,155
Will he take me along?

551
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:15,327
Sure he will. Shit will always surface.

552
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,331
You'll see! In five years..

553
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:26,255
Sure I will. To the 5-year plan!

554
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,820
How are you Mr. Słomka?

555
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,114
I'm always fine, Sir.

556
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,535
Look, gentlemen.
At last a citizen who isn't complaining.

557
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,623
Excuse me, Sir. Naturally,
I already know the editor.

558
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,749
But the other gentleman...

559
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,374
Mr Kalicki.

560
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,877
Exactly, I don't know his position...

561
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:13,843
Oh, I see. Well, if titles mean so much to you,
as of today you can address me as...

562
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,720
What, Sir?

563
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:20,059
Minister, Mr. Słomka.

564
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,646
Watch out, Mr. Słomka.

565
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:34,907
Gentlemen! Excellent, Mr. Słomka.
Where is my secretary?

566
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,866
Has he been here?

567
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:41,288
He has, Sir. Minister, that is.

568
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,166
Mr Drewnowski saw to it all personally

569
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,585
and I must say, he was delighted.

570
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,880
Where's he? He should be here.

571
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:54,885
You want... an appetizer? No?

572
00:50:55,928 --> 00:51:00,890
So tell me what it is that you want.

573
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,226
I want it all!

574
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,771
Piles of money!

575
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,480
So you'll have it.

576
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,527
Sure I will. Enough of misery.

577
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,032
Miss, two more!

578
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,951
Who is it?

579
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,995
It's me.

580
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,025
Were you sure, I'd come?

581
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:34,777
I was.

582
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,529
Do you know why I've come?

583
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:44,119
It's simple. I couldn't fall for you.

584
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,083
Hello?

585
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,293
What?

586
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,798
- You don't want to fall in love?
- With you?

587
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,592
- In general.
- Rather not.

588
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,178
- On principle?
- Why complicate my life?

589
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,683
- It can do it fine by itself.
- Why add more trouble?

590
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,111
Hello!

591
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,321
Yes?

592
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,536
Tell me something about yourself, would you?

593
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,913
What for?

594
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,457
Why not?

595
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,335
I used to live in the country,
my parents had an estate.

596
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,379
- Before the war?
- Yes. Near Poznań.

597
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,216
- And then ...?
- Then we moved to Warsaw.

598
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,344
We?

599
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:47,015
My mother and I.
Father was immediately arrested by the Germans.

600
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:50,143
He died?

601
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:54,606
He did. In Dachau... I guess that's all.

602
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,233
Your mother lives?

603
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,737
She died in the Rising.

604
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,331
And your siblings?

605
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,542
Luckily, I had none.

606
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,252
Luckily?

607
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,795
Fewer losses.

608
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,338
Well, you're right.

609
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,716
You have no family?

610
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,760
None.

611
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,017
Will you stay here long?

612
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,603
I don't know. It seems so.

613
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,771
What will come next?

614
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,064
I don't think about it.

615
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,113
I wasn't that sure you'd come.
You don't know me at all.

616
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,365
Neither do you.

617
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,413
Good... Come.

618
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,250
Have you invited me or not?

619
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,837
Are you a minister's secretary or not?

620
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,759
I have but not on this side.

621
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,303
Both sides are good.

622
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,599
From today on there is only one for me.

623
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,562
Nonsense. You can keep changing sides.

624
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,731
Both sides are always good.

625
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,233
Will you take your secretary along?

626
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,276
Sure.

627
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,154
Good evening, Comrade. This way.

628
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,868
He's a magnificent boy. Working class.
I'll make him a man.

629
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,081
When I become a director...

630
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,082
You surely will!

631
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:36,999
Will I?

632
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,668
You'll be a director.

633
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,544
I will.

634
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,171
Come. You'll be a director!

635
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,640
Good evening.

636
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,393
This way, please. Over there.

637
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,728
Jurgieluszka...

638
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,241
Poland has exploded.

639
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,911
Hooray!

640
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,377
Where are the directors going?

641
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,338
To the banquet!

642
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:34,850
I'll lead you to a glorious
vision of the future!

643
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,822
What is this? Where have you been?

644
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,491
What is this scum doing here?

645
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:56,454
It just happened this way...

646
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,248
Minister, that is...

647
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,541
I thought the press, Sir...

648
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,211
What nonsense is this? What has come over you?

649
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,504
Everything in order.

650
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:15,474
Congratulations, minister.
On behalf of the democratic press...

651
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:22,856
This is a scandal!

652
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,909
What a happy day! All the best!

653
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,828
Thank you, Comrade Major.

654
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,292
This is Comrade Wrona,
the Head of the Chief Security Bureau.

655
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,878
I can't look you in the eye
after what happened.

656
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,380
It is not the way I thought
it would be in the forest.

657
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,216
We're not in the forest any longer.

658
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,802
Welcome, Comrade. This way, please.

659
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:00,768
So you won't go?

660
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:03,855
I won't! Is this a democracy or not?

661
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,566
Comrades, please be seated.

662
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,614
You won't? Just you wait...

663
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,158
Are you threatening?

664
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:19,620
Me? And who kowtowed to the old regime?

665
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,705
Shut up, you scum!

666
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:21,914
Didn't you?

667
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,124
Shut up!

668
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,085
Didn't you kowtow to the old regime?

669
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:27,003
And what about you?

670
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:27,671
I did.

671
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,528
Poland has exploded on us.

672
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,904
Director!

673
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:54,990
You will be one.

674
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:56,907
There is too few of us still.

675
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,451
You must win them over.

676
00:58:58,452 --> 00:58:59,410
Who?

677
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:00,912
The people!

678
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,041
So you've already drunk some.

679
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,627
Sure I have.

680
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,215
So will you too.

681
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,802
Hush. Hush.

682
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,014
I don't like this kind of fuss.
It's good for the bourgeois.

683
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,389
You don't like it?

684
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,308
I don't.

685
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:27,105
You surely will.

686
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,237
Silence!

687
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,034
Minister Święcki.

688
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:46,708
Comrades and citizens.

689
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,840
Today, May the 8th,

690
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,345
is a great achievement of the reborn Poland...

691
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,397
So how are you doing, Mrs. Jurgieluszka?

692
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,567
Speeches now.

693
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,737
The Minister himself.

694
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,824
Has anybody puked yet?

695
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:24,496
No, too early. Everything in its time.

696
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,793
Now the speeches.
Then the people will start running here.

697
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,002
This is going to be your night.

698
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,797
I think so too.

699
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,887
It must be his birthday.

700
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:46,267
It isn't anybody's birthday.

701
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:47,644
An anniversary, then...

702
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,315
What're you babbling about? It's about Poland!

703
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,907
You know what?

704
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,370
We've known each other
for a couple of hours only,

705
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,332
but it seems ages.

706
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,211
Tell me.

707
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,129
What?

708
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,674
What kind of man you really are?

709
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,178
What do you mean?

710
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,555
You seem different now.

711
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:27,183
Is it bad?

712
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:30,770
It doesn't matter, I guess.

713
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,984
Not at all?

714
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,198
Are you cold?

715
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,658
A little.

716
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,163
Good now?

717
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,249
Better anyway.

718
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,930
Why do you wear shades?

719
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:11,019
A souvenir of my unrequited love for homeland.

720
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:21,363
During the Rising I walked
too much in the sewers.

721
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,704
No, no.

722
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,039
Why not?

723
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,583
I don't want it. It's pointless.

724
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,043
Why?

725
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,172
Don't you get it? You're leaving.

726
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,302
I don't want any partings, any memories,

727
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,722
nothing one can leave behind.

728
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,564
Not even nice memories?

729
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,943
Not if they're meant to be only memories.

730
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:04,698
You have your life, I have mine.

731
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:09,244
We just met, it's nice.

732
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,913
What else do we need?

733
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,375
What's up?

734
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:23,465
It's nothing. Our neighbor's back.

735
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,885
You can hear everything here.

736
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,680
Everything.

737
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,185
Hug me.

738
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,391
Have you got cigarettes?

739
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,770
Sure I do. American or Hungarian?

740
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,439
Hungarian will do.

741
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,576
Here you are.

742
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,162
Thank you.

743
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,546
What about tomorrow?

744
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,966
It is tomorrow already.

745
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,969
Shall we spend the day together?

746
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,972
Well, you know...

747
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,795
Where were you taken?

748
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:25,963
In Międzyborze forest.

749
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,131
Captured with Wilk's gang?

750
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,758
Captain Wilk's unit.

751
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,300
What's your name?

752
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,176
Krzysztof.

753
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:31,928
That's all?

754
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,388
Krzysztof Zawadzki.

755
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,348
And your name?

756
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,062
Turn around!

757
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,481
How old are you?

758
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,483
A hundred.

759
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,112
How old?

760
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,823
A hundred and one.

761
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,520
You have to go?

762
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,565
I should or else Lili kills me.

763
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,192
Bye.

764
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:41,956
Could you give me a light?

765
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,918
Light? Sure.

766
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,344
Thank you.

767
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,037
What happened?

768
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:26,793
It's nothing. Stay with me for half an hour.

769
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,253
OK?

770
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:29,754
Sure.

771
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,736
It's beginning to rain.

772
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:02,453
Here. Hush, hush. Let's go.

773
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,252
A penny for your thoughts.

774
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,169
You won't tell me?

775
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,132
It's just...

776
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,176
I've been thinking about what I shouldn't have.

777
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,013
All right. No more thinking.

778
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,765
Spare me the reproachful look.

779
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,226
It's not reproachful.

780
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:26,935
But...?

781
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,730
Don't you know yet?

782
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,482
It's going to pour.

783
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,692
You want to go back?

784
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:34,527
No.

785
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,616
Oh God, how beautiful life can be!

786
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,909
Knock on wood!

787
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,827
It was just a wish.

788
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,079
Touch wood.

789
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:58,676
Life is dangerous.

790
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,555
Let's hide over there!

791
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,476
No, here!

792
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,197
Aren't you cold?

793
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,499
Look! What an old tombstone.

794
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,632
An inscription.

795
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:48,518
"You are as a torch blazing with flames,

796
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:55,900
burning rags fall about you flaming,

797
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:08,371
and you do not know if the fire marks
freedom or the final loss.

798
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:17,672
Will all that you cherish be lost in ashes"

799
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,273
The letters are unclear. I can't see any more.

800
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,280
That's Norwid:

801
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,751
"Will there be among the ashes

802
01:10:56,169 --> 01:11:00,214
a sparkling diamond,

803
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,469
the dawn of everlasting victory?"

804
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:11,017
That's nice...
Will there be a sparkling diamond...

805
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,232
And what are we?

806
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,615
You? A diamond for sure.

807
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:35,750
Listen! I must tell you something.

808
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,084
Anything sad?

809
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:38,878
No.

810
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,214
Well, I don't know.

811
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,883
I just don't know.

812
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:05,070
I'd like to change some things.

813
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,614
Rearrange my life.

814
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,576
It's not easy to talk about it all.

815
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,204
No need. I can guess a lot.

816
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,580
You do?

817
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,208
Is it so hard?

818
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:27,134
You know, I haven't given
many things a thought until now.

819
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,179
Things just worked out by themselves.

820
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,057
The point was to survive.

821
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,768
Do you follow?

822
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,145
I do.

823
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,401
I'd like to have a normal life, to study.

824
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,113
I have a high school diploma.
Maybe I could enter the Technical Academy.

825
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,199
And you?

826
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,994
You promised not to say anything sad.

827
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,499
This is sad? Should I knock on wood again?

828
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:04,547
My God, had I known
yesterday what I know now...

829
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,093
I wouldn't have come to you then.

830
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:19,896
I haven't known what love is. I really haven't.

831
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,149
My heel!

832
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:24,650
Where?

833
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,907
Don't worry. I have repaired bigger things.

834
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:08,569
What's this? Are you in a circus?!
What's going on?

835
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,613
Hush.

836
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:18,996
The lady had a minor disaster.
Should I look for a cobbler at night?

837
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,415
Shame on you. On you too, Miss.

838
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,335
The young these days!

839
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,547
You can't even respect the dead.

840
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,298
What?

841
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,508
Can't you see?

842
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:36,222
You think it's funny.
There are two murdered people here.

843
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,351
Maciek, what are you doing?

844
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:54,824
Come in.

845
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,483
Where was that?

846
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:30,901
You don't remember?

847
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:38,908
I was so totally drunk.
This wine is so treacherous.

848
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:39,785
It is.

849
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:45,791
"Alwaseta", the early days, the Spanish...

850
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:51,714
Grabowski was killed in the forest,
Kubacki, in France in 1944.

851
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:56,969
Do you recall? There were 36 of us at first.
Who's left alive?

852
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,014
Those were the days.

853
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,308
There'll be good times now as well.

854
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:11,734
I feel lost in all this.
I'd introduce order here very fast.

855
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:16,697
The lot down there is not the whole Poland.

856
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:22,286
I know. But that's not very comforting.

857
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,670
I don't know how to govern.

858
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:39,053
Don't learn it, Franek.
Believe me, don't learn it.

859
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:44,100
There is so much suffering,
tears and wrongs here.

860
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:54,401
Everyone here carries his baggage...
Learn to understand it.

861
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,278
What's there to understand?

862
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,327
German.

863
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,412
Have you found them?

864
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,374
We haven't, but we will.

865
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,584
There are some English as well.

866
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:16,173
At close range, it makes no difference.

867
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:23,848
It's time to bed.

868
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:28,393
Tomorrow we start to work.

869
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,771
It's going to be a nice day. The rain's over.

870
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:36,068
Till tomorrow. Salut.

871
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,468
When are you leaving?

872
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:04,763
Tomorrow, I guess.

873
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,560
But maybe I could still change it all.

874
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,021
What?

875
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,734
Various things.

876
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,612
You could?

877
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,780
Perhaps...

878
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,197
Buying yourself flowers?

879
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,741
We need to talk in earnest.

880
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,495
I thought we already did.

881
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,756
So?

882
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:06,134
You know, I'm not a coward.

883
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,219
So what?

884
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:14,393
You see, I can't go on killing...
hiding any more.

885
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,853
I just want to live.

886
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:19,188
Nothing else. You must understand me.

887
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,649
I don't have to do anything.

888
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,402
Are saying this as a soldier or as a friend?

889
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:24,944
I don't get it.

890
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:26,613
You don't want to, I'd say.

891
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,326
In this case I can only speak
as your superior officer.

892
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,203
You volunteered to do it.

893
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:34,704
You're my only friend.

894
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:38,333
Leave this sentimental crap.
You've fallen in love.

895
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,837
That's your business.
But If your things come first,

896
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,006
then it's called...

897
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,592
I've never been a deserter..

898
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:50,471
What about now? You volunteered.

899
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:58,561
People change. I'm not running away.

900
01:20:58,562 --> 01:20:59,772
But you'd like to.

901
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:04,026
You want me to say - OK, you're in love.
Do as you please.

902
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:07,029
How many times have we fought together?

903
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,115
What if you fell in love then?
Would you come to me then?

904
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,659
What about the Rising?

905
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:14,744
It was different.

906
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,037
It wasn't.

907
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,375
You keep forgetting you were and are one of us.

908
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:20,959
It counts, doesn't it?

909
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,120
You did it now.
You can kiss your career good bye.

910
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,328
Out with you.

911
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,124
You'll sing a different tune tomorrow
when the Minister gets you.

912
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:56,305
When he gets me. No matter.
Life's but a house of cards.

913
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:58,140
Have a drink, sir.

914
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,968
No. I'll do it myself.

915
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:37,095
Just like that?

916
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,306
Have no fear. Now I care about my life.

917
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:43,644
I'll be waiting for you at 4:30 am. Remember!

918
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,062
No.

919
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:49,816
So we must go separate ways.

920
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,528
I don't think we will ever meet again.

921
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,907
Only one of us may be proven right.

922
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:58,867
Bye.

923
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,161
Andrzej!

924
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,414
Tell me, do you believe in all this?

925
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,543
Do I? It's immaterial.

926
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:24,517
Will you buy violets, sir?

927
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,520
ZoŚka, let's go home.

928
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,581
Everything's in order.

929
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:51,587
Come in!

930
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:59,260
Excuse me, Comrade, but it's important.
Major Wrona sends me.

931
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:00,596
Do come in.

932
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:06,101
Do you have a son?

933
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:07,811
Marek, 17 years old.

934
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,645
That's too bad.

935
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:10,730
What happened?

936
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,525
He was with Wilk's gang.

937
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:18,696
Wait. We'll send a car.
The porter will tell you it arrives.

938
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,908
Good. I'll wait. Thank you, Lieutenant.

939
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,210
Do you know Wilk's name?

940
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,132
No.

941
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,760
What did you do in the Rising?

942
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:43,305
I shot... at Germans.

943
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,848
And now at Poles.

944
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,436
And you at sparrows.

945
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:06,703
Porter!

946
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:11,750
Our car comes any minute.
Tell Comrade Szczuka when it arrives.

947
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,170
Szczuka? Room 18? I will.

948
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:39,439
And here it is! Let's drink to our Warsaw!

949
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,612
It's a beautiful night.
I will take a walk before I depart.

950
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,615
Are you leaving already?

951
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,034
What can I do? My wife's jealous.

952
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,643
Stop it! I can't take it any more!

953
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:14,696
It's time to go home, gentlemen!

954
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,239
Just a moment, gentlemen.

955
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,125
Are you artists or not?

956
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:12,212
At this hour? Sir...

957
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:16,548
An artist shouldn't care about the time of day!

958
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,802
I demand absolute obedience!

959
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:23,014
It won't work.

960
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:25,100
We've never played it.

961
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,559
I will not accept any excuses.

962
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,562
Young man, please. A-Major!

963
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:40,824
Ladies and gentlemen! The last dance. A-Major!

964
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:15,775
What happened?

965
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:18,527
Nothing. I must go.

966
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:19,821
Right now?

967
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,240
My train departs at 4:30.

968
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,243
So you couldn't change it all.

969
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:26,452
I couldn't.

970
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,458
Not a word more. No more excuses.

971
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:40,341
Don't say a word. Go!

972
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,898
Superb!

973
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,400
And now a big discovery.

974
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,072
Welcome of the dawn!

975
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:08,410
An idea of genius.

976
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:10,622
Ladies and gentlemen, let's have the Polonaise!

977
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:27,138
I proclaim general concord!

978
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,535
Aren't they having fun...

979
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:54,749
If it could be in our Warsaw not in ruins...

980
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:03,590
As long as I'm here,
you'll always get a good room.

981
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:04,842
Thanks. Goodbye.

982
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:16,396
Hey! Give my love to Ujazdowskie Avenue.

983
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,137
Hi.

984
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,683
Come here.

985
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,896
Give it back.

986
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,524
You changed your mind.

987
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:03,442
Why?

988
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:06,029
You don't know?

989
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:09,948
Now you want to be a hero.

990
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:12,452
You've come only because your career ended!

991
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:32,555
Maciek!

992
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:42,815
Maciek, wait!

993
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,577
Are you crazy?

994
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:56,913
He's armed.

995
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:00,708
Halt or I'll shoot!

996
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:14,805
Watch out. He's armed!

997
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:15,597
Where is he?

998
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:16,474
Come!

999
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:19,268
Come on!

1000
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:46,503
He couldn't go far.

1001
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,046
I saw him.

1002
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,424
There he is!

1003
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:15,087

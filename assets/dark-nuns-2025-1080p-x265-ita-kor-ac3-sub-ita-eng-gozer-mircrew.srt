(Latin) Speak!

3

(Latin) Speak! Why have you come here?!

4
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,131
(Latin) You summoned me!

5
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,964

and the curses of the devil!

Father!

10
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,631
How dare you show up here?

11
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,881
You brash little bitch!

12
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,964
Let's wash you up first.

13
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,256
Is all that holy water?

14
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:24,214
A wretch who hasn't even been ordained!

15
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,589
Mom's spank hurts the most, doesn't it?

16
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:28,547
You damned mass of cursed energy!

17
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,756
That won't come out.

18
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,339
Not until the exorcism is over.

19
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,297

20
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,006
You vile filth!

21
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:42,506
Ring it, and resume the prayer.

22
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,172
Who performs an exorcism so incompetently?!

23
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:52,297

00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:24,714
He doesn't seem like
a patient like that at all.

74
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,839
Thank you for graciously sharing the room.

75
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,797
We'll move him to a private room
as soon as one is available.

76
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,922
There's no need.

77
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:36,381

A physician who denies possession...

81
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:05,964
Michela, what do you think?

82
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:10,381
Does possession really not exist?

83
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:18,714
There's a saying: the existence
of evil proves the existence of good.

84
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,631
It's the result of a combination

85
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:23,881
of dissociative disorders
and borderline personality disorder.

86
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:27,964
With a supportive environment, regular therapy,

87
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:31,756
and medication,
it's a condition that can fully recover.

88
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:40,714
We already have enough similar clinical cases.

89
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:42,256
Wow.

90
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,714
You really are Father Paolo's protégé.

91
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:47,131
Alright, very well.

92
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,422
Is she human?

93
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:54,006
She spoke like an Al.

94
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:55,506
She felt so cold.

95
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:59,006
You've even performed a Buddhist rite?

96
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:05,214
I've heard of a renowned monk in Busan...

97
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,464
I just thought we should try everything...

98
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:16,089
Mrs. Choi.

99
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,214
A series of events beyond human understanding

100
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,464
can occur at times.

101
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:26,756
If you flip a coin ten times
and it comes up heads every time?

102
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,297
It'd be an astonishing coincidence.

103
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:33,172
But imagine that instead of coin flips,

104
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:38,256
unfortunate events
are happening to our loved ones.

105
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:45,172
Weak humans seek answers
in the occult, superstition,

106
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:50,881
or in the baseless doctrines of charlatans.

107
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,339
God tests us in these ways.

108
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,047
Your faith in Him.

psychiatric counseling
and proper medication-that's all.

112
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:13,714
But Father Andrea said...

113
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:16,297
and the nun from Liberation Order...

114
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,839
A nun?

115
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:23,131
An unordained nun
performed an exorcism on the child?

116
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:25,172
We must hurry.

117
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:28,089
Father Kim in Rome must be contacted.

118
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:31,589
If not him, at least Father Choi.

119
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,881
Personally, I'm not entirely against exorcisms,

120
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:43,381
but everything has its procedures.

121
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:44,881
A nun, though...

122
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:48,964
Father Andrea called to request my help.

123
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,756
And you personally
approved the exorcism that day.

124
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:55,631
I'm not denying it, but...

125
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,214
the situation right now...

126
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:02,339
Even the Seoul Archdiocese
is expressing disapproval.

127
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:04,589
You're infuriating.

128
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:05,672
Easy!

129
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,339
Sister Giunia!

130
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:13,381
Why don't you wait at the convent for now?

131
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:18,381
If you keep dodging like this,
you won't be able to handle it later.

132
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,881
Sister Giunia.

133
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:28,297
Ignoring a confirmed possession
is also a form of murder.

134
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:38,297
Father Kim taught her his way.

135
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,672
But they say her prayers are pretty effective.

136
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,381
She's still just a nun...

137
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,589
What will you do back in your hometown?

138
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:51,422
I'll teach some English to the folks there.

139
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,881
These are Hee-joon's.

140
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,464
He attempted suicide?

141
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:09,422
He probably thought
everything would end if he died.

142
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:18,422
How could the boy know
that dying doesn't get rid of the devil?

143
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:22,464
The chief spirit inside that child...

144
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,672
it's not just some
minor ghost or wandering soul.

145
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:30,547
Did the boy draw these?

146
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:32,131
Yes.

147
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:41,047
There was just one other case
very similar to this child.

148
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,214
You know, the unofficial one.

149
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,714
All the records were destroyed.

150
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:49,422
Devils that deny God and commit heinous

151
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:52,881
acts using human bodies,

152
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:58,839
that one is definitely
of the 12 Manifestations.

153
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:45,172
You haven't been
getting regular checkups, have you?

154
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,922
Just tell me.

155
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,256
Haven't you...

156
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:53,506
noticed anything unusual with your uterus?

157
00:13:55,422 --> 00:13:59,256
The cancer is rapidly
spreading to surrounding areas.

158
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,172
Doctor.

159
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,672
Yes, Sister.

160
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,422
Am I dying?

161
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:14,131
Sister!

162
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,214
Your next appointment--

163
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:19,714
I need to meet with Father Paolo.

164
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:24,339
Exorcism is a cultural practice
shaped by the needs of its era.

165
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,422
It has been long since degenerated.

166
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:32,631
Those who believe they
possess spiritual powers and can confront evil

167
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,714
call themselves "Light Workers."

168
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:41,422
I heard about your nickname too:

169
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,214
"Dark Nun."

170
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:50,672
I'd like to discuss possession,
not get a lecture, Father.

171
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,422
Mystics who believe they're special
often possess egos far stronger than average.

172
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,922
That intense ego, bordering on obsession,

173
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:04,381
can sometimes create
illusions that people think are miracles.

174
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:11,047
I'm not well-educated, so this is hard for me.

175
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:16,381
Hee-joon created these illusions
in response to bullying and ostracism.

176
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,339
Possession isn't real.

177
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:29,839
- Yes, ma'am...
<i>- Hello?</i>

178
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:31,672
<i>Mrs. Choi?</i>

179
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:35,589
Call it a devil or an illusion,
whatever you want,

180
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:38,006
what matters is saving the child.

181
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,006
He's in tremendous pain.

182
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:45,339
Rituals won't save him,
only medical treatment will.

183
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:49,631
Without extensive medical records,
getting exorcism approval is impossible.

184
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:51,922
He's had all possible psychiatric treatment.

185
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:57,172
It is unfortunate that he came to me so late,
but my treatment starts now.

186
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,214
Delays could put him in more danger.

187
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:02,381
A rushed exorcism could endanger the child too.

188
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,922
That's already happened, hasn't it?

189
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,381
<i>- Do you even know what day it is today?</i>
- Yes, ma'am...

190
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:10,339
<i>- Will you ever pay me back?</i>
- Of course!

191
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:13,922
<i>If you keep this up,
we can settle this legally!</i>

192
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,464
Please, just give me
until the end of this month.

193
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,714
I'm working to get another loan...

194
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:22,881
<i>Same old story! Are you sure this time?</i>

195
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:24,922
Yes, yes, of course, ma'am.

196
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:28,797
<i>Fucking ignorant bitch!</i>

197
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:31,547
<i>You killed off your hubby,
it's a matter of time for your son.</i>

198
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:32,881
Sister.

199
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:35,631
There are lines that should not be crossed.

200
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,422
Have you heard of the 12 Manifestations?

201
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,256
Sister Giunia!

202
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:45,297
<i>Either whore yourself,
or sell your organs, bitch!</i>

203
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,006
<i>I took pity on you because of your crazy son!</i>

204
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:52,672
You and Hee-joon are fundamentally the same.

205
00:16:53,006 --> 00:16:55,297
God is with neither of you.

206
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,714
He exists solely in heaven.

207
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:22,131
Let me make it official
once again, Sister Giunia.

208
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:27,422
So long as he's under my care,
exorcism will not be approved easily.

209
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:33,547
You should start by learning respect
for the church and its teachings.

210
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:37,422
Sister Michela!

211
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:39,631
I'm sorry, Father.

212
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:42,422
Patient Choi Hee-joon has...

213
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,506
...jumped off the roof.

214
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,922
And the boy?

215
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,464
He's been sedated.

216
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:16,172
He may be at risk
of self-harm when he wakes up,

217
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:18,922
ensure the staff takes shifts monitoring him.

218
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,506
Yes, Father.

219
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:53,006
You impure spirit, in the name
of Lord Jesus Christ, I command you:

220
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:56,047
depart from here at once.

221
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:59,506
And never return again.

222
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,131
You shall no longer trouble us.

223
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:09,881
You have no place
in this sinner's body, depart now.

224
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,214
Let's go together.

225
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:46,339
Sorry?

226
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:49,797
I'll drive you to Mrs. Choi's funeral.

227
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,381
I have a hearing impairment.

228
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,381
It's congenital, but only in my right ear.

229
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:20,631
Without an earphone,
it's hard to enjoy phone calls or music.

230
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:26,922
But when it comes to evil spirits,
I can hear even their whispers.

231
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:32,422
Some claim to see spirits,
feel chills or warmth,

232
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,964
or sense them intuitively.

233
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:41,047
They call that having "spiritual sight."

234
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:45,089
What do you mean...

235
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:52,881
What about you? Do you see or hear spirits?

236
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,881
I know you're one of us.

237
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:03,714
You're spiritually gifted.

238
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:10,464
Those who reject the path
of shamanism decide to become nuns instead.

239
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:14,297
Did a shaman tell you that working
in a hospital could make up for it?

240
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,089
You're being very rude!

241
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:21,089
Before the funeral ends,
the exorcism must be performed.

242
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:25,672
The mother's death
can distract Father Paolo for a while.

243
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:29,089
Why are you so invested in this?

244
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:33,464
Because he'll die if we leave him alone.

245
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,839
I can't do it alone.

246
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,922
You're Father Paolo's protégé.

247
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:48,714
What exactly do you want me to do?

248
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:52,672
At least with you, he won't be suspicious.

249
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:03,756
Father Paolo always said...

250
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,381
that the possession doesn't exist.

251
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:11,964
Moron.

252
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,672
What?

253
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,422
Did I ask you to perform the exorcism?

254
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,547
Just help me smuggle the boy out.

255
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,256
Go over this and think about it.

256
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,381
Shit...

257
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:46,089
Who does she think she is?

258
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:50,964
<i>Demon!</i>

259
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:52,964
<i>Say your name!</i>

260
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,339
<i>I am...</i>

261
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,839
<i>your stepfather, your mother's enemy,</i>

262
00:22:58,006 --> 00:23:01,672
<i>the root of your faith, despicable fool!</i>

263
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,339
<i>Do not be swayed by the demon's tongue!</i>

264
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:08,797
<i>Marco, snap out of it!</i>

265
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,297
(Psychoanalysis and Treatment of Possession)

266
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:01,964
The Hanged Man.

267
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:07,339
Don't you think
he could free himself and escape?

268
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:13,381
Su-young, you can break free too.

269
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:18,756
You like drawings, don't you?

270
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,297
Keep them.

271
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:23,214
But don't let the nuns catch you.

272
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,464
Especially not Father Paolo.

273
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:35,047
Who is it?

274
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:12,714
Do you know what people call kids like us?

275
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,381
"Cursed."

276
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:21,381
A cursed child born of a human and a demon.

277
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,756
Who is it?

278
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,256
Had a nightmare?
What could this crying sound be?

279
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:46,547
A goat for you too?

280
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:49,547
Must be.

281
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:51,839
Did you think it over?

282
00:26:56,922 --> 00:27:00,422
Why won't you tell me where we're going?

283
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:04,589
To Juan in Incheon.

284
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,339
Hyo-won Altar.

285
00:27:07,422 --> 00:27:08,339
What?

286
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:13,172
Hyo-won used to be
a nun in the same Order as me,

287
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:15,547
she's a highly skilled

288
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,422
and experienced shaman.

289
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,172
A shaman?

290
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,506
Are you insane?

291
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:29,964
To most people, you, me,
and shamans are all lunatics.

292
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:32,922
You're unbelievable.

293
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:36,047
Is there anything a nun like you wouldn't do?

294
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:39,047
If it helps with the exorcism.

295
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,589
W-w-which name is the reservation under?

296
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,756
The nun tunic doesn't suit this place.

297
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,964
There are plenty of eyes here.

298
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:05,256
Was she really a nun before?

299
00:28:09,797 --> 00:28:11,922
Did you take in a child of the spirit?

300
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,672
He's a temple orphan, his mom was a shaman,

301
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:18,631
so I took him in, but he's spiritually dull.

302
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:23,756
He's not mute, but stutters badly.

303
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,672
His fortune-telling isn't great either.

304
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:30,922
What about that girl over there?

305
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:35,464
She's struggling with her identity.

306
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,547
Let's have a smoke first.

307
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,339
Cake.

308
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:04,089
H-h-his n-n-name.

309
00:29:11,756 --> 00:29:14,464
(Rice Cake)

310
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:25,714
Birth chart confirms it,

311
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:30,422
I see a hint of a snake,

312
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:34,256
but also a dragon prince
from the Underwater Palace.

313
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:36,506
A fallen spirit...

314
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,672
I think you're right, a demon.

315
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,714
Even if we exorcise it successfully,

316
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:49,964
his family's guardian spirits
will end up inhabiting him instead.

317
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:51,589
There's no other way.

318
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:55,797
He's bound to be a shaman,
just like the Cursed.

319
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,881
"Cursed"?

320
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,839
A child conceived
during the mother's possession.

321
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:03,214
He's bound to be a shaman.

322
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,756
That might be better than dying...

323
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:13,464
He wasn't born to be a shaman,
but forced to become one.

324
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:23,297
Who are you to judge
and decide things so freely?

325
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:26,631
You're right.

326
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,756
We acted too hastily.

327
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:36,756
If one came from water,
we'll handle it with water.

328
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:41,089
Should we contact Master Dam-eon?
We're running out of time.

329
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:47,714
The brat has quite a pretty face.

330
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:52,381
Dress him in ceremonial robes
and he'll shine in the ritual.

331
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:09,672
<i>Away, away, evil energy!</i>

332
00:31:11,756 --> 00:31:13,922
<i>Suri, suri, masuri!</i>

333
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:33,547
Sung-ae.

334
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:37,297
Why?

335
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:44,172
Do nuns get free health checkups too?

336
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:49,297
Why? Do you see the Grim Reaper near me?

337
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:54,047
Go get one, you idiot.

338
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,256
I took you for a greedy shaman,
but you've still got the gift.

339
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,464
It's been fading for a while now.

340
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:18,589
<i>I bow in reverence
to the complete and exalted one.</i>

341
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:23,381
May the sacredness
be illuminated and fulfilled.

342
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:37,422
Let's start the ritual!

343
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:43,881
Will you save this child kneeling before you?

344
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,714
Yes, don't worry.

345
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:49,547
My poor, sick child,

346
00:32:49,672 --> 00:32:51,839
I'll soothe your restless ancestors and banish

347
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:58,214
the spirits that invaded you,
so you can live in peace!

348
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:31,839
Onward!

349
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:35,881
<i>The waters of the East and West Seas,
the South and North Seas!</i>

350
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:38,506
<i>Are you the Dragon King of the Four Seas?</i>

351
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:40,506
<i>The Seven Stars
Dragon King reigns in the air!</i>

352
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,964
Stop it already... stop!

353
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,381
<i>The Mountain God and Dragon King!</i>

354
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:44,797
It's hurts, Sister!

355
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:47,089
<i>Flowing Dragon King, Rising Dragon King,</i>

356
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,672
<i>- On the black earth, where are the people,</i>
- My Lord, my God.

357
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:52,631
<i>my people are no longer mine.</i>

358
00:33:52,714 --> 00:33:58,089
<i>Today, I will clear the fog
in this child's mind,</i>

359
00:33:58,172 --> 00:34:03,256
<i>and bring him peace and clarity!</i>

360
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:39,839
You stupid nun!

361
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:42,589
Do you think you can cast us out?

362
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,297
No! Hee-joon!

363
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:19,256
He'll just sleep for the time being.

364
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:21,881
But not for long.

365
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:25,881
Leave him to Father Paolo.

366
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:31,797
If he stays in the hospital,
others will be in danger.

367
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,589
Playing hero, are you?

368
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,297
What's your justification
for being so fixated on exorcism?

369
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:49,714
Do you need justification to save lives?

370
00:35:55,422 --> 00:36:00,131
As you know, I can't help anymore.

371
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,797
I'm truly disappointed in you.

372
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:12,339
Where exactly did you take Hee-joon?

373
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,422
I thought he should at least
see his mother's last moments.

374
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:19,047
Are you a funeral director?

375
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:21,381
I'm sorry, Father.

376
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,297
We're clergy, yes.

377
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:28,506
But you and I are also medical professionals!

378
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:34,756
Don't tell me you met that nun.

379
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:40,047
It's practically a cult founded by Father Kim.

380
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:45,672
I know you drew these back in the day too.

381
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,006
Be honest with me.

382
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:54,672
Do you think Hee-joon is like you?

383
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:14,839
Are you...

384
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:19,797
seeing visions again?

385
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:24,672
Of course not.

386
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:29,089
Michela.

387
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:33,214
Hee-joon can be saved.

388
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,422
I'll do it, no matter what.

389
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,797
Yes, Father.

390
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:43,131
You're the proof of it.

391
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:57,464
Sister Michela.

392
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:05,464
I'm going to Chungju to be with my son.

393
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:09,089
Is that right?

394
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:11,256
Thank you for everything.

395
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,756
Park Myung-ja...

396
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:29,214
Park Myung-ja...

397
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:42,964
Patient Park Myung-ja,
time of death, 10:15 a.m.

398
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:10,131
<i>The midday temperature reaches 42°C.</i>

399
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:12,547
<i>Enduring the heat and ash</i>

400
00:39:12,547 --> 00:39:15,422
<i>is no easy task for the bats.</i>

401
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:25,006
<i>Some find sanctuary
under the inner leaves of palm trees,</i>

402
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:31,256
<i>but others must search for shade elsewhere.</i>

403
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:34,047
<i>This sometimes causes fights.</i>

404
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:46,381
<i>Exhausted by thirst and territorial disputes,</i>

405
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,589
<i>the bats can move to nearby areas
where water remains abundant.</i>

406
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:46,714
H-help... Help me...

407
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:52,672
Father Paolo...
he took Hee-joon to the cloistered monastery...

408
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,464
Monastery?

409
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:59,214
He wanted to try
treating him with the monks there.

410
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:04,714
The situation there must be bad.

411
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,089
Is that where you're from?

412
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:13,089
Over 15 years ago.

413
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:16,131
It was a prayer center back then.

414
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,672
Father Paolo!

415
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:30,422
Michela...

416
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:32,339
Where is the child?

417
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:42,214
Possession doesn't exist,
but you've barricaded this door tightly.

418
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,839
You came back with two masses of cursed energy?

419
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,881
Did you think I'd be your guinea pig like her?

420
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:27,631
You thought a bigger cross
would solve everything?

421
00:44:29,714 --> 00:44:32,839
Did you meet your friend on the way here?

422
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:41,422
You cunning fool!

423
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,672
She says hello.

424
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:47,881
She asked me how you two are doing.

425
00:44:50,506 --> 00:44:52,214
Michela.

426
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:55,422
Hee-joon can be saved.

427
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:58,547
I'll do it, no matter what.

428
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:02,756
You're the proof of it.

429
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:13,172
You have glorified your honor
by my non-existence.

430
00:45:13,506 --> 00:45:18,131
Soon, you'll lose that
petty name of yours that you fear most.

431
00:45:19,214 --> 00:45:22,922
And your nephew
will die fleeing from the military,

432
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:26,631
shot by mistake, his head blown apart.

433
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:30,089
Your beloved sister
will hang herself the next day!

434
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:32,172
Like that bitch.

435
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:37,922
And you'll go mad, just like your mother did!

436
00:45:39,422 --> 00:45:40,547
Father Paolo!

437
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:41,672
Father!

438
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:44,006
Please, get a grip!

439
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:45,589
Father Paolo!

440
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:50,172
Father Paolo!

441
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:52,006
Father Paolo!

442
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:53,089
Father Paolo!

443
00:45:53,172 --> 00:45:54,881
Father, snap out of it!

444
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,297
Father...

445
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,047
Father, please!

446
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:04,631
Father!

447
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,214
With even one drop of Christ's blood,

448
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:13,006
we believe the whole world can be saved.

449
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:40,547
Is this child's body so precious?

450
00:46:43,922 --> 00:46:45,631
Sister Giunia!

451
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:49,506
You despicable bastard!
Exploiting the child's body--

452
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:50,672
It's okay, it's okay.

453
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:54,631
Sister...

454
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:59,172
Kill me...

455
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:02,131
Please, kill me...

456
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,506
Don't give up, Hee-joon.

457
00:48:07,714 --> 00:48:09,172
Let's not give up.

458
00:48:10,047 --> 00:48:15,131
No... I can't do this anymore.

459
00:48:16,797 --> 00:48:19,256
I just want to go to my mom.

460
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,756
No, I'm not giving up on you.

461
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,422
We can do this together.

462
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:35,589
Just hang on a little longer, please, Hee-joon.

463
00:48:38,006 --> 00:48:40,006
I want to live.

464
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:45,506
I want to live...

465
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,047
Is this a non-smoking area?

466
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:48,297
Maybe this worked like
a talisman and saved his life.

467
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:02,672
Why do you fight so hard?

468
00:50:14,506 --> 00:50:16,131
A monster...

469
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:20,214
Like a monster.

470
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:29,006
You're a monster, and so am I...

471
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:36,922
Perhaps God knows
why we were born as such monsters.

472
00:50:46,506 --> 00:50:49,339
I came this far...

473
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:55,881
I fled and survived everything...

474
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:02,672
Just face it head-on.

475
00:51:18,381 --> 00:51:20,464
What's the key?

476
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:24,339
The key to completing the exorcism.

477
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,631
Confession.

478
00:51:38,131 --> 00:51:40,422
The monster's true name.

479
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:46,422
I'm Sung-ae, Kang Sung-ae.

480
00:51:57,672 --> 00:52:00,464
The Major Arcana card 5, the Hierophant.

481
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:05,422
The Hierophant is seen with two priests.

482
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,381
Each card has dozens of keywords,

483
00:52:08,464 --> 00:52:12,214
but Hierophant is often drawn
when the situation is constrained.

484
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:13,922
Constrained situations?

485
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:14,714
Yes.

486
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:18,422
The original meaning
of this card isn't strictly the Hierophant-

487
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:21,756
it symbolizes one
who has experienced the divine.

488
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:26,172
This deck is from the Golden Dawn.

489
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:29,547
Monks from the Middle Ages
who studied mysticism within the church.

490
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:31,589
Like the Rosicrucianism.

491
00:52:32,047 --> 00:52:33,006
Take a look.

492
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:36,631
If you see here-

493
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:41,047
when the Knight of Evil appears,
the Emperor is already dead.

494
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:44,714
But the Hierophant
is standing against it, very much alive.

495
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:46,506
The Knight of Evil...

496
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:52,339
The Emperor dies, and the one
who experienced divinity stands up to it?

497
00:52:57,047 --> 00:52:58,881
You're quite the expert.

498
00:53:02,256 --> 00:53:04,589
Also,

499
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:08,422
what's under the Hierophant
is called Saint Peter's Keys.

500
00:53:11,381 --> 00:53:12,922
Card 4, the Emperor...

501
00:53:13,006 --> 00:53:14,922
Card 5, the Hierophant...

502
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:17,131
Then what's Card 6?

503
00:53:23,797 --> 00:53:26,339
Card 6 is the Lovers.

504
00:53:26,422 --> 00:53:29,089
Six represents union and completion.

505
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:38,131
Sister! Where are we going now?

506
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,006
The Hierophant, the two men receiving baptism,

507
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:42,839
which means, we need a third.

508
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:46,881
You don't mean the shaman, right?

509
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:51,506
Do you know any exorcist priests nearby?

510
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:54,589
No way, tell me I'm wrong.

511
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:10,546
<i>Hail Mary</i>

512
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:18,256
<i>full of grace</i>

513
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:28,546
<i>the Lord is with thee.</i>

514
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:49,256
Weren't you going
to teach English to the locals?

515
00:54:50,256 --> 00:54:52,631
People often get sick
when their lifestyle suddenly changes.

516
00:54:52,714 --> 00:54:55,756
Just stick to what Father Kim taught you.

517
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:59,881
What more can you want from a coward like me?

518
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:06,089
You said the
12 Manifestations take animal forms.

519
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:14,714
A serpent that symbolizes Satan,

520
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:18,422
a goat for the sacrificial lamb-

521
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:25,381
Maybe those aren't demons after all.

522
00:55:31,964 --> 00:55:36,714
Whether it's God or a demon,
never trust the manifestations

523
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:39,797
that non-human beings take.

524
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:41,047
Giunia!

525
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:45,131
Because those manifestations are just clues.

526
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:50,214
You taught me that.

527
00:55:50,464 --> 00:55:53,672
You're far too rude to ever be...

528
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:58,839
a proper clergywoman.

529
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,172
Thank you for your guidance.

530
00:56:04,922 --> 00:56:06,547
Father Andrea.

531
00:56:07,714 --> 00:56:12,589
Granted the power and mission
by God to crush the head of Satan,

532
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:16,589
O great Queen of Heaven, Lady of Angels,

533
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:22,506
humbly I implore you to send
the heavenly army at your command

534
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:27,506
to drive the demons into hell,
fight them across the earth,

535
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:29,839
subdue their insolence,

536
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:33,464
and ultimately cast them into hell.

537
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:35,214
Amen.

538
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:11,881
Father Kim and Father Choi
cannot be here to perform the rite.

539
00:57:11,964 --> 00:57:14,881
I deeply regret this point.

540
00:57:21,381 --> 00:57:23,506
They are currently
occupied with other missions,

541
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:27,339
and I am unable to disclose
further details due to confidentiality.

542
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,339
Both Father Kim and the Rosicrucianism

543
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:43,672
believe that the entity possessing
the boy is one of the 12 Manifestations.

544
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:49,797
This is Father Kim's message.

545
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:58,006
"The 12 Manifestations will continue to appear.

546
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:08,797
Save the boy by any means possible."

547
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:13,214
Can't you join us for the exorcism?

548
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:15,797
You're a priest
from the Rosicrucianism, aren't you?

549
00:58:23,714 --> 00:58:26,172
I'm sorry, but I am not allowed.

550
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:34,006
As a servant of God,
I must follow our Lord's plans.

551
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:37,714
We need Saint Peter's Keys
to seal the 12 Manifestations,

552
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:40,339
as well as the Gospel of Peter.

553
00:58:51,256 --> 00:58:53,172
Those are sacred objects.

554
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:56,256
Moreover, they are kept by the Vatican.

555
00:58:56,714 --> 00:59:00,422
These entities are capable
of possessing even priests.

556
00:59:15,172 --> 00:59:17,589
I will help you in every way I can.

557
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:35,839
Kim, you son of a bitch...

558
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:39,381
Isn't he your mentor?

559
00:59:39,756 --> 00:59:41,964
You may curse me later.

560
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,422
Okay...

561
01:00:06,631 --> 01:00:08,881
On the first day
of the lunar month, at the hour of Zi,

562
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:12,297
that is when all forces converge to destroy it.

563
01:00:12,464 --> 01:00:14,797
You must finish
before the hour transition to Chou.

564
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:18,506
Otherwise, its power will grow even stronger.

565
01:00:20,714 --> 01:00:22,881
Should we call Master Dam-eon?

566
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:25,256
No...

567
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:33,589
All the shamans are fully booked
for that day because of the by-elections.

568
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:40,506
Are you serious?

569
01:00:42,214 --> 01:00:44,714
You call that an excuse?

570
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:53,964
That's the day
when all ancestral spirits are on the move.

571
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:58,881
Let's go.

572
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:04,422
I'm sorry, Sung-ae.

573
01:01:05,881 --> 01:01:07,631
Sister Giunia!

574
01:01:20,131 --> 01:01:24,506
So, have you found a place to conduct the rite?

575
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:27,256
I plan to perform it at the boy's residence.

576
01:01:27,339 --> 01:01:29,797
It's a remote area.

577
01:01:29,922 --> 01:01:35,672
The Archdiocese of Seoul has approved
the unofficial exorcism of Choi Hee-joon,

578
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:39,214
and Father Paolo will be participating.

579
01:01:39,381 --> 01:01:42,172
But he isn't even ordained for exorcisms!

580
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:47,089
The Archdiocese has permitted it,
and as the bishop here, I approve it.

581
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:49,422
Father Paolo has received

582
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:56,131
special permission to oversee
Choi Hee-joon's unofficial exorcism.

583
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:59,756
He doesn't even believe in exorcism!

584
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:04,214
And a nun is
not qualified to perform an exorcism.

585
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:09,797
Father Paolo is a priest
of deep faith and knowledge.

586
01:02:10,297 --> 01:02:13,464
Plus, he's a medical doctor.

587
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:17,631
Didn't you send a letter to Father Kim?

588
01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:22,506
I only requested sacred items
needed for the exorcism.

589
01:02:22,589 --> 01:02:26,714
We cannot recklessly entrust
such sacred items for an unofficial exorcism.

590
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:32,672
Father Paolo will personally
bring the sacred items and oversee it.

591
01:02:32,756 --> 01:02:34,839
This is insane...

592
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:37,172
Keep in mind that from now on,

593
01:02:37,256 --> 01:02:41,214
everything you do violates the church law.

594
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:45,964
Your abilities and spirituality
are only vouched for by Father Kim,

595
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:49,589
you're not even a priest of the Rosicrucianism.

596
01:02:50,672 --> 01:02:53,422
If I contact the Rosicrucianism,

597
01:02:53,756 --> 01:02:56,797
could they hand over
the sacred items to me directly?

598
01:02:58,964 --> 01:03:01,839
That might be harder than
performing the exorcism itself.

599
01:03:14,506 --> 01:03:18,381
The Day of Exorcism

600
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:10,631
That was Father Kim's personal opinion,

601
01:04:10,797 --> 01:04:13,422
the Rosicrucianism
holds a different view on the matter.

602
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:16,256
(Italian) In exchange for our full support,

603
01:04:16,339 --> 01:04:23,006
(Italian) you must eliminate
the demon by all means necessary.

604
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:24,589
(Italian) This

605
01:04:24,672 --> 01:04:26,506
(Italian) is our will.

606
01:04:26,631 --> 01:04:31,047
Even if the child might not survive?

607
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:42,881
Malodore.

608
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:46,256
It's the distinct stench of possession.

609
01:05:46,672 --> 01:05:50,256
It means the demon within
has decayed to its very core.

610
01:05:50,589 --> 01:05:53,172
Couldn't you have told me sooner?

611
01:05:54,547 --> 01:05:57,339
Would that have helped you prepare?

612
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:00,256
That stench can't be washed away.

613
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:04,131
It's the main reason
the possessed are ultimately abandoned.

614
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:09,506
Thankfully, the human sense of smell
is the dullest of all, a blessing from God.

615
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:13,797
What a know-it-all.

616
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:18,297
Watch your tone.

617
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:26,339
You should quit smoking.

618
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:29,756
Secondhand smoke is worse.

619
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:56,589
The air feels too cold today.

620
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,006
What about the manual?

621
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:34,714
Is this a surgery?
There's no manual for a Dark Nun.

622
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:36,297
Right.

623
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:38,672
There's only one rule for this exorcism:

624
01:07:38,756 --> 01:07:41,506
use any means necessary.

625
01:09:01,172 --> 01:09:04,381
It's begun.

626
01:09:06,256 --> 01:09:08,006
What's that?

627
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:09,964
Cotton flowers.

628
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,756
They symbolize the Goddess of Birth.

629
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:14,672
What?

630
01:09:14,756 --> 01:09:18,839
She's the ancestral deity
who oversaw Hee-joon's birth.

631
01:09:19,422 --> 01:09:21,839
He's destined to be a shaman.

632
01:09:22,381 --> 01:09:25,006
His ancestors will lend their aid.

633
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:28,256
Are you a shaman or a nun?

634
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:35,714
Never disregard any information
about a possessed person.

635
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,381
Still, we're nuns, you know?

636
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:42,756
Even in Europe, they summon
guardian spirits during exorcisms.

637
01:09:43,589 --> 01:09:47,506
Getting approval for an exorcism
is nearly impossible anywhere.

638
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:16,631
Lord, even though we use any means necessary,

639
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:20,589
our hearts remain true to You, please, help us.

640
01:10:31,672 --> 01:10:33,589
Check him again.

641
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:35,131
What?

642
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:38,131
You're a doctor, aren't you?

643
01:10:38,464 --> 01:10:39,797
Yes.

644
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:20,339
Even the demon knows.

645
01:11:22,506 --> 01:11:24,797
It knows what you fear.

646
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:52,797
It shows you visions.

647
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:56,464
It makes you relive your trauma,

648
01:11:57,172 --> 01:11:59,339
driving you to want to die.

649
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:16,131
(Latin) And you, son of man,
do not be afraid of them,

650
01:12:17,089 --> 01:12:20,047
(Latin) do not fear their words,

651
01:12:20,214 --> 01:12:24,881
(Latin) for they are rebellious
and deceitful around you,

652
01:12:25,297 --> 01:12:31,131
(Latin) and even if you
dwell among scorpions and thorns.

653
01:12:31,756 --> 01:12:35,131
(Latin) Do not be dismayed at their faces,

654
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:38,506
(Latin) for they are a rebellious house.

655
01:13:12,297 --> 01:13:18,172
<i>May your faith save this child.</i>

656
01:13:18,506 --> 01:13:21,547
<i>May God's blessing be with you.</i>

657
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:25,172
Bach Cantatas BWV140

658
01:13:25,256 --> 01:13:29,047
Wake, Awake, for Night is Flying

659
01:13:29,464 --> 01:13:31,256
Are you ready?

660
01:13:31,339 --> 01:13:34,131
It's all over when we find out its name.

661
01:13:34,547 --> 01:13:35,589
Yes, Sister.

662
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:38,589
Try not to look directly into his eyes.

663
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:43,131
If you start experiencing visions,
hide behind the icon

664
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:46,006
or stand behind me.

665
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:47,839
Yes, Sister.

666
01:13:52,214 --> 01:13:54,256
Begin the prayer.

667
01:14:04,922 --> 01:14:06,631
<i>(Latin) Lord, have mercy.</i>

668
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:07,964
<i>(Latin) Lord, our God,</i>

669
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:10,047
<i>King of all ages, Almighty Father,</i>

670
01:14:10,131 --> 01:14:12,922
<i>(Latin) who created all things and change them</i>

671
01:14:13,006 --> 01:14:15,297
<i>(Latin) according to Your will...</i>

672
01:14:15,381 --> 01:14:17,172
<i>(Latin)... who in Babylon
turned the burning flames</i>

673
01:14:17,256 --> 01:14:18,839
Sister...

674
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:20,547
Thank you...

675
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:22,506
<i>(Latin) of the furnace into refreshing dew...</i>

676
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:24,922
I'm okay now...

677
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:32,381
Where's my mom?

678
01:14:32,631 --> 01:14:35,089
I want to go to my mom...

679
01:14:35,922 --> 01:14:39,589
Lord, have mercy.

680
01:14:39,839 --> 01:14:42,047
I want to see my mom...

681
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:43,839
Sister...

682
01:14:48,256 --> 01:14:50,297
It's suffocating...

683
01:14:50,714 --> 01:14:53,881
Can you untie this, please?

684
01:14:54,422 --> 01:14:56,172
Sister Kang Sung-ae...

685
01:14:59,964 --> 01:15:03,714
When did I ever tell you my name?

686
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:07,381
You fucking bitch!

687
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:10,714
<i>(Latin) Lord, who is the salvation of all,</i>

688
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:11,672
<i>(Latin) and who cleanses
all sorcery and witchcraft,</i>

689
01:15:13,256 --> 01:15:15,172
<i>(Latin) may Your servant</i>

690
01:15:15,172 --> 01:15:18,047
<i>sing with gratitude
under Your protection and faith.</i>

691
01:15:23,006 --> 01:15:24,172
I hate it...

692
01:15:24,422 --> 01:15:29,464
I hate being unable
to move my hands and feet...

693
01:15:29,839 --> 01:15:31,756
I'm so scared...

694
01:15:32,214 --> 01:15:33,756
Please, let me out of here...

695
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:36,881
The bullies, they're coming after me!

696
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:38,714
Please, save me...

697
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:45,589
<i>Lord, Almighty and Master of all ages,</i>

698
01:15:45,922 --> 01:15:48,839
<i>You created all things and change them</i>

699
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:51,047
<i>according to Your will.</i>

700
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:53,839
<i>You, who saved and protected

<i>from the fiery furnace

702
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:01,964
<i>- You are the healer of our souls</i>
- I can't... I just can't...

703
01:16:02,047 --> 01:16:05,172
<i>- and the salvation of those who seek You.</i>
- I can't, I can't, I can't!

704
01:16:15,756 --> 01:16:17,381
Piss off, you filthy bitch!

705
01:16:24,381 --> 01:16:26,506
Raise the breaker, and relight the candles.

706
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:38,547
Just turn it off!

707
01:16:39,047 --> 01:16:40,547
Yes, Sister.

708
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,672
Sister...

709
01:16:54,214 --> 01:16:56,339
This isn't a demon...

710
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:59,172
It protected me...

711
01:17:00,422 --> 01:17:02,131
It killed your mom.

712
01:17:03,006 --> 01:17:05,256
It hurt your friends.

713
01:17:05,464 --> 01:17:08,422
It's a spirit protecting me...

714
01:17:09,881 --> 01:17:14,297
You understand, don't you?

715
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:16,922
It's a demon.

716
01:17:17,464 --> 01:17:19,256
It will never protect you.

717
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:23,297
Don't doubt me, I won't disappoint you.

718
01:17:24,881 --> 01:17:27,047
You still want me, don't you?

719
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:30,506
I slaughtered your bitch mother.

720
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:33,672
I slaughtered your bitch mother.

721
01:17:33,756 --> 01:17:36,214
I slaughtered your bitch mother!

722
01:17:36,297 --> 01:17:39,297
You conniving bitch! Whore!

723
01:17:40,547 --> 01:17:42,756
How long have you starved?

724
01:17:47,756 --> 01:17:49,881
It's dirty! Filthy!

725
01:17:50,006 --> 01:17:53,381
Remove your hand! It's filthy!

726
01:17:53,672 --> 01:17:55,547
You whore!

727
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:57,506
Remove your hand!

728
01:18:04,297 --> 01:18:05,839
Useless shit!

729
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:08,922
- How dare you!
<i>- And the savior of those who seek You.</i>

730
01:18:09,006 --> 01:18:10,797
<i>We beseech You...</i>

731
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,381
You deceitful woman,
lying about getting raped by your god!

732
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:20,547
Whore of a god! Filthy bitch!

733
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:22,506
<i>(Latin) Your humble servant</i>

734
01:18:22,506 --> 01:18:24,756
<i>may sing under Your protection and faith.</i>

735
01:18:31,089 --> 01:18:33,131
<i>Protect us from every curse,</i>

736
01:18:33,214 --> 01:18:35,922
<i>from the malicious gazes of the wicked!</i>

737
01:18:36,006 --> 01:18:39,131
<i>And from every wicked
act committed against Your servant!</i>

738
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,464
<i>(Latin) Extend Your powerful hands
and Your highest and strongest arms,</i>

739
01:18:41,547 --> 01:18:43,756
<i>(Latin) and come to aid
and visit this Your image,</i>

740
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,381
<i>(Latin) and send upon it Your angel of mercy,</i>

741
01:18:46,464 --> 01:18:49,381
<i>(Latin) a strong
and faithful guardian of soul and body.</i>

742
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:20,714
You are Jesus' trash!

743
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,172
You drool all night,
lusting to kill whenever you see young ones!

744
01:19:24,256 --> 01:19:29,339
Demon, I command you
reveal your true identity.

745
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,589
(Latin) Demon, I command you!

746
01:19:31,672 --> 01:19:33,089
(Latin) Tell me who you are!

747
01:19:33,172 --> 01:19:36,131
Asking for my name this early?

748
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:39,631
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to reveal your name!

749
01:19:39,714 --> 01:19:43,214
(Latin) In the name of Jesus Christ,

750
01:19:43,297 --> 01:19:45,297
(Latin) reveal your name!

751
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:50,339
(Latin) In the name of Jesus Christ,

752
01:19:50,756 --> 01:19:53,131
(Latin) reveal your name!

753
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:55,631
Don't you get it yet?

754
01:19:56,214 --> 01:19:58,297
I won't be fooled by your tricks.

755
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:01,381
You're just a snake slithering out of the sea.

756
01:20:02,922 --> 01:20:04,714
(Latin) You will die!

757
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:10,756
(Latin) The son of Mary

758
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:14,047
died nailed to the cross,

759
01:20:14,922 --> 01:20:20,172
(Latin) you'll die with a tumor in your womb,

760
01:20:20,422 --> 01:20:23,089
(Latin) unable to even bear children.

761
01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:34,422
Possessing a faithless child,

762
01:20:34,506 --> 01:20:36,964
you're a pathetic creature
that only hunts the weak!

763
01:20:38,464 --> 01:20:40,422
(Latin) Lord, have mercy.

764
01:20:40,797 --> 01:20:44,506
Pretending to react to the cross,

765
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,339
only to slither away like an eel.

766
01:20:48,131 --> 01:20:51,214
You're just a deceitful, insignificant spirit!

767
01:20:51,631 --> 01:20:53,756
A lowly beast's soul at that!

768
01:21:10,589 --> 01:21:11,839
Sister!

769
01:21:12,756 --> 01:21:15,547
We've been waiting for 233 years.

770
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:21,589
I was there in 1791, 1846, and 1866.

771
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:25,256
We were involved in the deaths
of the 103 martyrs you revere.

772
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,131
And now...

773
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:31,422
we will kill the children!

774
01:21:31,506 --> 01:21:35,297
Starting with this child,
we will kill 292, then 471,

775
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:37,756
until the number reaches 2,340!

776
01:21:37,839 --> 01:21:41,881
The children will perish on land,
in the mountains, and in the skies.

777
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:46,672
Mark my words: this child is the beginning.

778
01:21:47,464 --> 01:21:50,672
The beginning of your devastating defeat.

779
01:21:53,797 --> 01:21:55,339
"We"?

780
01:21:56,631 --> 01:21:58,797
There's just one of you.

781
01:21:58,922 --> 01:22:02,006
We are one and all.

782
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:04,547
Foolish woman!

783
01:22:04,964 --> 01:22:07,089
Clinging to your pitiful prayers...

784
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,256
You pathetic humans
lost the ability to think for yourselves!

785
01:22:10,631 --> 01:22:13,714
A beast protected by a filthy legion!

786
01:22:13,964 --> 01:22:15,881
Tell me your name!

787
01:22:16,714 --> 01:22:19,672
You always start
with commands, never with a plea!

788
01:22:19,881 --> 01:22:21,631
Stupid wretch!

789
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,131
Say your name!

790
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:30,881
Do not fear, my son,

791
01:22:31,256 --> 01:22:33,672
for I am your father.

792
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:36,672
Then tell me with your own mouth.

793
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:39,256
What is your name?

794
01:22:39,506 --> 01:22:43,464
If you're going to command me,
do it with some authority!

795
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:48,006
You dare face me?

796
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:52,214
How dare you pray? Kneel to me instead!

797
01:22:52,422 --> 01:22:55,422
I am the sacred one you must kneel to!

798
01:22:58,839 --> 01:23:00,589
Worship me instead!

799
01:23:00,672 --> 01:23:02,881
Shut up and say your name!

800
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:06,214
God created mankind?

801
01:23:07,422 --> 01:23:09,131
What nonsense!

802
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:12,672
Is this Almighty God's masterpiece?

803
01:23:12,839 --> 01:23:17,922
Pathetic fools, drunk on power
and slaughtering each other?

804
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:31,214
Forget about us, just tell us who you are.

805
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,756
Who are you, and why are you here?

806
01:23:34,881 --> 01:23:36,797
I told you, didn't I?

807
01:23:38,256 --> 01:23:41,089
I hated you.

808
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:44,714
I hated you!

809
01:23:45,256 --> 01:23:47,589
I hated you! I hated you!

810
01:23:47,797 --> 01:23:49,797
I hated you! I hated you!

811
01:23:50,006 --> 01:23:51,464
I hated you!

812
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,756
I hated you!

813
01:23:54,506 --> 01:23:56,131
I hated you!

814
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:59,631
I hated you! I hated you!

815
01:24:26,422 --> 01:24:28,922
Bring me Saint Peter's scripture and the keys.

816
01:24:29,714 --> 01:24:30,881
Hurry.

817
01:24:43,214 --> 01:24:45,131
Hey!

818
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:55,422
What do we do now?

819
01:24:55,797 --> 01:25:01,297
You're a shaman
who should've died performing a ritual,

820
01:25:02,422 --> 01:25:06,172
so why are you here
cloaked in the rags of Jesus?

821
01:25:07,131 --> 01:25:10,922
You're possessed by a spirit, so, why?

822
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:15,339
Why don't you ask the cards
you worship more than God?

823
01:25:15,464 --> 01:25:16,881
Shut up!

824
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:23,672
It's not over yet.

825
01:25:23,839 --> 01:25:26,006
We can't end it like this.

826
01:25:26,339 --> 01:25:28,672
Sister, please, just tell me what to do!

827
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:32,547
I'll do whatever you say, Sister!

828
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:35,006
No one born of a woman...

829
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:36,047
Sister, please!

830
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,756
can oppose us!

831
01:25:41,214 --> 01:25:45,547
<i>Profound Dharma, rare to encounter.</i>

832
01:25:45,631 --> 01:25:52,089
<i>By fortune, I now find it.</i>

833
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:56,047
Who's this worthless shaman? Shut the hell up!

834
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:59,297
<i>I seek the Tathagata's truth.</i>

835
01:26:07,006 --> 01:26:09,964
Want to save a person with me?

836
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:12,881
What?

837
01:26:12,964 --> 01:26:16,256
Hee-joon, remember him?

838
01:26:18,839 --> 01:26:23,339
We're going to exorcise him,
but we need another priest.

839
01:26:23,672 --> 01:26:25,881
Me... m-m-me?

840
01:26:26,506 --> 01:26:31,381
The essence of prayer is sincerity, isn't it?

841
01:26:35,172 --> 01:26:38,922
To be honest, it's my first time too.

842
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:01,714
D-don't die!

843
01:27:03,172 --> 01:27:04,547
Hee-joon!

844
01:27:04,631 --> 01:27:08,256
I... c-can't write a talisman yet...

845
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:10,756
So... so here...

846
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:13,797
at least t-t-take this...

847
01:27:22,006 --> 01:27:27,464
<i>Mantra of the Dharma Treasury, Om Aranam Arada.</i>

848
01:27:27,589 --> 01:27:32,047
<i>Om Aranam Arada.</i>

849
01:27:32,756 --> 01:27:34,464
You damn pests!

850
01:27:34,547 --> 01:27:37,672
Shut up before I rip your mouth apart! Shut it!

851
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:42,172
<i>Great mountains,
small mountains, mountain spirit gods.</i>

852
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:45,881
<i>Great strikes,
small strikes, mountain spirit gods.</i>

853
01:27:46,339 --> 01:27:48,214
<i>Great evils, small evils,
vanish from this place.</i>

854
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:50,381
His stuttering is gone.

855
01:27:53,756 --> 01:27:56,297
Those who've experienced divinity,

856
01:27:56,756 --> 01:27:58,339
three.

857
01:28:05,797 --> 01:28:08,631
<i>Bow to the guest spirits,
spirits of the land.</i>

858
01:28:08,714 --> 01:28:12,006
(Latin) Shut up already!
Shut that fool's mouth!

859
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:16,797
<i>Bow to the mountain spirits,
let go of all obstacles.</i>

860
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:19,756
<i>Spirits of the soil, protect with sacrifice!</i>

861
01:28:27,506 --> 01:28:31,839
<i>Today, at this very moment,
we seek blessings to go far.</i>

862
01:28:31,922 --> 01:28:36,547
<i>Each and every place, beyond a thousand miles.</i>

863
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:43,047
<i>Otherworldly beings, do not return.</i>

864
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:46,131
<i>Hurry, follow the law of the cycle, Svaha!</i>

865
01:28:46,214 --> 01:28:49,881
<i>Hurry, follow the law of the cycle, Svaha!</i>

866
01:28:53,506 --> 01:28:55,381
Lord who loves humanity.

867
01:28:56,256 --> 01:28:58,297
Protector of souls and bodies.

868
01:28:58,381 --> 01:29:01,381
Send the angel of peace and strength,

869
01:29:01,464 --> 01:29:05,547
visit and aid this child,
created in Your image.

870
01:29:07,714 --> 01:29:10,172
In the name of the Son and the Holy Spirit...

871
01:29:27,214 --> 01:29:30,381
(Latin) I have not come to ruin your lives!

872
01:29:31,214 --> 01:29:34,381
(Latin) I am your savior!

873
01:29:35,422 --> 01:29:38,714
He stole the scripture and fled?

874
01:29:38,839 --> 01:29:44,381
Master, should I
send my men to catch that bastard?

875
01:29:44,631 --> 01:29:46,256
Leave it.

876
01:29:48,589 --> 01:29:53,214
Everyone there is going to die today.

877
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,589
Crazy bitch...

878
01:30:09,672 --> 01:30:12,714
<i>Bow to the guest spirits, spirits of the land.</i>

879
01:30:12,797 --> 01:30:15,214
<i>Protect with the
self-sacrifice of the household.</i>

880
01:30:39,756 --> 01:30:45,256
<i>Today, at this very moment,
seek blessings to go far.</i>

881
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:48,756
<i>Most holy and glorious Mother of God,</i>

882
01:30:48,839 --> 01:30:51,964
<i>eternal Virgin Mary
and the Archangels who radiate light,</i>

883
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:55,381
<i>I plead in the names of all Your saints.</i>

884
01:30:55,464 --> 01:30:58,714
<i>- Be with us brothers always and everywhere.</i>
- Shut up!

885
01:30:58,797 --> 01:30:59,797
<i>- In the name of the Father, the Son,</i>
- Shut up!

886
01:30:59,881 --> 01:31:01,922
<i>and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>

887
01:31:06,756 --> 01:31:08,256
I ask you,

888
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,881
what are your names?

889
01:31:11,297 --> 01:31:13,172
First murderer.

890
01:31:13,297 --> 01:31:15,381
Where did you come from?

891
01:31:16,256 --> 01:31:19,839
Even in the muzzle of the guns
you humans point at each other,

892
01:31:19,922 --> 01:31:24,381
in polluted wells,
and in cities built on deserts...

893
01:31:24,464 --> 01:31:28,756
in all places where gravity exists,
I have been with you.

894
01:31:31,797 --> 01:31:37,214
(Latin) O humans,
who cannot fully understand gravity,

895
01:31:37,422 --> 01:31:39,589
(Latin) I am the God...

896
01:32:00,172 --> 01:32:03,422
It hurts... Please save me...

897
01:32:04,131 --> 01:32:08,214
Sister... Please save me...

898
01:32:10,006 --> 01:32:14,089
<i>The Lord is my shepherd,
with Him, who can harm me?</i>

899
01:32:14,172 --> 01:32:17,714
<i>I do not fear because I am with You, my God.</i>

900
01:32:19,672 --> 01:32:23,714
Sister... Please save me...

901
01:32:23,797 --> 01:32:25,131
You're right.

902
01:32:25,631 --> 01:32:30,297
I'll imprison you within my womb.

903
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,547
How dare you...

904
01:32:36,756 --> 01:32:41,339
even consider forcing me into your rotten womb?

905
01:32:45,339 --> 01:32:50,339
The filthy womb
where you promised purity to Him?

906
01:32:51,464 --> 01:32:55,214
Consider it an honor, you worthless horse head.

907
01:32:58,922 --> 01:33:02,339
You crazy wench, go ahead and try!

908
01:33:02,547 --> 01:33:06,214
Come, embrace me! I'll be reborn as a demon!

909
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:09,422
I'll honor you as my mother!

910
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:18,839
<i>Mountain spirits of
the western and southern mountains!</i>

911
01:33:27,964 --> 01:33:30,131
<i>Mountain spirits
of the great and small mountains!</i>

912
01:33:30,464 --> 01:33:32,756
<i>Spirits of great strikes and small strikes!</i>

913
01:33:33,131 --> 01:33:35,047
<i>Great evils and small evils,</i>

914
01:33:36,464 --> 01:33:39,256
What's your name, you vile spirit?

915
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:43,464
Sister...

916
01:33:44,172 --> 01:33:45,547
Your name.

917
01:33:45,631 --> 01:33:47,422
Call me 'Annihilation.'

918
01:33:47,672 --> 01:33:51,006
You're bacteria that
make rotten fruit decay even further.

919
01:33:51,089 --> 01:33:52,256
Your name!

920
01:33:52,339 --> 01:33:56,214
I existed everywhere since the beginning.

921
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,672
Those who fear us
call us the 12 Manifestations.

922
01:34:00,172 --> 01:34:03,547
Do you dare
call yourself the 12 Manifestations?

923
01:34:14,756 --> 01:34:18,131
Hee-joon... Hee-joon...

924
01:34:24,422 --> 01:34:27,922
Hee-joon! Please hang in there!

925
01:34:28,256 --> 01:34:31,714
Come forth, come forth!

926
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:40,922
You cowardly spirit dwelling
in a weak child! Pathetic wretch!

927
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:45,631
You're nothing more than a bug,
found in every corner!

928
01:34:45,714 --> 01:34:49,797
A worthless shadow at night,
a minion of the 12 Manifestations!

929
01:34:49,881 --> 01:34:51,131
A servant of evil bowing

930
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:53,672
before an unordained nun!

931
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:55,381
A mere pony of Marbas!

932
01:34:55,464 --> 01:35:00,464
How dare you call me a lowly spirit...

933
01:35:00,547 --> 01:35:02,797
You, of all people...

934
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:07,339
You arrogant wretch... You filthy woman!

935
01:35:09,922 --> 01:35:12,589
I am none other than the Grand Duke of Hell!

936
01:35:12,672 --> 01:35:14,214
Tell me your name.

937
01:35:14,922 --> 01:35:18,672
Tell me and make me tremble in fear!

938
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:23,964
I am the Grand Duke of Hell.

939
01:35:25,006 --> 01:35:27,381
I am Gamigin!

940
01:35:42,922 --> 01:35:46,714
<i>Granted the power and mission
by God to crush the head of Satan,</i>

941
01:35:46,797 --> 01:35:49,547
<i>O great Queen of Heaven, Lady of Angels,</i>

942
01:35:49,631 --> 01:35:54,214
<i>humbly I implore you
to send the heavenly army at your command</i>

943
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:58,297
<i>to drive the demons into hell,
fight them across the earth,</i>

944
01:35:58,381 --> 01:36:00,464
<i>subdue their insolence,</i>

945
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:03,756
<i>and ultimately cast them into hell.</i>

946
01:36:03,839 --> 01:36:05,381
<i>Amen.</i>

947
01:36:06,089 --> 01:36:11,672
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, I command you,</i>

948
01:36:12,006 --> 01:36:14,672
Gamigin! Come out of there!

949
01:36:49,464 --> 01:36:53,797
Lord, humans feel such sorrow...

950
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:03,381
yet the sea remains so blue.

951
01:37:19,214 --> 01:37:22,506
Thank you, Sister.

952
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,714
You've done well.

953
01:37:33,506 --> 01:37:36,589
Lord, hear our prayers.

954
01:37:36,672 --> 01:37:39,297
Saint Michael, hear our prayers.

955
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:41,839
Saint Gabriel, hear our prayers.

956
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:44,506
Saint Raphael, hear our prayers.

957
01:37:45,256 --> 01:37:47,839
Lord, hear our prayers.

958
01:37:47,922 --> 01:37:50,381
Saint Michael, hear our praye...

959
01:37:53,714 --> 01:37:55,214
Sister...

960
01:37:57,256 --> 01:37:59,047
Are you okay?

961
01:38:01,464 --> 01:38:02,672
Good job.

962
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:41,797
Look after Hee-joon first.

963
01:39:10,006 --> 01:39:12,881
Take him to the nearest church.

964
01:39:13,089 --> 01:39:16,964
Gamigin will try to return to Hee-joon's body.

965
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:19,047
Hurry, go.

966
01:39:19,422 --> 01:39:21,297
What about you?

967
01:39:23,006 --> 01:39:26,339
Ring the church
bell three times from the tower.

968
01:39:26,506 --> 01:39:27,756
So that I can hear it.

969
01:39:27,839 --> 01:39:29,631
What about you?

970
01:39:39,672 --> 01:39:41,506
For heaven's sake...

971
01:39:42,131 --> 01:39:45,547
Go, there's no time.

972
01:39:46,256 --> 01:39:47,756
You need to save Hee-joon.

973
01:39:47,839 --> 01:39:52,964
I... I don't want to.

974
01:39:53,047 --> 01:39:54,964
No... Let's find another way...

975
01:39:55,047 --> 01:39:57,589
There must be another way, please?

976
01:39:58,047 --> 01:40:00,547
Save Hee-joon.

977
01:40:04,006 --> 01:40:06,589
You're insane...

978
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:12,839
You crazy bitch!

979
01:40:36,422 --> 01:40:42,172
In the name of
Lord Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary,

980
01:40:42,839 --> 01:40:47,589
I command you, leave at once.

981
01:40:55,047 --> 01:40:56,631
<i>Lord...</i>

982
01:40:56,714 --> 01:41:01,839
<i>Delay judgment and grant me
the wisdom to save my neighbor.</i>

983
01:41:03,506 --> 01:41:05,839
<i>Bestow upon us the grace of salvation.</i>

984
01:41:06,631 --> 01:41:11,589
<i>Lord, please watch over us.</i>

985
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:14,089
Step aside! Please, step aside!

986
01:42:14,172 --> 01:42:15,297
I'm sorry!

987
01:42:15,381 --> 01:42:16,964
I'm sorry! Please move aside!

988
01:42:17,047 --> 01:42:18,922
Please move!

989
01:42:19,006 --> 01:42:20,172
Make way! I'm sorry!

990
01:42:20,256 --> 01:42:21,006
Out of the way!

991
01:42:21,089 --> 01:42:22,381
Shit!

992
01:42:22,839 --> 01:42:23,589
Is this nun crazy?

993
01:42:23,672 --> 01:42:24,464
Let me go!

994
01:42:24,547 --> 01:42:26,381
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

995
01:42:27,089 --> 01:42:28,214
Shit!

996
01:42:28,964 --> 01:42:30,297
Are you insane?!

997
01:42:54,547 --> 01:42:56,172
I'm okay...

998
01:42:58,131 --> 01:42:59,297
Get going!

999
01:43:00,714 --> 01:43:01,964
Just go!

1000
01:43:10,922 --> 01:43:12,547
Leave us,

1001
01:43:13,589 --> 01:43:16,131
and never return to this place.

1002
01:43:17,422 --> 01:43:20,964
Never touch us again.

1003
01:43:21,672 --> 01:43:24,381
Never hurt the children again.

1004
01:43:25,756 --> 01:43:29,214
<i>Lord Jesus Christ, Holy Virgin Mary,</i>

1005
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:35,131
<i>and Saint Michael
the Archangel, fight for us, please.</i>

1006
01:44:56,589 --> 01:44:57,839
I'm sorry...

1007
01:44:57,922 --> 01:44:59,214
I'm sorry.

1008
01:45:02,381 --> 01:45:03,797
Just a moment!

1009
01:45:06,839 --> 01:45:08,297
Hee-joon!

1010
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:12,422
Hee-joon!

1011
01:45:27,756 --> 01:45:31,256
Go to the hospital with Hee-joon.

1012
01:45:32,089 --> 01:45:35,672
I need to go to Sister Giunia.

1013
01:45:35,756 --> 01:45:37,756
N-no, you can't!

1014
01:45:37,839 --> 01:45:40,381
I have to go check on her!

1015
01:45:46,047 --> 01:45:47,297
Sister, are you okay?

1016
01:45:47,381 --> 01:45:49,756
It's okay, I'm fine.

1017
01:46:22,672 --> 01:46:25,047
O Immaculate Virgin,

1018
01:46:25,672 --> 01:46:28,547
angels and archangels,

1019
01:46:29,714 --> 01:46:31,922
all the saints in heaven,

1020
01:46:33,631 --> 01:46:35,881
descend upon me.

1021
01:46:39,631 --> 01:46:42,631
Melt me, renew me,

1022
01:46:43,256 --> 01:46:48,214
cast all evils into the fires of hell,

1023
01:46:48,964 --> 01:46:53,339
fill me with Your presence
and use me as Your tool...

1024
01:46:55,714 --> 01:46:58,422
So that they may never again touch

1025
01:46:58,964 --> 01:47:01,464
any of the creatures of this world.

1026
01:47:03,381 --> 01:47:07,672
Please protect us.

1027
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:36,464
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,

1028
01:47:37,547 --> 01:47:39,714
and of the Holy Spirit.

1029
01:47:44,714 --> 01:47:46,297
Amen.

1030
01:48:06,964 --> 01:48:08,839
The Rosicrucianism Parish

1031
01:48:08,922 --> 01:48:11,839
(Italian) I didn't think you'd come in person.

1032
01:48:12,881 --> 01:48:17,214
(Italian) I'm the one responsible
for the rite in question.

1033
01:48:18,047 --> 01:48:20,006
(Italian) How is the boy?

1034
01:48:20,172 --> 01:48:22,506
(Italian) I heard you've been
taking care of him personally.

1035
01:48:22,589 --> 01:48:29,672
(Italian) He's recovering quickly
but it will still take a long time.

1036
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:33,714
(Italian) Yes! But...

1037
01:48:36,339 --> 01:48:37,797
(Italian) Yes?

1038
01:48:37,881 --> 01:48:43,172
(Italian) I heard you
weren't particularly fond of us...

1039
01:48:47,172 --> 01:48:51,839
(Italian) Let's just say
we were very cautious about the rite.

1040
01:48:54,297 --> 01:48:56,256
(Italian) I wasn't serious...

1041
01:48:57,297 --> 01:49:02,297
(Italian) We all have freedom, free to choose.

1042
01:49:03,047 --> 01:49:05,172
(Italian) Both you, me,

1043
01:49:05,422 --> 01:49:07,464
(Italian) and Sister Giunia.

1044
01:49:15,589 --> 01:49:25,588
(Kang Sung-ae Sister Giunia)

1045
01:50:15,089 --> 01:50:17,131
Where are we going?

1046
01:50:18,214 --> 01:50:22,631
Wherever the 12 Manifestations show up.

1047
01:50:27,131 --> 01:50:29,756
Do you think I can do this?

1048
01:50:33,006 --> 01:50:35,422
You've already learned everything.

1049
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:42,631
I was told Sister Giunia
taught you everything you need to know.

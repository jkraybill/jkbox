1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,729
Powertron!

2
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,315
Special Attack!

3
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:32,157
Curses!
I'll get you next time, Powertron!

4
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,993
Hold it, Kingburg!

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,204
Dammit! Did he get away?

6
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:42,125
However, we Powertrons will uphold
the peace of the network!

7
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,294
Yeah!

8
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,822
That was nothing like the stuff on TV.

9
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,806
That was so cheap!

10
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,228
Man, that's like way too expensive.

11
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,731
Like I said,
it's from that show in Hiroshima.

12
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,149
The one I couldn't go to?

13
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,529
When Rei went fumbling her song
'coz those guys started trouble...

14
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,867
And this is the MiniDisc from when
Mima sang in Rei's place.

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,035
It's a precious sample of
Mimarin's singing voice!

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,830
Oh, yeah... Is that rumor true?

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,290
Oh, that?

18
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,042
Three left, only three left...

19
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,047
Last issue of CHAMMINGBIRD...
only three left.

20
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,009
400 yen... 400 yen...

21
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,385
Yeah, I read about that too.

22
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,305
I heard she's announcing it today
coz it's the last concert here.

23
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:41,143
At a nothing show like this?
That's pretty cold of Mimarin!

24
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,229
There's been lots of solo
activity going on lately...

25
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,274
And only Mimarin's like
worthy of being an actress?

26
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,401
Look, they're back.

27
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,778
The guys that caused trouble last week.

28
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:56,158
I just hope they don't make
a mess today, of all days.

29
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,537
I'm getting nervous!

30
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,414
Come on, sit still!

31
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,958
Hey, what's up with this!?
This is all frayed!

32
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,084
Don't look at me!

33
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,962
- Get me some masking tape!
- Hello? Yes.

34
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,632
Remember your entrance
in the second song, Mima!

35
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,425
Don't pressure me!

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,593
I need a drink!

37
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,476
- I'm sorry. I'll call you back.
- You can have drinks after the event.

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,097
You're on!

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,103
<i>And it looks like they're set.</i>

40
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:32,444
<i>Without further adieu, please welcome
to our stage... CHAM!!</i>

41
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:10,065
<i>Got a question about your love?</i>

42
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:15,946
<i>Send a cry for help and wait a bit.</i>

43
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,825
<i>Love makes your heart race.</i>

44
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>If it means you're loved in the end...</i>

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,331
<i>be much more aggressive...</i>

46
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,710
<i>because you will get a chance.</i>

47
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:37,793
<i>The angel of love smiles at you.</i>

48
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,876
Mima! Mima! Mima!

49
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,471
<i>Mima should be acting, not singing!</i>

50
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,727
<i>I can't do this after all!</i>

51
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,520
<i>Mika...</i>

52
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,356
They want her in a drama series.

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,275
There are no better deals than this!

54
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,111
She can act AND sing!
That should be all right!

55
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,448
Her schedule with the other two
is already starting to mismatch!

56
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,285
She didn't go through those hard
lessons to become an actress!

57
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,914
The TV producer praised Mima's acting!

58
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,375
But what about MIMA'S feelings!?

59
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,544
<i>And wait a bit.</i>

60
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,381
<i>Love makes your heart race.</i>

61
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,593
<i>If it means you're loved in the end...</i>

62
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,846
<i>be much more aggressive...</i>

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,391
<i>because you will get a chance.</i>

64
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:16,274
<i>The angel of love smiles at you.</i>

65
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,039
Thank you very much.

66
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:35,168
It was a fun concert, but we
only have one song left...

67
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,587
We just got here!

68
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:45,595
Umm... Before our last song,
we have news to tell you...

69
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,976
Um, I, Mima Kirigoe, had a fun
time as a member of CHAM...

70
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,520
Out of the way!

71
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,523
What did we do!? HUH!?

72
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,990
Quit showin' off!
You're only a part-timer!

73
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,241
Outta my face, ya asshole!

74
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,659
YOU get out of here!

75
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,787
What the hell!? Who are you
telling to leave, you fucker!?

76
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,706
It wasn't me!

77
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,585
What are you doing!? Get the hell
over here, whoever threw that!

78
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,545
Go home! Go home!

79
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,007
- Dammit!
- Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!

80
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,426
Them again!

81
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,719
We're canceling the show!

82
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,012
But today is!

83
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,975
Shut up! Goddammit!

84
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,979
Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!

85
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,564
Stop it!

86
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,947
Today...

87
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,034
Just today... I wanted to have
a good time with all of you!

88
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,289
What attitude from some no-namer!

89
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,292
You little!?

90
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,381
What do you want, you freak?

91
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,800
Let's go!

92
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:25,528
A-Actually... as of today, I...

93
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,407
As of today,
Mima will graduate from CHAM!

94
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,911
- What!?
- Why?

95
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,415
Thank you all.

96
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:43,338
I'm really happy that I spent the last
2 1/2 years with you all as part of CHAM!

97
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:50,345
I hope you'll support me as
I do my best as a rookie actress.

98
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,976
So this will be my last song.
Please listen.

99
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,656
Well, it totally makes sense from
the agency's point of view.

100
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,075
Pop idols just don't make money... right?

101
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,077
Metamorphosis, huh?

102
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,248
<i>I still remember well...</i>

103
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,460
<i>that warmth you'd given me.</i>

104
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:29,384
<i>It was in the gentle rays of sunlight.</i>

105
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:35,265
<i>I had believed that...</i>

106
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,436
<i>the days past when...</i>

107
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:47,485
<i>we were in love, were everything.</i>

108
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,906
<i>Now, embraced by the memories...</i>

109
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,036
<i>I have become a coward.</i>

110
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,290
<i>I am choosing to live a life that...</i>

111
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,042
<i>I can't feel any...</i>

112
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,463
- Mimarin!
- Don't leave us! Don't quit!

113
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,637
Mimarin! Mimarin!

114
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,681
Thank you.

115
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,143
I'm always looking at Mima's Room!

116
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:45,293
Geez! This cheese already went bad!

117
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,811
I'm sorry...
I forgot to feed you yesterday.

118
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,952
<i>The earthquake that happened
in Mie prefecture...</i>

119
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,996
<i>flattened towns throughout the region.</i>

120
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,002
<i>The government reports 200 dead, but
the total number of victims are...</i>

121
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>yet to be determined since many
more are missing amid the rubble.</i>

122
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,178
<i>Authorities have called in troops
for rescue operations...</i>

123
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,348
<i>however, because the area
is already getting dark...</i>

124
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,351
Thanks for all the work over the years.

125
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,897
Bye bye, Mima the pop idol.

126
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,533
"Sing for us forever"...

127
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,369
I really can't do that.

128
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:14,799
"I always like looking into Mima's Room.
I've put up a link to Mima's Room."

129
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,384
What is this?

130
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,318
- Hello?
<i>- Mima! You're home!</i>

131
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,903
Mom!

132
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,199
Yeah, I'm fine! How are you?

133
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,369
Really?

134
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,457
Yeah. Today was the last one.
No more singing for me.

135
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,460
<i>I remember when you kept saying
you wanted to be a singer.</i>

136
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,588
This is my big chance!
I told you that already!

137
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,050
<i>Lately, we've all been looking
forward to each new single!</i>

138
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,638
<i>Your uncle over in Yamaguchi
buys 20 copies every time!</i>

139
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,974
You just don't understand
this industry, Mom.

140
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,602
<i>Wasn't singing what you were best at?</i>

141
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,438
The pop idol image is suffocating me!

142
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,233
Besides, nowadays pop idols are...

143
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,362
Wait, I've got a call on the other line...

144
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,906
Yes, Kirigoe here...

145
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,989
Hello?

146
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,286
Hello?

147
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,418
Mom? Just a wrong number.

148
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,463
Yeah, I know.

149
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh, wait! The bath!

150
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,543
Call me back in five minutes.

151
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,475
Oh, Mother!

152
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,981
A fax? Who's it from?

153
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:03,491
<i>Traitor traitor traltor
TRAiTor TrAltoR TralTor</i>

154
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,508
Who are you?

155
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,428
"Who are you?"

156
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,888
"Who are you?"

157
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,491
Do you know what that note means, Rumi?

158
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,042
It's an Internet home page.

159
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,086
Oh, that thing that's been popular lately!

160
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,839
And what is it?

161
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,091
How can I describe it?

162
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,594
It's kind of like computer networks.

163
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,762
And?

164
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,931
Considering that this person
"put up a link to Mima's Room"...

165
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,186
this "Mima's Room" thing
is the title of a web site.

166
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,520
You don't get it, do you?

167
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,980
Nope. Not one bit.

168
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,315
All right!

169
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,025
Sorry to keep you waiting.

170
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,944
We're ready for the take!

171
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,161
Don't make me laugh!

172
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,705
You're laughing on your own!

173
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,040
5 seconds!

174
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,542
4, 3, 2...

175
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,589
The younger sister of Rika,
the murder victim, is here.

176
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,840
Would you like to see her?

177
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,425
Mr. Yamashiro.

178
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:52,266
Do you know why the culprit peels
off the skin of his victims?

179
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,813
I assume he gets sexual stimulation
from such activities...

180
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,733
- He wants to become one.
- Become... what?

181
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,028
A woman... or...

182
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,115
CUT!

183
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,452
Eri Ochiai is a great actress after all!

184
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,997
She's a completely different person
when the camera is rolling!

185
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,332
That's good!

186
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,127
NEXT! Scene 32!

187
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,380
Rika's sister, you're on!

188
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,132
Here!

189
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,426
Hold this!

190
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,093
Nervous?

191
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,387
A bit.

192
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,769
Not much to get nervous about
when you have only one line...

193
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,566
How's our star actress?

194
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,527
Mr. Tadokoro. She's just going on now.

195
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,074
"Who are you?"

196
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,743
"Who are you?"

197
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,826
"Who..."

198
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,501
That's what I mean!

199
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,859
Good morning!

200
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,277
Morning!

201
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,612
Good morning.

202
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,990
Hello, everyone.

203
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,533
Good morning.

204
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,327
Mr. Shibuya! You're here too?

205
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,913
Hi, Eri. How's it going?

206
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,542
Sir, your lines are too hard!
I don't want to do it anymore!

207
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,795
Don't say that!

208
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,424
But the story is really good!!
I love stuff like this!

209
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,926
You're good at egging people on!

210
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,806
Eri. There were this many fan
letters sent to the station!

211
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,849
Thank you, Mr. Tejima.

212
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,643
Kuro...

213
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,646
Oh, this one's not for you.

214
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,274
Well, keep up the good work.

215
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,152
So, Sir, tell me!

216
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,154
Who's the criminal?

217
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,949
Sorry, can't tell you.
That'd spoil the fun.

218
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,703
So what ARE you going to
do about the criminal?

219
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,707
You're gonna have to
make your mind up soon.

220
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,879
Good morning, Mr. Tejima! Mr. Shibuya!

221
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,339
Oh, hello there...

222
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,677
Mima's getting good reviews.
Even among station staff.

223
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,306
If that's the case, don't you think
she's got too few lines?

224
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,268
So he says, Shibuya.

225
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,311
Hey, don't look at me!

226
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:47,316
Sir! Please! Make use of
Mima just a little bit more!

227
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,195
But see... She's a pop idol, right?

228
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,613
They're really hard to use...

229
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,075
That's no problem!
She's done with being a pop idol!

230
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,368
Really?

231
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,913
We want to give her a
drastic image change, too.

232
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,124
We're ready for the take!

233
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,211
Oh, this is for Mima.

234
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,216
"Who are you?"

235
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,551
"Who are you?"

236
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,261
5 seconds!

237
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,389
4, 3, 2...

238
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,314
Mr. Tadokoro!?

239
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,317
Mr. Tadokoro!

240
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,070
Mr. Tadokoro!!

241
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,326
I'm all right...

242
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,203
What the hell is this!?

243
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,623
I think that letter just exploded!?

244
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,625
Call an ambulance! An ambulance!

245
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,293
Yes!

246
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,339
<i>Is a warning.
The next one will be REAL.</i>

247
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,950
We're all set now.

248
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,369
Rumi, you're really amazing!

249
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:25,247
I'll sign you up for online services now.

250
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,291
Okay.

251
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,794
What do you think, Rumi?

252
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,003
About what?

253
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,130
About that thing the other day.

254
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,550
Oh, that...

255
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,011
Credit card number...

256
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,807
Shouldn't we have called the police?

257
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,644
Mr. Tadokoro said not to.
We can't do anything about it.

258
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,481
But it was a crime!

259
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,651
And it might have been me!

260
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,488
It's okay. It was just a prank.

261
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,991
Fortunately,
Mr. Tadokoro wasn't badly hurt.

262
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,369
So you shouldn't worry, Mima.

263
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,664
Anyway, Mima, I'll explain all
of this so listen carefully.

264
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,999
Okay!

265
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,669
This is a browser for the World Wide Web.

266
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,963
You launch it by double-clicking here.

267
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,090
Wha? Double-clip?

268
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,758
What are you going to do with a clip?

269
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,176
But...

270
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,305
See, next to "location" you enter the URL.

271
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,224
It's not hard, is it?

272
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,184
Come on, Rumi!

273
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,021
Can't you explain it to me in Japanese?

274
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,566
Boy! Why did you buy a computer when
you don't know anything about it?

275
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,485
Because they said it was easy!

276
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,488
Oh, all right. I'll explain it from
the beginning once more...

277
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,532
Okay!

278
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,543
H... T... T... P...

279
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,549
Ooh, something came up!

280
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,053
Hey, I'm doing pretty well!

281
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,722
And now...

282
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,515
There it is!

283
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,559
<i>Mima's Room</i>

284
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,896
<i>Mima's Room</i>

285
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>Mima's Diary</i>

286
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,066
<i>Mima's Diary</i> What's this?

287
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,484
"It was just terrible!"

288
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,111
"I screwed up the choreography,
AND forgot my lyrics."

289
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,781
"I feel so sorry to all my fans!"

290
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,784
"This morning, when I got off
the train left foot first..."

291
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,036
"was when all the bad stuff started."

292
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,705
"I always make it a point
that my right foot..."

293
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,916
"goes first into the
train and into the bath."

294
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,211
Someone sure knows me! What's this?

295
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,422
"Today was my 21st birthday."

296
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:44,762
"Yukiko, Rei, and the staff at the agency
held a party for me. It was terrific!"

297
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,557
"Coming home, I went grocery
shopping at the usual store."

298
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,559
"I got mineral water and milk."

299
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,354
"The milk just has to be Cow Brand milk."

300
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,023
"I have to allow myself at
least this much luxury."

301
00:21:56,107 --> 00:22:00,277
"And food for my precious
fish, of course..."

302
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:06,367
"May 12th. I was impressed with Eri
Ochiai's performance in Double Bind."

303
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,245
"She's another person when
the camera is rolling..."

304
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,538
What is all this?

305
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,706
How do they know this much?

306
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,292
<i>Who are you?</i>

307
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,003
<i>Who are you?</i>

308
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,881
<i>Who are you?</i>

309
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,425
<i>Who are you?</i>

310
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:28,848
<i>Who are you?</i>

311
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,310
Who are you?

312
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,897
I'm Dr. Toko Asamiya,
specializing in psychiatry.

313
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,818
I was your late sister's psychiatrist.

314
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,028
There are some things
I'd like to ask you.

315
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,114
Detective Yamashiro! Another one!

316
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,282
What!?

317
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,763
<i>This is the fifth victim...</i>

318
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,226
Just three shots.

319
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,316
Is this work really worth leaving CHAM for?

320
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,235
Rumi. Do you know how hard
it is to get a character...

321
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,197
that reappears in a drama series?
Even a role like this?

322
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,241
Yes, I do. But...

323
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,874
This is where Mima proves if she can
be seen as a real actress or not.

324
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,544
But we should sell Mima as a pop idol!

325
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:45,507
Really. Times are different from when
Rumi Hidaka was a working pop idol.

326
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,967
I know that.

327
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,137
Nowadays, there are no places for
pop idols to appeal to the masses.

328
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,641
This is the branch point that will
decide if Mima lasts or not.

329
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:56,018
Well, excuse me for not surviving.

330
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,811
Please, Rumi!

331
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:02,524
There's nothing better than having Mima
be able to change into an actress!

332
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,569
She came to Tokyo to sing...

333
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,613
Think!

334
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:11,575
On record sales we make
practically nothing!

335
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,331
But I do wish that they'd
use her a little bit more...

336
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,042
Sorry we're not that profitable!

337
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,544
Good morning!

338
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,714
How's the new CHAM going?

339
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,933
<i>Double Bind</i>

340
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,195
It's the pits!

341
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,906
Double Bind... yeah, I saw it too.

342
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,616
It was so boring!

343
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,162
Why do all psycho-thrillers made
in Japan turn out that way?

344
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,498
Mimarin's not in it!

345
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,501
Oh yeah. How many scenes was
she in last week? Four?

346
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,795
Three.

347
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,257
Somebody save Mimarin! PLEASE!

348
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:15,306
<i>A HOME PAGE ON THE INTERNET:
You can make one too!</i>

349
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,144
This morning, when I got off
the train left foot first...

350
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,077
Hey, It's Mimarin!

351
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,869
Good morning!

00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,496
Good morning, Mimarin!

353
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,806
Break a leg with that drama series!

354
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,791
Hey, wait, Mimarin...

355
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,505
Do they get all unfriendly when
they become actresses?

356
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,432
<i>Hit-And-Run at Shinkaido.</i>

357
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,977
<i>Tadashi Doi (18), in critical condition.</i>

358
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,409
Good morning!

359
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,701
Good morning, Mima.

360
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,662
Cheers!

361
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,997
Cheers!

362
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,544
What's going on?

363
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,629
CHAM's new single...

364
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,134
Oh, wow! They got 83rd?

365
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,095
We never even made the charts before.

366
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,178
One, two...

367
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,560
Congratulations!

368
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,229
We did it!

369
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,273
Now we've got to work together really hard!

370
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,192
But will there be anyone in the audience?

371
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,778
Sure there will be, Mima!

372
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,075
Your next script.
It has a few more lines.

373
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,452
Yeah.

374
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,996
You've both done great!

375
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,499
CHAM is totally okay being a duo!

376
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,186
Hey, you. Are you currently
in any talent agency?

377
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,354
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

378
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,149
Hey!

379
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,943
Wouldn't you be interested
in being a model?

380
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,237
Model?

381
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,406
Cut!

382
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,625
OK! We're going to move for the next scene!

383
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,505
Who's that girl?

384
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,090
I don't know.

385
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,093
Hey, hey, hey!

386
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,306
I saw next week's script, Shibuya.
You're wonderful!

387
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,601
<i>I didn't think it would come to this!</i>

388
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,103
To tell the truth,
I have an even more drastic idea.

389
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,522
<i>Fantastic!</i>

390
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,232
But...

391
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,485
I wonder if it would be
all right for Mima...

392
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,946
or rather, her agency.

393
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,164
Mima's character,
Yoko Takakura, changes...

394
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:13,168
personalities completely when she's
raped by the customers at a strip show.

395
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,338
You're crazy! A rape scene!?

396
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,234
She's the key figure in the second half
of the series! It's an important role!

397
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,969
But Mima's a pop idol!

398
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,388
Don't worry, Mima.

399
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,391
We'll ask the producer and get it changed.

400
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,560
Hey, hey. Wait a minute!

401
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:33,105
The scripts are already behind schedule
as is, and the art staff is getting antsy!

402
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,608
How will it look if we
make it worse by arguing?

403
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,612
I even told Shibuya that she was
changing out from a pop idol!

404
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,574
It's our job to protect the
celebrities in our agency!

405
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,034
There's no way Mima can do such a thing!

406
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,744
It's all right, Rumi.

407
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,955
I'll do it.

408
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,165
Because I decided that
I WILL become an actress.

409
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:52,874
Mima!

410
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,252
I see. You're really wonderful, Mima!

411
00:29:55,294 --> 00:30:00,257
This kind of thing is commonplace for
actresses! Jodie whatshername did it too!

412
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,759
Mima, please think it out.

413
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,821
Do you realize what will
happen as a result of this?

414
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,432
It's not as if I'm really getting raped!

415
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,893
Although... I'm sure my parents will
flip when they see me like that.

416
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,566
Anyway, I'll do it.
I'll give it my best shot.

417
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,569
Mima...

418
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,460
<i>I absolutely REFUSE to do it!</i>

419
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,607
Well, Mr. Director?
How does the set look?

420
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,942
I'd prefer to shoot in a real club...

421
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,655
but considering what we're filming,
nobody will let us shoot at their place.

422
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,406
Sheesh!

423
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,409
Please, I'm counting on you.

424
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,246
Hey, hey, hey, come on, Yada!

425
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,416
What are you going to do with just
the DATE of the next meeting!?

426
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,045
That doesn't make for much of a meeting!

427
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,421
<i>OK here!</i>

428
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,890
We're ready to shoot!

429
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:36,937
Scene 48, "The manager gets
dragged down", take 1!

430
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,940
Ten seconds...

431
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,196
5, 4, 3, 2...

432
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,303
Mmmm! Looks good!

433
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,265
Ex-pop idols sure make a nice scene!

434
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,351
<i>No! Stop! Let me go!</i>

435
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,311
<i>Cut it off! Get off the stage!</i>

436
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,479
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

437
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,040
<i>Get out of here! I'll call the police!</i>

438
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,417
<i>You think I give a shit about cops?</i>

439
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,150
<i>Stop!</i>

440
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,484
<i>Hands off!</i>

441
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,278
<i>Stop it!</i>

442
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,326
Let me go! Stop it!

443
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,538
Help! Help me! No!

444
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,008
Please! NO!

445
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,552
Cut!

446
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,557
Hey, over there, hold your places!

447
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:04,065
OK! Now move the cameras!

448
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,944
I'm so sorry...

449
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,571
Oh, no, it's all right.

450
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,115
OK, next up, the rape scene!

451
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,159
Everyone, get ready!

452
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,912
Take 1! Rolling!

453
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:22,417
No! Stop! No! No! Stop!

454
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,472
Please! Stop!

455
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,598
Cut!

456
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,601
No, no, no! FASTER!

457
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,645
Sorry!

458
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,730
Once again, from the top!

459
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:47,108
No break yet! Take 2!

460
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,325
Please! Stop!

461
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,744
No! Please! NO!

462
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,121
Stop it! No!

463
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,387
Please!

464
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:03,226
Mimarin!!

465
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm so tired!

466
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,631
Hey, where's Rumi?

467
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,761
Hmm? Oh, she had a
meeting to go to for me...

468
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,388
Hey, Mima...

469
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,641
You know...

470
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,105
Nothing. You tried so hard...

471
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,167
As a reward for your efforts,
I'll treat you to a delicious meal.

472
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,192
Lucky me!

473
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,050
I'm home, fishies!

474
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,719
I wonder if you're hungry yet?

475
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,021
Of course I didn't want to do it!

476
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,940
But I couldn't trouble all the people
who brought me this far!!

477
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,987
<i>See, didn't I tell you?</i>

478
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,532
<i>Is that the job that what you wanted?</i>

479
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,326
<i>That was the PITS!</i>

480
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,260
<i>I don't want to do that drama anymore!</i>

481
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,389
<i>The producer is a total pervert, and
my role is really screwed up!</i>

482
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:51,019
<i>Singing in front of my fans has
GOT to be the best for me after all!</i>

483
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,115
Oh... that scene?

484
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,827
Of course I would be lying if I said
I didn't have any hesitations...

485
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:12,791
but I looked at it as a hurdle
I had to jump over as an actress.

486
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,752
I heard the ratings went up.

487
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,756
As always,
the public at large are all idiots.

488
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,926
Yes. I'd like to be
recognized as an actress.

489
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,594
Not as "the ex-pop idol"?

490
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,720
You got it!

491
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,265
I was fine coz Rei was
always the one I liked.

492
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,268
I'm sure all the Mimarin fans
are crying right about now.

493
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:38,608
But CHAM did teach me a lot. It was
a great experience in its own way.

494
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,818
Yeah, totally!

495
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,571
They're probably whining,
"That's not Mimarin!"

496
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:58,670
<i>Mima's Room</i>

497
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,715
What was YOUR day like?

498
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,694
"Today, I was still a little depressed..."

499
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,264
"but receiving e-mail from all of
you made me feel a little better."

500
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,765
E-mail?

501
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:14,144
"June 24: Help me, everyone..."

502
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:20,567
"Everyone is forcing me to do it!
It's all the screenwriter's fault!"

503
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,002
<i>Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!</i>

504
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,488
This... This isn't true!
I'm not writing any of this!

505
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,242
<i>Of course!
The REAL Mima is writing this!</i>

506
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,248
<i>I know that deep down in your heart
you want to be a pop idol again.</i>

507
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,331
No!

508
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,293
I'm no longer...

509
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,378
<i>No longer what?</i>

510
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,840
<i>Oh, yeah, you're no longer a pop idol.</i>

511
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,926
<i>You're a filthy woman now.</i>

512
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,638
<i>Nobody likes idols with
tarnished reputations!</i>

513
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,557
That's not true! That's not true!

514
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,310
Mimarin!

515
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,818
<i>You can't step back into
that spotlight now...</i>

516
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,656
<i>But that's all right. I'M here.</i>

517
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:14,662
<i>From now on, I'll be in the light,
and you'll be in the shadows.</i>

518
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,041
What are you saying!?

519
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,168
Who in the world are you!?

520
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,545
<i>Nobody likes you anymore.</i>

521
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,881
<i>You're tarnished! FILTHY!</i>

522
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,883
Stop! Stop it!

523
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,802
I am not tarnished!

524
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,429
Wait!

525
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,514
WAIT!

526
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:20,144
Love makes your heart race.

527
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,398
If it means you're loved in the end...

528
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,567
be much more aggressive...

529
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,946
because you will get a chance.

530
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:35,618
The angel of love smiles at you.

531
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,204
Is anyone there?

532
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,508
Can you see the angel's white wings?

533
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,971
Or her eyes gazing at you...

534
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,100
her sweet voice, her gentle hands?

535
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,479
She is here just for you.

536
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,859
She is protecting you...

537
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,946
from somewhere nearby.

538
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,617

542
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,666
It happened about
1 o'clock this morning.

543
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,587
Hey, I called you last
night and you weren't in...

544
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,633
"Oh shit! How did you know?"
Yeah, right.

545
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,718
Did you see "Mima's Room"?

546
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,388
Yeah, but is that really her?

547
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,098
No clue.

548
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,934
According to that page,
Mimarin's gonna be on stage today.

549
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,477

It sure is a shocking incident, but

553
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,842
We have to put our minds on something else.

554

But there was that letter bomb too...

555
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,207
You think Mr. Shibuya's murder
is connected with that?

556
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,002
I didn't say that...

557
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:54,549
You watch too many TV tabloid shows.
Don't worry about it.

567
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,757
So what?

568
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,010
She's got that part down pat!

569
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,846
I'm sure she's totally showing it
off in front of the photographer!

570
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,389
Like, TOTALLY!

571
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,933

572
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,269
Yes'm.

573
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,612

a second ago is the
same person you are now?

A continuous stream of memories.

634
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,312
Given only that, we all create
illusions within ourselves...

635
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,857
saying that we each have
only one fixed persona.

636
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,526
Doctor, I'm scared...

637
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,197

that I don't know about...

638
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:56,702
It's all right. There is no way

You've matured quite a bit, Mima!

675
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,230
But it's good that people
seem to like the new Mima.

676

677

Has someone been harassing you?

I've been visiting that home page.

680
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,499
It's a bit much, even if it's a complaint
about how you changed your image...

681
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,419
It's better if you didn't look at it.

682
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,920
Yeah...

683
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,423
But maybe she is more like me than myself.

684

Mima?

685

My other self that I buried
deep within my heart.

686

What if...

687
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:47,016
What if that other personality suddenly
started acting on its own?

688
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:51,145

announced a "New Citizen's Life Index"...</i>

700
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,735
<i>that indicates the overall
Japanese standard of living and...</i>

701
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,740
It's been a while, Rumi.

702
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:48,243
What? I was here yesterday, too!

703
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,207
Yesterday? Was that real?

704
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,419
You're weird, Mima.

705
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,255
Mima! What's wrong with you!?

706
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,925
You're bleeding!

707
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,931
This blood is real, isn't it?

708
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,766
Mima!

709
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,041
Today I went shopping in Harajuku.
I'm a sucker for sale items.

710
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,032
I guess... I went to Harajuku today...

711
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,208
You mean...

712
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,628
the murderer is an illusion she created?

713
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,711
Yes.

714
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,841
She fears an imaginary security guard...

715
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:48,595
and then doubles that figure with
the serial murderer of top models.

716
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,640
But illusions don't kill.

717
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,937
But... what if that illusion found
someone to possess?

718
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,480
Possess??

719
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,858
<i>Then... all those men who got murdered?</i>

720
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,653
<i>Were those who were no
longer of any use to her.</i>

721
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,407
<i>Find her quickly, Mr. Yamashiro.</i>

722
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,119
<i>Before another victim falls prey.</i>

723
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,000
How much?

724
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,174
You sure are a weird pizza man.

725
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,462
Stop! Please stop!

726
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:19,394
Yeah, that looks good... Come on,
be more daring! More passionate!

727
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:33,867
All right! Take three!

728
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:52,761
- Hello?
<i>- Mima?</i>

729
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,305
Are you all right over there?

730
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,599
You haven't heard yet... about Mr. Murano?

731
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,603
Can't be!

732
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,899
<i>Police say that Murano died
of multiple stab wounds...</i>

733
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,818
Mr. Murano!? Really!?

734
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,113
We're going crazy here!

735
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:14,950
Anyway, stay put until
I get there. All right!?

736
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,453
<i>The weapon used in the latest murder
is said to closely resemble...</i>

737
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:22,165
<i>the one used in last week's killing
of a popular screenwriter.</i>

738
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:26,044
<i>Police are considering a personal
grudge as the motive...</i>

739
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:30,132
<i>and are looking into connections
between the two cases.</i>

740
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:04,833
Miss Kirigoe! Please, can we get your
opinion about the murder of Mr. Murano?

741
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,543
Do you know anything?

742
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:10,422
Isn't there a connection with the killing
of Mr. Shibuya the screenwriter?

743
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,425
Miss Kirigoe!
There are rumors of a love triangle...

744
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,511
between you, Mr. Shibuya,
and Mr. Murano and we...

745
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,977
You think she's jinxed?

746
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,229
What happens twice happens thrice.

747
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,106
Let's take bets on who's next.

748
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,649
Cut it out!

749
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,569
Don't mind them.

750
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,530
Am I alive?

751
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:42,037
Maybe that truck hit me...
and this is all a dream...

752
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,456
Everyone ready?

753
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,917
OK. Mima!

754
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,842
Breathe harder than during rehearsal.

755
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,095
You've just killed someone.

756
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,930
Yes.

757
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,860
And... action!

758
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,122
Are you awake?

759
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,126
You are?

760
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,711
Can you tell me your name?

761
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,590
Me? I'm Mima Kirigoe.

762
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,551
Okay. And what do you do?

763
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,721
I'm a pop idol... no, an actress.

764
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,516
<i>That must be hard work.</i>

765
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,186
<i>It's hard, but it's what I chose to do.</i>

766
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:53,525
She thinks she's a new young
actress named Mima Kirigoe.

767
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,116
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

768
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,077
In other words,
"multiple personality syndrome."

769
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:09,082
All those crimes took place when
she was some other persona.

770
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:12,419
So where's the persona
of the original Yoko?

771
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,046
Yoko Takakura, the original persona...

772
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:19,426
is nothing more than a character
in a drama for her.

773
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,681
Being a "normal" girl... how she
was raped in a strip club...

774
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,267
Everything happened as
part of her drama series.

775
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,896
By doing so, she salvaged her heart.

776
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,068
That's right. I'm an actress.

777
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,779
Cut!

778
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,242
<i>Can you tell me your name?</i>

779
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,662
<i>Me? I'm Rika Takakura.</i>

780
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:52,083
The original persona,
Yoko Takakura, no longer exists.

781
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:58,256
By killing, and later becoming, her sister
the top-model, she salvaged her heart.

782
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,596
That's right. I'm a model.

783
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,849
All right! That's the take!

784
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,319
We did it, Mima!

785
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,864
Mima... Good work!

786
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,783
I can tell you tried so hard!

787
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,201
Rumi...

788
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:30,747
As of this moment,
Double Bind is in the can!

789
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,208
Everyone, great job!

790
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,229
You were fantastic, Mima!
What do you think, Director?

791
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,523
She really was excellent.

792
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,233
Thanks a lot.

793
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,859
See you at the wrap-up party.

794
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,071
We'll be talking to you.

795
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,906
Then... shall we go as well?

796
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,367
Mima, go get changed.

797
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,550
Dr. Touko...

798
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,846
Hey now! I'm not Touko anymore!
Did you forget?

799
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:32,309
"There is no way illusions
can come to life."

800
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,853
You should stop dreaming soon.

801
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,949
Eri?

802
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,580
What's taking Mima so long?

803
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:57,792
I'm going back to the office.
Take Mima home, will ya?

804
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:01,463
Mr. Tadokoro. You were saying something
about Mima's next job?

805
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,466
Oh, it's great!

806
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,134
A starring role in a video movie.

807
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:10,597
There are a few sketchy scenes...
but what can you do?

808
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,770
Somebody help me!

809
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:22,108
Like anyone can hear
YOUR voice right now!

810
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,487
Who are you!?

811
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,863
Why are you doing this!?

812
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,699
I'm protecting my dear Mimarin!

813
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:32,118
But-But I'm Mima!

814
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,997
No, no, no, no, NO!

815
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,833
You didn't know I was Me-mania!

816
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,295
You're just PRETENDING to be Mimarin!

817
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,421
STOP!

818
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,882
NO! STOP!

819
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:54,015
Did you fool that screenwriter and that
photographer with this little mouth?

820
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,643
You tarnished Mimarin's name!

821
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,814
Can it be... that you...

822
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,526
The real Mimarin e-mails me every day!

823
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,569
And she says that you
keep getting in her way!

824
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,488
You killed them!?

825
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,699
And you'll die soon, too!

826
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,047
Bad girl!

827
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,426
You have to follow the script!

828
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,431
And now... TAKE 2!

829
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,487
All right! Looks good!!

830
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,535
You're the best, Mima!

831
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,720
Mima!

832
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,682
What's wrong? You're in shambles!

833
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:43,601
I was looking all over for you!

834
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:44,477
Rumi...

835
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,021
What in the world happened?

836
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,118
This can't be!!

837
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:04,038
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

838
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,135
Are you all right?

839
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,889
I'm taking you back... to Mima's room.

840
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,661
Rumi, are you here?

841
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,079
What?

842
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:47,707
Oh, nothing...

843
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,711
Oh, that's right,
I have to call Mr. Tadokoro.

844
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:56,192
No... This isn't my room...

845
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:59,779
<i>Of course not! This is Mima's room!</i>

846
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,532
You're!

847
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,868
Look! It's the new costume!

848
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,997
I'm wearing it at tomorrow's show!

849
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,500
Isn't it great? It's perfect on me!

850
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,879
Rumi? Why?

851
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,675
Rumi?

852
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,344
Rumi...

853
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,722
Oh! Rumi went home.

854
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,141
She said she's been busy lately
and was deprived of sleep.

855
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,685
Don't say weird stuff like that!

856
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,311
This is a joke, isn't it, Rumi!?

857
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:35,690
Love makes your heart race.

858
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:39,694
If it means you're loved in the end...

859
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,738
What do you think? Perfect, huh?

860
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,657
A pop idol HAS to sing, after all!

861
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,117
But...

862
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,327
You just had to keep getting in my way.

863
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,663
Rumi was totally furious, too.

864
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,541
Please... stop all of this!

865
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:57,837
But a pop idol is always
protected by her fans!

866
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,090
They listen to any favor
I, Mima, ask them!

867
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,761
Although Mr. Me-mania failed a wee bit...

868
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:08,598
Me-mania?
How do you know him!?

869
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:14,103
But, oh, well..." you reap what you
sow," especially about YOU.

870
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,875
Help! Somebody help me!

871
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,723
Please! Rumi, it's you, isn't it!?

872
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,224
PLEASE WAKE UP!

873
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:18,227
YOU'RE the one who needs to wake up!

874
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,570
Help, help, somebody!

875
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,032
Help! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

876
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,539
SOMEBODY! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

877
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:45,213
HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

878
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,786
Let's end all of this.

879
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,121
We don't need two Mimas!

880
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,873
I AM MIMA!

881
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,044
That's funny! Mima is a pop idol!

882
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,463
You're just a dirty old impostor!

883
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:31,425
LIKE I CARE! I AM WHO I AM!!

884
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:41,579
Oh, shit!

885
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,998
Get the police!
No, call an ambulance!

886
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,334
I know!

887
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:48,312
Thank you for the flowers you always bring.

888
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:50,189
I'll put them in my room.

889
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,818
They're pretty. Very pretty...

890
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:04,578
I didn't know you were visiting.
You must be very busy lately.

891
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,746
Oh, no.

892
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,792
Once in a while, she returns
to her Rumi persona, but...

893
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,254
I know I'll never see HER ever again.

894
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:18,759
But, thanks to her,
I am who I am today.

895
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,939
You're lying! There's no way Mima
Kirigoe would be HERE of all places!

896
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,941
I guess she was just a look-alike.

897
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,578
No, I'm real!

898
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:08,851
<i>Each time I pass this
station on the train...</i>

899
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:16,317
<i>my heart fills with nostalgia.</i>

900
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:24,400
<i>The days when I ran around town,
hiding all of my feelings...</i>

901
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:30,998
<i>in my school uniform.</i>

902
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:37,713
<i>Take me to the first time I was in love...</i>

903
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:45,796
<i>those four seasons when
I was frantic yet doubtful.</i>

904
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:52,561
<i>Remember all those times when
just being near each other...</i>

905
01:18:52,645 --> 01:19:00,645
<i>kept our love for each other growing?</i>

906
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:23,259
<i>I cut my hair after graduation.</i>

907
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:30,849
<i>I wonder if you are still the same.</i>

908
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:38,891
<i>Are you still pursuing that dream
that you kept telling me about...</i>

909
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:45,364
<i>on the way home?</i>

910
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:52,246
<i>Take me to when my tears overflowed...</i>

911
01:19:52,288 --> 01:20:00,288
<i>to those four seasons that
I felt from the bottom of my heart.</i>

912
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:07,052
<i>Remember how in the sunsets after school...</i>

913
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:15,136
<i>we just wanted time to spend alone?</i>

914
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:36,832
<i>Even in this new season, I can't shake...</i>

915
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:44,915
<i>the habit of bluffing when I am sad.</i>

916
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:51,722
<i>I'm sure that you knew.</i>

917
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:59,805
<i>I still remember your eyes when
you looked at me silently.</i>

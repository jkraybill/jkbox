1
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,834
Four, as usual?

2
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,544
Yeah, four.

3
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,837
Four it is.

4
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,589
Thanks. There you go.

5
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,592
Nothing else?

6
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,512
I got K, speed, coke, MDMA...

7
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,557
No, I'm good. I'll stick with this.

8
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,392
- You're bleeding.
- What?

9
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,643
You're bleeding.

10
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,727
Fuck!

11
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,480
What's in this?

12
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,566
I dunno, I don't cook it up.

13
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,193
- I won't be here next week.
- What?

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,529
I'm not here next week.
Tell everyone.

15
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,865
I'm going on vacation, anyway.

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,199
Where you going?

17
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,577
I dunno. My dad's surprising me.

18
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,121
Yeah? I don't like surprises.

19
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,790
See you, then.

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,626
- Can I finish this off?
- Yeah, it's on me.

21
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,464
Great.

22
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:53,883
I'm outta here.

23
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,051
- You know the way.
- Yeah, of course.

24
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,636
- See you.
- Yeah.

25
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:29,585
Hello.

26
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:33,088
<i>- Have you scored?</i>
- Not on the phone, Ana!

27
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,800
<i>Don't be so paranoid!
Do we take something to the party?</i>

28
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,552
No, I dunno.

29
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,181
A bottle of something.
But I think we're good.

30
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:45,267
<i>You gonna keep me
hanging around again?</i>

31
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,769
No, I'll be there in five.

32
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,480
<i>- Okay, I'm waiting for you.</i>
- Yeah, kiss-kiss!

33
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,037
Shit!

34
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,736
Fuck!

35
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,446
Shit!

36
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,406
Fucking shit!

37
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,585
The fucking car!

38
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,253
Shit!

39
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,551
I don't believe this!

40
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,320
Fuck!

41
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,335
What's that?

42
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,020
Calm down! What are you doing?

43
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,443
What?

44
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,780
What?

45
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,576
Calm down, calm down.

46
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,833
Can I help you? Do you need help?

47
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,585
Emergency services?

48
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,503
I'll call them.

49
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,466
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

50
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,178
- Yes, hello...
<i>- Speak slowly and clearly.</i>

51
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,514
I've found a woman by the roadside...

52
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,517
<i>- Is she hurt? Is she breathing?</i>
- She's in a bad way.

53
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,604
<i>Wait there.
We'll send an ambulance and the police.</i>

54
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,731
- What?
<i>- We'll send the police.</i>

55
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,150
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- No, no, no.

56
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,527
Okay, okay.

57
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,156
I'll drop you off.

58
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,908
What?

59
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,704
Ma'am...

60
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,875
Ma'am... what's going on?

61
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,044
Ma'am, are you okay?

62
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,345
I'll drop you off.

63
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,847
Okay? It's not far.

64
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,021
Just up here, okay?

65
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,858
Less than ten minutes.
We're almost there.

66
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,903
We're really close.
It'll be all right, okay?

67
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,407
Do you understand what I'm saying?

68
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,495
Do you speak French?

69
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,420
Did someone hurt you?

70
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,800
Where have you come from?

71
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,218
What happened?

72
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,471
Are you hurt?

73
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,058
What?

74
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,771
Stop it! Sit back down, please!

75
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,106
What are you doing?

76
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,900
What are you doing?
It's dangerous, sit down!

77
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,068
Overtake!

78
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,070
Overtake, asshole!

79
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,741
Ma'am, please sit back down.

80
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,453
Ma'am.

81
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,540
Stop it!

82
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,712
Calm down and sit down.

83
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:47,796
Sit down!

84
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,800
Be careful!

85
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,140
Calm down, please.

86
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,434
Sit down!

00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,883
I'm taking you to the hospital, okay?

94
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,637
The hospital is just...
just a bit farther.

95

<i>- Happy birthday, son.</i>

Okay? Why haven't you been answering?

157
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,639
- How did you get in?
- I dunno, it was open.

158
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,351
I'm pissed.

159
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,522
I lost the 100 euros my dad gave me
for the summer break.

160
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,984
All that cash he gave me,
I got nothing.

161
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,695
I don't know what I can do.

162
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,115
I can't pay. Can you spot me?

163
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,951
You don't mind?

164
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,039
- We'll do a line in your bedroom.
- What?

165
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,166
We'll do a line in your bedroom.

166
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,378
Yeah... No!
Wait here, I'll go get it.

167
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,797
- Why?
- No, stay here.

168
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,174
Stay here! I'll be right back.

169
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,442
Idiot!

170
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:38,363
Yeah, Ryan, a quick voice note
to tell you not to pick us up.

171
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,114
If that's okay.

172
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,992
I dunno, I think we'll walk.

173
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:01,219
Baby, if you get this,
call me back or text me.

174
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,889
We're going to walk, it's real close,
so don't come.

- No, you come here.

179
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,115
No, come here.

181
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,202
I don't have time, come here.

182
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,957
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

183
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,512
What are you doing?

184
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,931
I told you not to smoke in here.

185
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,728
What's happened?
Why are you being all weird?

186
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,396
It's nothing. There.

187
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,609
It's all wet.
Did you have a shower with it?

188
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,737
I'm staying here.

189
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,449
- No, don't.
- Yes.

190
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,659
- Don't you want to anymore?
- What?

191
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,078
- Is that why you ignored my calls?
- No.

192
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,205
Tell me. Come on!

193
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,625
Fucking leave me alone!

194
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,295
What the hell is that?

195
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:21,215
Fuck, I told them not to come!

196
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,052
Turn that off!

197
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,431
Turn that light off!

198
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,059
And stop sounding your horn!

199
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,688
Stop it, turn it off.
Turn that light off.

200
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,356
Stop sounding the horn!

201
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,067
- What's going on?
- Stop it!

202
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,610
Your neighbor's a pain.

203
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,154
Come with us, there'll be lots of pussy!

204
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,989
Don't give me your lip!

205
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,325
Don't talk like that.

206
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,119
Stop it. Turn it off, turn it off!

207
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,872
Romain, shall I call your dad?

208
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,082
It's okay, chill!

209
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,500
Stop that.

210
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,043
Guys, guys...

211
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,129
I'm coming, I'm coming.

212
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:04,550
Be quiet! I'm gonna call the cops!

213
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,720
Sir, why not come with us?
There's drink...

214
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,014
Turn it off, I'm coming.

215
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,101
He's always doing it!

216
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,460
<i>No intrusion detected.</i>

217
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,552
<i>The house alarm is now activated.</i>

218
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,194
- His other woman?
- It was his other woman.

219
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,405
Basically, it was another woman,

220
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,241
but it's like it was you.

221
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,868
They're just being pricks.

222
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,828
They need to chill out.

223
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:17,331
But actually,
she wasn't his other woman.

224
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,000
Who was she, then?

225
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,878
- Nah, she was his mom.
- She's a bitch.

226
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,963
His mom is mine!

227
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,925
Are you serious?
You're an embarrassment.

228
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,262
Take your shit and pay me.
I'm sick of it.

229
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,639
Probably next week.

230
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,350
Give me one. I gave you three.

231
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,989
Good shit.

232
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,430
Romain, you're acting weird.

233
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,602
Are you serious?

234
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,687
Is it because of last time?

235
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,898
Is it me?

236
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,071
What's wrong?

237
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,114
Yeah, we share everything.

238
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,075
No one among us gets jealous.

239
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,952
Yeah, we share.

240
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,037
No, sorry, not me.

241
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,775
Can you say something?
You're acting weird, what is it?

242
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,779
Romain!

243
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,283
Don't I turn you on anymore?

244
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,494
Tell me I'm the most beautiful girl
you've ever seen.

245
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,382
<i>Subject C39...</i>

246
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,850
<i>Contamination achieved...</i>

247
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,273
Same as usual, okay? We're buddies.

248
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,902
Whose house is this?

249
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,658
Whose house is it?

250
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,994
Where the hell are we?

251
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,996
Come on. Come with me.

252
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,379
Romain, they all wanna blow you!

253
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,256
He's being so weird. What is it?

254
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:16,886
- Everyone wants to blow him.
- Shut up! No one wants to blow him!

255
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,810
Come in the bathroom.

256
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,355
Hi, Romain!

257
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,734
Okay, bro? Happy birthday!

258
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,572
Happy birthday!

259
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,827
Hi, Romain, you okay?

260
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,547
Romain, where are you going?

261
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,723
Hey, Romain, how's it going?

262
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,185
- You wanna toke?
- Come for a swim.

263
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,479
Hey, Romain, come over here.

264
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,148
I got something to show you. Magic!

265
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,025
It'll blow your mind.

266
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,069
Look, look, look!

267
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,865
One!

268
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,075
Two!

269
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,243
Three!

270
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,225
Hey, hot guy, wanna line?

271
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,228
- No, thanks.
- A birthday shot?

272
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,688
I'll be right back.

273
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,736
- You're acting all weird.
- No, it's just that...

274
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,489
Stop it!
Are you sure you're okay?

275
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,283
- I'm good.
- You're sure?

276
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,077
- We'll be in the kitchen.
- I'm coming.

277
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,894
Fucking leave me alone!

278
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,434
What the fuck...?

279
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,778
It's always the same.

280
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,072
Like I might suffocate if I fall asleep.

281
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,490
I really gotta pee.

282
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:25,366
Pee, then.

283
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,284
- Here.
- What's that?

284
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,204
Chop it on your phone.

285
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,749
Hey, girls, what you doing?

286
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,960
- It's occupied.
- Get out!

287
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,378
They're like kids.

288
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,046
I'll watch the door.

289
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,258
- So?
- I couldn't turn the light off.

290
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,344
I'd never freaked out that bad
in my life before.

291
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,721
We gotta calm down a bit this year.

292
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,599
Says she, chopping up some lines!

293
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,143
Shit, this is all wet.

294
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,480
- Never mind, it's okay.
- We don't care.

295
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,023
That's okay.

296
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,320
- I don't know what it is.
- Okay, after you.

297
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:06,991
Wait...

298
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,416
This is lit!

299
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,797
I'm not flushing.

300
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,967
What's this? Why have you got a...

301
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,136
Juju?

302
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,680
Juju?

303
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:32,391
Juju, what are you doing?

304
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,270
What are you doing?

305
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,479
Just kidding.

306
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,772
Get outta here!

307
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,276
- Sorry.
- That's not funny.

308
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,361
- What's this?
- I'm sorry.

309
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,530
Why you got a pregnancy test?

310
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,365
That's gross.

311
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,827
- Why you got a pregnancy test?
- 'Cos I'm late.

312
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,329
But you don't fuck.

313
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,872
I <i>have</i> fucked!

314
00:31:56,081 --> 00:32:00,127
You haven't fucked anyone for a year.
Why you got a pregnancy test?

315
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,755
Or you've not been truthful
with your BFF.

316
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,632
I fucked Romain.

317
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:08,802
Cool!

318
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,095
Cool!

319
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,723
Shit, they're such kids!

320
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,891
Cut it out!

321
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,251
You asshole!

322
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,942
Wait! She's downstairs.

323
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,393
What?

324
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,729
Your eyes.

325
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,732
What about them?

326
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,114
What's wrong with my eyes?

327
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:15,846
Yeah, Dad.

328
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,307
<i>Where are you?
The alarm just went off.</i>

329
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,142
<i>You have to enter the code.</i>

330
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,853
Yes, I'm on my way now.

331
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,438
<i>Aren't you at home?</i>

332
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:28,442
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in two seconds.

333
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,651
I'm going now.

334
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,447
<i>What's moving? I can see something
on the camera on my phone.</i>

335
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,783
<i>There's someone in the house!</i>

336
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,293
Sonofabitch!

337
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,698
Let me go!

338
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,167
Get off me!

339
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,169
You okay, Julia?

340
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,421
Get off me!

341
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,041
<i>Alphasecure, good evening.</i>

342
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,668
<i>Did you request
an emergency intervention?</i>

343
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,713
No... that's why I'm calling you.

344
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,632
It's why I'm calling you!

345
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:00,010
<i>Enter your four-figure code
to deactivate the alarm.</i>

346
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,762
1324. 1324!

347
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:05,933
<i>You must enter the code yourself.
I cannot deactivate it remotely.</i>

348
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,269
<i>Are you by the panel?</i>

349
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,729
No, I'm not there.

350
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,648
<i>Sir?</i>

351
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,067
<i>Sir?</i>

352
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:21,031
<i>Unless the system is deactivated
I have to request police intervention.</i>

353
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,158
No, don't call the fucking cops!

354
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,954
<i>Sir, please be polite.
This call may be recorded.</i>

355
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,959
<i>Please enter your four-figure code.</i>

356
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,336
I'm doing it, I'm doing it now.

357
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,714
<i>I'll put you on hold
while you carry that out.</i>

358
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:42,386
<i>Alphasecure, the best remote surveillance
since 1995.</i>

359
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,597
<i>With Alphasecure,

<i>Sir, are you by the panel?</i>

364
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,530
Yes, of course,
but don't call the police.

00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:05,158

<i>Are you there, Romain?</i>

388
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,259
Yeah.

389
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,261
<i>What have they stolen?</i>

390
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,138
Nothing, everything's here.

<i>Romain.</i>

392
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:52,557
What?

393
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,184
<i>- Romain.</i>
- Yes.

394
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,499
<i>Body temperature stable

<i>Pupils extremely dilated.</i>

397
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,257
<i>I shall proceed with eye tests.</i>

398
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,807
<i>I have observed in the subject</i>

399
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,602
<i>spectacular strength
when exposed to light.</i>

400
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,606
<i>The emission of photons seems
to provoke a physiological response,</i>

401
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,692
<i>stimulating increased adrenaline production.</i>

402
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,695
<i>This response could be attributed</i>

403
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:31,156
<i>to neuroendocrine modulation.</i>

404
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,393
Fucking stop that!

405
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,270
Come on!

406
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,272
Come on, then!

407
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,113
Fuck! You sonofabitch!

408
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:10,990
Seriously?

409
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,998
Romain.

410
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,211
Why did you do that?

411
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,716
You bust his jaw, okay?

412
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:33,846
You could go to prison for this,
you left him for dead.

413
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:34,931
Where are you?

414
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:38,685
I went to your place,
there's no one there, there's no answer.

415
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:39,602
Please...

416
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:40,895
<i>Calm down!</i>

417
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,189
I'm calm.
You know you can talk to me.

418
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:44,065
<i>Where are you?</i>

419
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:47,485
I just told you!
I went to your house, Romain.

420
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:49,821
<i>Where are you?</i>

421
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,030
Romain,

422
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,408
why are you talking like that?

423
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,326
<i>Where?</i>

424
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,250
Romain, why did you do that?

425
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:07,630
Why did you sleep with her?
She's fucking pregnant!

426
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,424
She's pregnant!

427
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,351
Hello.

428
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,312
How are you?

429
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:27,066
Sorry, I got the address totally wrong.

430
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:30,528
We'll be there in seven minutes.

431
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,488
No problem.

432
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,117
Take some candy if you want.

433
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,744
Do you have water?

434
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,370
Water? Yes, of course.

435
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,000
- There.
- Thanks.

436
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,794
If there's anything you need,
just say.

437
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,468
I'm a bit cold.
Can you turn down the A/C, please?

438
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,553
I'll turn it off if you like.

439
00:50:58,473 --> 00:50:59,557
Thanks.

440
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,315
Shut up!

441
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,038
What do you want?

442
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,457
<i>Ana, where are you?</i>

443
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,960
I don't want
to talk to you right now, Julia.

444
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,504
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

445
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,631
It's not you, we'll talk tomorrow.

446
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,509
<i>I'm freaking out,
I don't know what's going on.</i>

447
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:38,930
<i>I feel bad. I'm seeing scary stuff,
scary people, everywhere.</i>

448
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,890
Why should I care?

449
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,559
<i>What is this shit?
What was it we took?</i>

450
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:46,354
It wasn't me. It was Romain.

451
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,982
<i>I'm having a really bad trip.
I gotta see you.</i>

452
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:53,486
<i>Where are you? I gotta see you, Ana.
I can't breathe.</i>

453
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:56,948
Look! I'm in a bad way too, okay?

454
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,742
I'm in a bad way too, so shut up!

455
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,870
Shut your mouth, you fucking whore!

456
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,415
Are you okay?

457
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,461
- Someone's following us.
- What does he want?

458
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,840
- I don't like it.
- He's been there for a while.

459
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,883
Just a minute, sorry.

460
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,139
- Don't get out!
- He's busting my balls!

461
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,475
What's your problem? Why...

462
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,830
What the...

463
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,763
I'm having a bad trip!

464
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,517
Chill, chill!

465
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,520
There's no one behind!

466
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,817
<i>Critical loss of pressure
in rear left tire.</i>

467
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,612
<i>Stop the vehicle as soon as possible.</i>

468
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,715
Hello.

469
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,092
Police?

470
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,095
<i>Hold the line, we will take your call.</i>

471
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:11,767
<i>You are in communication
with the Gendarmerie Nationale.</i>

472
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,228
<i>Hold the line, we will take your call.</i>

473
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,648
Pick up, please!

474
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:36,459
<i>You are in communication
with the Gendarmerie Nationale.</i>

475
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,294
Police?

476
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,617
<i>I don't wanna go home</i>

477
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:13,037
<i>I don't wanna go home all alone</i>

478
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,292
Call the police.

479
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,506
Call the police!

480
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,843
And lock that door. They're coming!

481
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,806
Give me the keys to your fucking bar.
Give me the keys!

482
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,351
Give me the keys!

483
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:38,145
I'm begging you! They're coming!

484
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,356
The keys.

485
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,837
The bathroom?

486
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:48,757
Why?

487
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,234
My poor body!

488
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,192
Romain, Julia, Romain...

489
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,196
I'm not crazy.

490
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,156
Yes, I'm crazy.

491
00:58:58,494 --> 00:58:59,828
I'm dead.

492
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,332
Mom...

493
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,502
Mom!

494
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,300
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Julia...

495
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,470
<i>I got my scooter.
These guys are everywhere.</i>

496
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:18,013
No, listen to me...

497
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,723
<i>No! You listen to me!</i>

498
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,483
<i>Ana, what was that?
What the fuck was that noise?</i>

499
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,653
<i>Ana, answer me!</i>

500
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,830
- Julia!
<i>- Ana!</i>

501
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:10,626
- Meet me by the station bridge!
<i>- What did you say?</i>

502
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,419
By the station bridge!

503
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,505
<i>Okay, I'll head to the center.</i>

504
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,465
<i>I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

505
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:18,634
<i>Ana, do you hear me?</i>

506
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,562
Stop it, no way!

507
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:40,966
<i>I don't wanna go home</i>

508
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,886
<i>I don't wanna go home all alone...</i>

509
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,944
Excuse me, can I take your bike?

510
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:05,073
What are you doing?
Leave that, it's not yours!

511
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,409
Cut it out! Let go!

512
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,004
Fuck!

513
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,551
Shit!

514
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,058
Sorry.

515
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,185
Sorry!

516
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,520
You lunatic!

517
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,938
Forgive me!

518
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,440
It's not me, it's not me!

519
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:18,897
Sorry.

520
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,748
Why? Why?

521
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,293
It's not me, it's not me.

522
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,141
Sorry.

523
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:00,522
Julia!

524
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,401
Anaïs!

525
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,785
Ana, what's happened to you?

526
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,705
What the fuck's happened to you?

527
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,044
Anaïs!

528
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:26,465
I'll get you to the hospital, okay?
I'll get you to the hospital.

529
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,508
Do you hear me?

530
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,260
Get on.

531
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37,059
Hold on tight,
I'll get you to the hospital.

532
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,154
Hold on.

533
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:51,740
Shit!

534
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,202
Anaïs, hold on!

535
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,998
You're gonna be okay. Shit!

536
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,921
What are you doing, Ana?

537
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,424
Shit, they've blocked all the roads!

538
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,259
Hold on.

539
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,972
What's wrong with you? It's all right.

540
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,273
It's okay.

541
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:27,317
How do I get through?

542
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:31,446
They've blocked all the roads!
Where do I go?

543
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,743
Stop it!

544
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,417
What are you doing?

545
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:52,300
Stop it!

546
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,560
Hold on tight!

547
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,855
Stop it, and hold on tight!

548
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:22,122
Hold on!

549
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:25,125
It's gonna be all right, okay?

550
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:39,765
Stop it!

551
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:43,018
What are you doing?
Ana, what are you doing?

552
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,521
Stop it!

553
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,524
What's wrong with you?

554
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,904
What's happened to you?

555
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:56,865
You're scaring me.

556
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:20,972
Stop it, please.

557
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,390
Look at me.

558
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:23,850
Stop, please.

559
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,978
Ana, why are you acting like that?

560
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,939
Why are you doing that?

561
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:31,691
Stop it!

562
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:37,656
Ana, I'll go get help, okay?

563
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,450
I'm sorry.

564
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,544
I'm sorry!

565
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,094
- Mom.
<i>- Something's happening in town.</i>

566
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,598
- Mom, what's wrong?
<i>- Alice has left me on my own.</i>

567
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,391
Mom, calm down.

568
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,561
I'm close to home, I'll be right there.

569
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:51,229
<i>My wheelchair's stuck.</i>

570
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,982
Mom, I know!
Sorry. I know, okay?

571
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,234
I'll be right there. I'm close to home.

572
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:58,320
<i>¡No me puedo mover!</i>

573
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,572
Julia!

574
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:03,658
Help me!

575
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:09,331
Please!

576
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:11,833
Forgive me!

577
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,627
Forgive me, Julia !

578
01:10:16,463 --> 01:10:17,964
I'm scared!

579
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:23,303
I'm gonna eat your fucking face!

580
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:40,904
Julia!

581
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:47,035
Wait for me!

582
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,933
Wait for me, Julia!

583
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,316
<i>First floor.</i>

584
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,203
<i>Door closing.</i>

585
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:46,905
<i>Stay calm, a problem has arisen.
An operator will contact you.</i>

586
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,668
What's going on?
Why have the lights gone out?

587
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,213
Is anybody there?

588
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:04,964
Victor, that you?

589
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,717
Can you hear me?
I'm stuck in the elevator!

590
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,969
Can someone see downstairs?

591
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,221
Hello!

592
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,139
Okay, I'm going down.

593
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,724
Is anybody there?

594
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,395
<i>Stay calm, a problem has arisen.

595
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,567
What are you doing here?

596
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,863
Do you know
where my friend Julia lives?

597
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,824
Get out or I'll call the cops!

598
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,036
You smell good. Can I smell you?

599
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:36,287
What?

600
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,408
No, I don't believe it!

601
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,952
It's a nightmare!

602
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:24,335
<i>Stay calm, a problem has arisen.

603
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:29,883
Is anybody there?

604
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,093
- Alice!
- Is someone in there?

605
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,346
Alice, can you hear me?
It's Julia, I'm stuck in the elevator.

606
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:37,390
Alice, have you seen Mom?

607
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:40,393
You can't stay,
you gotta go, do you hear me?

608
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,522
No, listen to me!
There's no one to help Mom!

609
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,025
Open this fucking door!

610
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:49,986
Sir?

611
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,196
Alice!

612
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,740
Sir, please help me.

613
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,201
They've killed everyone.

614
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:57,493
Please.

615
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,454
Please...

616

<i>Stay calm, a problem has arisen.

617
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:18,473
Is anyone in there?

618
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,267
I know you're there.

619
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,479
If you've been in contact
with an infected person,

620
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:27,690
turn yourself in immediately.
You're in danger.

621
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,154
We can help you, we can protect you.
Do you hear me?

622
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:35,365
Come out of the elevator.

623
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:43,498
<i>15th floor.</i>

624
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,875
<i>Door opening.</i>

625
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:26,791
Mom! Mom, I'm here!

626
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,732
You see me?

627
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,610
Here!

628
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,824
Come here!

629
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,329
Julia, Julia...

630
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:30,563
Open your mouth and you're dead.

631
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:37,779
Come here.

632
01:17:42,784 --> 01:17:44,202
Come here.

633
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,954
Turn that off, it attracts them.

634
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,834
Open your eyes wide.

635
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,669
Show me your eyes.

636
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,144
Don't make any noise.

637
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,736
Stay here.

638
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,197
Whatever you do, don't move.

639
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,127
Sir...

640
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,053
Keep your distance!

641
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:18,981
Keep your distance, I said!

642
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:27,490
Sir...

643
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:30,618
Tell me none of this is happening.

644
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,876
You have to leave.

645
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:40,878
Quick.

646
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,756
Listen to me.

647
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:45,800
Listen to me!

648
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:53,474
We have orders to kill all those
who've had direct contact.

649
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,643
Listen to me.

650
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:00,189
This life no longer exists.
Listen to me.

651
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:03,901
How do you feel?

652
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,028
Is your head spinning?

653
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:07,989
Are you hearing voices?

654
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,575
Are you drawn to the light?

655
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:14,287
If you haven't ingested
any of their blood, you're okay.

656
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:18,249
Stay in the dark.
Use as little light as possible.

657
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,167
It makes them stronger.

658
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,087
What's your name?

659
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,133
What's your name?

660
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:30,928
I'm Julia.

661
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:37,935
Julia.

662
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:51,407
In a few minutes I'll no longer
be able to control myself.

663
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,201
Julia, get away from here.

664
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:57,663
Before I hurt you.

665
01:21:57,872 --> 01:21:59,624
This is crazy shit!

666
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,917
Go.

667
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,092
I don't believe this.

668
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,470
Julia, turn around.

669
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,557
Turn around.

670
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,695
Wake up!

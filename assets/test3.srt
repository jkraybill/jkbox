Drop your weapon and step away

I called you. You specifically. Look:

You know who I am. I'm not gonna
shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.

Would you fucking shoot!

2002
02:18:01,774 --> 02:18:05,486
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

2003
02:18:05,653 --> 02:18:10,324
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!

Maybe you do.

But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

this prick to Costello, all right?

Shut up.

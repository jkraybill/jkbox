1
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,671
You little brats, beat it!

2
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,821
Hey!

3
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,988
It should have been me!

4
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,902
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

5
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,662
You'll miss the train.

6
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,861
Hurry.

7
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,587
PART ONE

8
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,588
Kouzuki Noriaki

9
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,463
Go back to sleep.

10
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,707
We're still far from the house.

11
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,701
Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.

12
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,743
This property has three buildings.

13
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,908
A Western-style wing by
an English architect

14
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,984
and a Japanese wing form the main house.

15
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,066
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles.

16
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,710
It reﬂects Master's
admiration for Japan and England.

17
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,625
Next is the annex

18
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,625
which Master had furnished as a library.

19
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,185
Last, the servants' quarters.

20
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,906
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

21
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,582
You may eat her leftover food,

22
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,942
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

23
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,621
Used soap is for the steward.

24
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,466
Anyone caught pilfering
is expelled that day.

25
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,782
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

26
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,461
Huh.

27
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,224
"Tamako" is you.
Your name Okju in Japanese.

28
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,985
We live in the Japanese style here.

29
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,901
Speak Japanese to the Master and Lady.

30
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,260
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

31
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,182
I don't trust new servants.

32
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,348
Even if they make a good impression,

33
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,664
if the house burns down, they'll
run away with a manuscript.

34
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,589
The Lady's routine is simple.

35
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,864
Taking a walk, or reading for Master.

36
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,105
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

37
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,064
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

38
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,349
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

39
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,586
In such a home,

40
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,549
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

41
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,667
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

42
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,061
I sleep in here?

43
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,864
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

44
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,791
She's behind this door?

45
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,861
Shh!

46
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,386
Mother!

47
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,985
Ah!

48
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,865
Mother!

49
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,065
Mother!

50
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,261
Miss!

51
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,428
Miss, are you all right?

52
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,784
Junko! Is that you?

53
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,141
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

54
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,786
Seems you had a bad dream.

55
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,265
You see that big cherry tree?

56
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,740
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

57
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,228
Sometimes on moonless nights,

58
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,064
my aunt's ghost

59
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,747
dangles from that branch.

60
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,109
Here, drink up.

61
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,264
When babies cry, my auntie
feeds them a spoonful of sake.

62
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,905
<i>Sweet bird, sweet bird</i>

63
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,624
<i>My sweet bluebird</i>

64
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,707
<i>What scent is this that fills my nose?</i>

65
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,943
- What?
- Coming back from the toilet,

66
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,944
I saw a light going down the hallway.

67
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,424
That's it! They're meeting in her room.

68
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,031
Or else it's the ghost
of the cherry tree?

69
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,541
Those fuckers.

70
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,750
This is Tamako.

71
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,631
I am at your service. Miss...

72
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,909
A reference letter
from Lady Minami, my last mistress.

73
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,551
So is this place to your liking?

74
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,545
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

75
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,668
Uncle won't permit it.

76
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,351
Sunlight causes books to fade.

77
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,991
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

78
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,667
Not a good liar, are you?

79
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,703
We look a bit alike.

80
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,144
Are you also an orphan?

81
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,751
- Uh...
- I'll take my leave.

82
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,590
Whereas in my case,
my aunt and Mrs. Sasaki

83
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,267
showed me how the love
of a mother...

84
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,420
isn't worth a thing.

85
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,828
My head aches
before every reading practice.

86
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,105
Would you read it to me?

87
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,227
Pardon?

88
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,351
Oh, how kind of her.

89
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,141
Lady Minami said such
nice things about me!

90
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,790
Is that so?

91
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,621
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

92
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,181
I'm sick of it.

93
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,549
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

94
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,827
So read that for me.

95
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,066
"Dear Miss lzumi Hideko,

96
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,984
"Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

97
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,541
"Maids are like

98
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,549
"a spoon..." No...

99
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,184
"Are like chopsticks..."

100
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,627
Is it a spoon?

101
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,187
I don't know how to read, Miss.

102
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,505
Not at all? What about Korean?

103
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,344
This is your name.

104
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,144
Can't you read it?

105
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,302
Reading can be learned,

106
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,101
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

107
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,860
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

108
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,590
Yes, Miss.

109
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,631
My mom.

110
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,665
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

111
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,865
And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?

112
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,701
Everyone says I can't compare to my mother.

113
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,581
Count Fujiwara said...

114
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,183
So you've met the Count?

115
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,622
Pardon?

116
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,862
No, I never met him...

117
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,389
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

118
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,861
She was his nanny.

119
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,541
What did the Count say about me?

120
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,427
He said your face...

121
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,428
Every night in bed he
thinks of your assets...

122
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,065
Your face.

123
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,311
Why in bed, I wonder?

124
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,589
What's with your foot?

125
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,510
I've nowhere to go.

126
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,624
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea at age five.

127
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,740
But in new shoes,
even well-trodden paths feel fresh.

128
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,907
The ones from here

129
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,301
up to here should fit you.

130
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,346
Why not the prettiest ones?
Like these?

131
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,988
Time for reading practice.

132
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,151
I'll go alone.

133
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,222
Miss? But rain is falling.

134
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,943
At noon, come knock on the door.

135
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,461
Promise?

136
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,105
See you at...

137
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,626
What's this?

138
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,665
My new handmaiden.

139
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,500
The snake, the snake!

140
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,705
You mustn't pass that point.

141
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,384
Be warned!

142
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,950
The snake marks the bounds of knowledge.

143
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,267
He has the habit of licking his plume
when he thinks,

144
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,462
otherwise he's someone clean.

145
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,263
What kind of servant would
hog the umbrella like you?

146
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,342
Pardon?

147
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,901
Miss!

148
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,627
Miss!

149
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,142
<i>These books make me sink.</i>

150
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,382
They bore me to death.

151
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,462
Do you read so many books?

152
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,470
You'll become a professor
in no time then.

153
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,863
I'm sorry.

154
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,910
I won't do it again.

155
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,661
Pardon.

156
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,865
The Count?

157
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,666
Today?

158
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,711
That's why you insisted on a bath.

159
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,431
My aunt, when she heard
a guest was coming,

160
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,743
dropped everything
and bathed her baby, Miss.

161
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,782
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised her baby's scent.

162
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,188
You are my baby, Miss.

163
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,390
Auntie gave the babies candy during baths.

164
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,111
To teach them that bath time is sweet.

165
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,910
What's wrong?

166
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,946
One of my teeth is sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

167
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,548
<i>So this was the scent.</i>

168
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,504
All smooth.

169
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,509
Welcome, sir!

170
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,830
You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival,

171
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,268
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

172
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,980
Now your tedium is over.

173
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,464
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

174
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,826
This must be Okju.

175
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,421
At your service, milord.

176
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,545
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

177
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,344
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

178
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,946
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

179
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,626
Thank you for your recommendation.

180
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,468
You chose a perfect servant for me.

181
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,547
You wouldn't want one who's too stupid.
I did my best.

182
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,703
Take good care of our dear Lady.

183
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,061
Take this.

184
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,470
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

185
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,141
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

186
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,869
- Did you call for me, milord?
- You may enter.

187
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,908
Do you think you can fool me with this?

188
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,550
Who do you take me for?

189
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,701
<i>You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i>

190
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,108
<i>But my real name's Nam Sookee.</i>

191
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:49,506
<i>Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i>

192
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,710
<i>I was able at age five
to tell a real coin from a fake.</i>

193
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,950
<i>Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,</i>

194
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,746
<i>and studied pickpocketing from Kutan,</i>

195
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,947
<i>but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i>

196
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,827
<i>Abandoned as newborns,</i>

197
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,268
<i>we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i>

198
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,509
<i>Such meaningful work.</i>

199
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,102
<i>Instead of starving, they grow up
gentlemen and ladies.</i>

200
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,991
<i>Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i>

201
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,947
<i>I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i>

202
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,830
Milord!

203
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,262
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

204
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,391
who bribed his way into
translating for high officials.

205
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,870
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

206
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,944
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

207
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,908
So he gets naturalized,

208
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,222
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

209
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,545
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

210
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,866
Ba... Bas...

211
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,661
Bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

212
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,346
He invites Japanese
collectors to his library,

213
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,704
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

214
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,670
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

215
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,629
but he can't help parting with a few.

216
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,267
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

217
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,229
He sells a fake.

218
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,510
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

219
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,582
Unlike him, this specialist

220
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,464
is a real Japanese, of noble birth!

221
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,469
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

222
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,062
So, who is this?

223
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,310
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

224
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,225
- You'll seduce her...
- Is she pretty?

225
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,264
The Jap wife died ages
ago with no children.

226
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,348
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

227
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,870
performs those book readings.

228
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,066
But is she pretty?

229
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,391
An orphan. Her father was rich.

230
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,351
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

231
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,543
After marrying her there,

232
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,864
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

233
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,028
and lock her up in a madhouse.

234
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,341
Right!

235
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:17,349
Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid, eavesdrop on her,

236
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,591
stay by her side and gently
persuade her to fall in love.

237
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,027
<i>Love?</i>

238
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,101
<i>What does a crook know about love?</i>

239
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,709
What of her fortune? She's rich?

240
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,191
Each night in bed
I think of her assets.

241
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,590
1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.

242
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,062
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

243
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,900
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

244
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,907
To his wife's niece?

245
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,226
What a sick...

246
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,785
Right, a sick fuck.

247
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,747
So what's our share?

248
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,144
I'll share 50,000.

249
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,228
Sookee gets the dresses and jewelry.

250
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,102
I'll do it! Take me!

251
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,582
My Japanese is better,
and I worked as a maid!

252
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,824
On top of the fifty,

253
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,825
I get dresses, jewelry and my own 100,000.

254
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,109
B- b-beautiful!

255
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,184
I'm flummoxed in your presence!

256
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,744
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

257
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,621
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

258
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,589
and then they'll open up to you, all right?

259
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,351
Watch how to make your face blush:

260
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,346
Breathe in deep and
squeeze your stomach tight,

261
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,504
lower your chin
and contract your asshole,

262
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,061
don't breath, and swallow
your saliva ten times.

263
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,507
Got it?

264
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,342
Go ahead.

265
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,743
The blue kimono
with the white peonies,

266
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,301
or the black one with
the drawings of cranes?

267
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,380
The shit-colored one with caterpillars,

268
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,827
or the caterpillar-colored one
with drawings of shit?

269
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,061
Don't ask her opinion!

270
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,780
Questions make her think.

271
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,741
You're the one who should be
thinking for her!

272
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,790
That's how you dominate your mistress,
got it?

273
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,341
Yes.

274
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,260
This is the letter. Listen closely.

275
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,183
"Dear Miss lzumi Hideko,

276
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,301
"Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

277
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,943
"Maids are like chopsticks."

278
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,264
"You hardly notice them, but their
absence plunges you into disarray."

279
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,465
Did my morn cry before they hanged her?

280
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,424
Women who steal once

281
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,587
and are hanged always cry.

282
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,629
They even cry a lot.

283
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,311
Your mother stole a thousand times,

284
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,465
was caught just once, and died once.

285
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,471
Did she cry?

286
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,669
She laughed.

287
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,706
Said she was lucky to
have you before dying.

288
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,831
That she had no regrets.

289
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,504
Imagine what a good
thief you'll become!

290
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,667
It should have been me!

291
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,267
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

292
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,862
What a pity...

293
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,982
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo.

294
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,504
How you'll be an even
greater thief than your mom. Hmm?

295
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,426
Who believes the talk of a swindler?

296
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,742
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

297
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,902
arrange for her and I to be alone.

298
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,903
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

299
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,224
She's so naive,
even if a man pulls on her nipples

300
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,631
she won't know what he wants.

301
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,022
So it's your job to tell her
that everything is because of me.

302
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,631
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

303
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,425
your toenails are growing much faster!"

304
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,867
That sort of thing, all right?

305
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,590
Here, a gift.

306
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,991
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

307
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,389
<i>That'll be mine when
she goes to the madhouse.</i>

308
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,542
<i>It pains my heart to see this poor girl.</i>

309
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,584
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

310
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,224
Let's take a look...

311
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,660
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

312
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,264
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive, too.

313
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,505
How do you know...

314
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,783
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

315
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,030
But it's fine!

316
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,664
No need to be ashamed at all.

317
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,266
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

318
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,910
Is that so?

319
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,104
<i>Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i>

320
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,107
<i>has anything been this pretty?</i>

321
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,791
<i>I'd like to show her to the people at home.</i>

322
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,021
<i>What would they say?</i>

323
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,350
<i>Probably this?</i>

324
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,501
Mesmerizing!

325
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,551
Spellbindingly beautiful!

326
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,226
<i>He's shameless.</i>

327
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,105
The Count kept pushing wine on me.

328
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,021
<i>Does it feel okay?</i>

329
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,542
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

330
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,751
You think this is suffocating?

331
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,668
Miss, you're killing me!

332
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,950
Dressed up,
you look like a lady, too.

333
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,389
I think I know

334
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,862
what the Count meant.

335
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,344
Your face...

336
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,549
Each night in bed,

337
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,708
I think of your face.

338
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,744
Don't be silly, Miss.

339
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,711
<i>Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.</i>

340
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,743
<i>All these buttons are for my amusement.</i>

341
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,385
<i>If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i>

342
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,028
<i>then, the sweet things within,</i>

343
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,551
<i>those sweet and soft things...</i>

344
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,188
<i>if I were still a pickpocket,
I'd slip my hand inside...</i>

345
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,742
Miss, are you truly
going to marry your uncle?

346
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,989
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

347
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,947
There's a famous collector in France.

348
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,348
He'll be putting his entire library
up for auction.

349
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,384
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

350
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:35,626
If it were me, I'd sell books
to buy gold, not the opposite.

351
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,829
Did you ever think of
marrying someone else?

352
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,301
- Count Fujiwara for example...
- You!

353
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,304
You're quite curious for a servant.

354
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,987
<i>For now,</i>

355
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,302
<i>the Lady needn't go read to the sick fuck
who wants to marry his wife's niece.</i>

356
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,067
<i>Instead the fake Count goes
to the library to make fake books.</i>

357
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,266
<i>The Lady waits for her 2:00 art class,</i>

358
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,745
<i>and waits...</i>

359
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,307
<i>Poor girl,</i>

360
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,190
<i>losing her heart to a fake.</i>

361
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,911
<i>Please, Count!</i>

362
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,551
Sorry to be late.

363
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,387
It's no matter.

364
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,984
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?

365
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,586
Dimensionality, perhaps.

366
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,631
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

367
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,460
As if you see directly
into an object's essence.

368
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,031
For example, the fact that this
peach contains a lot of water.

369
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,586
I hesitate to stand before you,

370
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,271
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

371
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,983
That's enough for today.

372
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,785
Almost fully ripe.

373
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,221
<i>Already?</i>

374
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,861
<i>Damn...</i>

375
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,146
Do you know what?

376
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,861
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown ﬂushed.

377
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,947
Have they?

378
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,151
How did your mom die?

379
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,466
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

380
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,471
- I mean, she hanged...
- Hanged herself? Like my aunt.

381
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,988
Well, pretty much.

382
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,029
Still, while alive she hugged you a lot?

383
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,311
My mother died giving birth to me.

384
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:22,304
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

385
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,990
I wish I'd never been born.

386
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,149
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

387
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,067
If your mother thought
you could understand,

388
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,666
this is what she'd have said.

389
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,631
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

390
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,868
That she had no regrets.

391
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,707
Wait here a moment, Miss.

392
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,707
I'll go pick mushrooms.

393
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,030
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

394
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,824
I'll go with you.

395
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,150
I'll be quick.

396
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,510
Before it rains.

397
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,747
Good girl...

398
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,951
What a coincidence.

399
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,507
Indeed.

400
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,584
May I sit by you?

401
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,590
<i>The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i>

402
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,305
<i>The gentleman is persistent.</i>

403
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,985
<i>The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i>

404
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,028
<i>All is well, Sookee.</i>

405
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,183
<i>Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i>

406
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,026
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

407
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,271
You know servants can't use this entrance!

408
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,781
Hey!

409
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,751
<i>I wish I'd never come here.</i>

410
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,622
<i>It was wrong to come.</i>

411
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,424
Tamako,
you brought watercolors, right?

412
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,943
Of course, milord!

413
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,470
Watercolor paints and brushes...

414
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,582
Go and get the oils.

415
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,227
A day like this demands oils, yes!

416
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,341
Shit!

417
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,750
Lady.

418
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,310
Milord.

419
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,705
Lady.

420
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,301
A blackout! Bring a lantern.

421
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,905
<i>I need to think.</i>

422
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,907
<i>I need to become rich,</i>

423
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,502
<i>sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,</i>

424
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,623
<i>buy my fill of glittering baubles,</i>

425
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,702
<i>and not think of Hideko.</i>

426
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,028
<i>Never think of Hideko...</i>

427
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,226
I returned
and you didn't even come to me?

428
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,904
It was late, I must have slept.
My apologies.

429
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,350
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

430
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,542
Must I remove makeup
and change clothes all by myself?

431
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,986
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

432
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,468
He proposed to me.

433
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,304
Next full moon,

434
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,142
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

435
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,462
What did you say?

436
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,983
I said I wasn't sure.

437
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,067
Why?

438
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,150
I'm scared.

439
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,783
Of your uncle's anger?

440
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,548
Of the Count.

441
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,144
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

442
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,344
I don't know, I just feel it.

443
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,789
Like the reflex of pulling
your hand from a flame.

444
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,182
Tell me...

445
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,301
What is it that men want?

446
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,701
Pardon?

447
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,740
I mean, after getting married,
at night...

448
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,230
How would I know?
I'm practically a child.

449
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,305
With no mother. No one here to...

450
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,221
First,

451
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,304
I guess they'd kiss?

452
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,506
And then?

453
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,304
They hug each other.

454
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,225
Standing up?

455
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,309
When there's no bed or
they have to be quick.

456
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,304
Normally one does it on a bed.

457
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,145
Let yourself go without thinking.
It'll work itself out.

458
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,540
Without thinking?

459
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:11,101
Are there girls who feel nothing

460
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,510
like how blind people don't see?

461
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,189
<i>What the hell.</i>

462
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,661
<i>I'll show her one thing,
then put her to bed.</i>

463
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,061
<i>Poor thing,</i>

464
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:31,949
<i>alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,</i>

465
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,191
<i>without learning a single useful skill.</i>

466
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,220
<i>Why does the candy taste different?</i>

467
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,669
<i>The bitter turned sour,</i>

468
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:03,222
<i>the sour turned sweet,</i>

469
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,782
<i>the sweet turned savory...</i>

470
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,868
How do you know all this?

471
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,948
You must have experience?

472
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,985
My friend Kutan taught me.

473
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,988
Taught you? In words?

474
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,628
Yes, only in words.

475
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,102
So this is how it feels.

476
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,791
That's what you will feel for the Count.

477
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,021
Really?

478
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,304
The Count, truly...

479
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,070
He won't think he's
making love to a corpse?

480
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,342
You know about my cold hands and feet.

481
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,181
Really?

482
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,147
Here.

483
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,389
Feels just fine.

484
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,021
You like it?

485
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,943
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

486
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,271
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

487
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,101
And then...

488
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,063
It's so cute.

489
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,822
If the Count sees this...

490
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,864
Will he really be so tender as this?

491
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,980
Of course.

492
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,069
And he'll touch you like this.

493
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,102
And like this...

494
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,070
Keep doing it like the Count would.

495
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,550
And this is what he'll say.

496
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,304
It's so soft, warm,

497
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,302
wet, and

498
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:32,263
spellbindingly beautiful!

499
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,541
<i>Okju.</i>

500
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,104
<i>Hideko.</i>

501
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,460
<i>Mommy.</i>

502
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,302
<i>Daddy.</i>

503
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,671
Now, the model must stay still.

504
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,027
Okju.

505
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,429
- Hideko...
- Wait.

506
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,106
Stop!

507
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,980
<i>Leave Hideko alone.</i>

508
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,786
Stop it!

509
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,901
I can't do this.

510
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,664
Come here, Tamako.

511
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,030
Find some other job to do.

512
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,784
You catch my meaning?

513
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,428
I've no other job to do.

514
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,748
My job is to look after the Lady.

515
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,309
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

516
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,342
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

517
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,030
If I miss this fortnight, I'm finished!

518
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,901
Can you feel it? How much I want it?

519
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,588
After fighting so hard to escape
my garbage heap of a life,

520
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,229
you think I'll let you
fuck it up, you bitch?

521
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,746
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

522
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,427
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

523
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,824
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman...

524
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:47,907
Sookee.

525
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,187
Think of your family at home.

526
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,306
Boksun raising babies with her bad back,
and those two halfwits.

527
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,951
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

528
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,943
Want to shit on your mother's legend?

529
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,221
You should go home in glory.

530
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,986
So don't push Hideko too hard.

531
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,346
She's got no one on this earth.

532
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:15,141
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

533
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,111
And please...

534
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:26,224
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

535
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,781
Oh, my.

536
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,628
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

537
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,509
How curious.

538
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,471
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

539
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,743
How many ships sail on the wide sea...

540
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,826
People leaving, people returning,

541
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,871
those saying "Farewell" or "Welcome back."

542
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,386
What's the farthest you've traveled?

543
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,030
The hill beyond the manor?

544
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:11,703
My uncle would follow me
to the ends of the Earth.

545
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,580
I've always lived like this.

546
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:23,030
I could be content here,
if you were with me.

547
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,904
We go for walks
wearing new shoes,

548
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,909
you tell me stories,

549
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,985
and you massage my feet like that.

550
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,268
You're fortunate, Miss.

551
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,631
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

552
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,628
That's rare.

553
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,265
But I'm not sure if I love him.

554
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,350
You do love him.

555
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,185
How do you know?

556
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,267
You stare out the window all day.

557
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,262
Turn in your sleep and sigh.

558
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,345
And your toenails.

559
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,462
Even if I say I don't love him,

560
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,344
if I say that I love someone else...

561
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,945
Me, who has no one on this earth...

562
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,425
Do you still want me to marry him?

563
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,982
You will love him.

564
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,311
Miss!

565
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,621
<i>In the end,</i>

566
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,870
<i>Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan, too.</i>

567
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,751
<i>The Count, after feigning
annoyance for a bit,</i>

568
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,584
<i>nodded his head.</i>

569
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,148
<i>On the day her uncle
left to visit his mine,</i>

570
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,709
<i>the Count pretended to go back
to Japan and hid nearby.</i>

571
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,904
You'll have a week of freedom,

572
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:17,068
but always remember the basement.

573
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,624
Miss!

574
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:11,951
<i>Thank you for traveling on our ferry today.</i>

575
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:17,790
<i>We will arrive at Shimonoseki at 7:30 p.m.</i>

576
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,550
Finally we're going home.

577
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,345
It's been three years...

578
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,828
To not steal...

579
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,870
To not steal...

580
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,831
To not commit adultery...

581
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,262
To not commit adultery...

582
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,829
To not lie...

583
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:04,222
To not lie...

584
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:45,980
<i>Spider web around in my waist</i>

585
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,749
<i>Strumming makes a zither sing</i>

586
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,184
<i>Thousand woes</i>

587
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:07,905
<i>Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry</i>

588
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:16,823
<i>How sorrowful my zither
My beloved zither</i>

589
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,742
Did you sleep well?

590
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,987
Excuse me.

591
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,627
Sorry.

592
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:51,103
<i>The Count paid the innkeeper to spy on us,</i>

593
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,063
<i>afraid we might run off.</i>

594
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:56,390
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

595
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,584
<i>Things are moving too slowly.</i>

596
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,829
<i>I fear Hideko might truly go mad.</i>

597
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,107
Shall we play maid, like before?

598
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:14,790
<i>From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.</i>

599
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:18,745
<i>Certifying the marriage
and converting the inheritance to cash</i>

600
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,782
<i>require much work, he says.</i>

601
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,389
How cruel can you be?

602
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,742
You plucked the ﬂower, now re-plant it.

603
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,782
What do you want?

604
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:10,865
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

605
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,788
<i>A week</i> here...

606
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,589
<i>Then finally...</i>

607
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,671
This way.

608
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,551
There are the doctors,
you know what to say!

609
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,985
Who is that person?

610
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,709
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

611
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,784
Her maiden name was lzumi Hideko.

612
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,710
And who might you be?

613
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,670
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

614
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,422
- Your name?
- My name is Tamako.

615
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,028
Then, what kind of treatment

616
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,666
do you believe your Lady requires?

617
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,503
She should be confined in a place

618
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:56,502
where no one can harm her,
and where she can do no harm.

619
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:06,027
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

620
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,588
Almost there. Good work.

621
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,709
Don't be frightened.

622
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,142
Good day, Countess.

623
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,305
Do you remember me?

624
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,226
Countess?

625
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:23,587
What is this?

626
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,824
We mean you no harm, Countess.

627
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,342
We're going to look after you.

628
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:34,465
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

629
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,307
Tell them, Your Lordship!

630
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:42,590
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.

631
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,462
It's because her nanny was Korean.

632
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,945
You scoundrel!

633
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,701
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

634
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:57,187
We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.

635
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,307
Miss!

636
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,065
My poor Lady, she's gone nutty.

637
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,701
If it's any help,

638
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,587
this is from her mother,
and she used to cherish it

639
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,307
before going mad.

640
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,065
Such a considerate maid.

641
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,149
<i>You thought Hideko a lamb.</i>

642
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,989
<i>Lamb, my arse.</i>

643
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,106
<i>I tell you, right from the start,
Miss lzumi Hideko</i>

644
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,101
<i>had always been...</i>

645
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,507
Miss!

646
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,870
<i>...a rotten bitch.</i>

647
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,819
PART TWO

648
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:56,981
PART TWO I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

649
01:13:56,982 --> 01:13:59,551
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

650
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,262
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

651
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,189
Hold out your hand.

652
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,430
Next time you feel like talking back,

653
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,382
remember the taste of this metal bead.

654
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,749
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

655
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,787
All right?

656
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,021
Please give me a light.

657
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,703
We've been ordered to save oil.

658
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,064
You little brat.

659
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,784
Speak Japanese!

660
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,747
In there is a man the size of an ogre

661
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:19,425
who can't stand the sound
of girls screaming.

662
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:23,501
If he hears you, he'll burst in
through that door after you.

663
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,469
And then?

664
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,983
He'll smother you with his giant body.

665
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,502
So you can't make a sound.

666
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,346
Aunt.

667
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,629
My, my...

668
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,183
Scaring a little girl like that.

669
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,550
And me?

670
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,350
Am I pretty too?

671
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,109
Look closely.

672
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:07,507
Everyone says I can't compare

673
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,667
to my big sister.

674
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,421
Day.

675
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,781
Night.

676
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,187
Day.

677
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,986
Night.

678
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,866
Man.

679
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,381
Woman.

680
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,187
Man.

681
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,901
Woman.

682
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,381
Eye.

683
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,741
Nose.

684
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,541
Mouth.

685
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,387
Ear.

686
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,381
Shoulder.

687
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,141
Nipple.

688
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,787
Navel.

689
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,381
Eye.

690
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,821
Nose.

691
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,387
Mouth.

692
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,101
Ear.

693
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,506
Shoulder.

694
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,187
Nipple.

695
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,581
Navel.

696
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:56,187
Penis.

697
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,901
Vagina.

698
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,062
Penis.

699
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,390
Vagina.

700
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,471
You think if you speak Korean,
I won't understand?

701
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,384
<i>I was going a bit crazy,</i>

702
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,623
<i>so I made them crazy too.</i>

703
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:03,262
<i>When Mrs. Sasaki looked as crazy as me,</i>

704
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,348
<i>life was more bearable.</i>

705
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:27,625
I know you are a bit insane.

706
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,026
It runs in your mother's family.

707
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,986
That's why I'm training you.

708
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,351
To set your mind right.

709
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:41,826
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

710
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:43,981
Um...

711
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:48,310
Established by the rational Germans,

712
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:51,787
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

713
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,267
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

714
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,950
and put lids on top.

715
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:02,349
If patients improve, they get a leash,

716
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,111
so they can crawl around like dogs.

717
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:35,541
<i>The cherry tree that came with me

01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,381
You must pause between words.

Don't read like a dog lapping at his plate!

724
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:03,350

"my brave knight."

755
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:28,261
When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,

756
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,702
what do you feel?

757
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,301
I pity the poor woman.

758
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:41,546
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

759
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,907
If you pity her so,

760
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:50,183
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

761
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:01,269
"The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then..."

762
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,709

If she could be yours for 10 minutes,

what would you give in exchange?

766
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,468
Whatever your heart desires.

767
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,749
Anything in this whole wide world.

<i>"Once the duke untied me,</i>

769
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,750

"As I felt the duke approach from behind,

773
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,746
"a rope slithered around my neck.

774
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,469
"The duke slowly tightened the rope.

775
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:22,228
"Like a drowning man grasping at straws,

776
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:26,709
"I pulled the swirling
currents of her hair.

777
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:30,426
"Then the duke spoke.

01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,670
"'The 10 minutes are almost up.'

779
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,546
"'Slowly, my dear, ' said the Duchess.

780
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,749
"'I haven't yet fully savored his pain.'

781
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:04,666

"'In this suffocating pain."'

785
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,389
Is it Sade?

786
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,141
It's Sade-esque.

787
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:08,226
Believed to be the same Japanese
man who wrote The Lizard Skin.

788
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,907
Acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

789
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,623
Poorly printed, on low-quality paper...

790
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,867
used and torn,

791
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:33,428
stained from food
and human secretions...

792
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:39,948
I have a predilection
for this kind of little cherub.

793
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:45,065
Can you imagine my joy when,

794
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:49,509
after such a journey,
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

795
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:54,069
An untouched 1st edition of Milton
wouldn't satisfy me more.

796
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,346
Yes.

797
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:02,388
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

798
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:09,748
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

799
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:13,511
but as you can see...

800
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,668
So unfortunate.

801
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:21,862
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

802
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:27,344
The author felt words alone could
not fully describe the positions,

803
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:31,107
and so included an illustration.

804
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:36,061
In that regard, before
we start the bidding...

805
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:37,621
Hideko!

806
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:40,825
Can you perform this scene?

807
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:21,544
Pain is a Garment

808
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,585
Beautiful!

809
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,028
See you again.

810
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:55,867
Yes, thank you.

811
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:00,388
Today's reading was outstanding.

812
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:02,031
Yes, thank you.

813
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:05,629
Especially the puppet!

814
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,662
You are of noble birth,

815
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:40,143
yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.

816
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:43,669
There was a time when

817
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:47,347
I dissipated my wit and skills on gambling.

818
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:51,027
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

819
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:53,068
make advances on me,

820
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,422
when I couldn't afford to
buy them a glass of Burgundy.

821
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:01,469
Do the women here advance on you?

822
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,028
I look at women's eyes.

823
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,789
Only the eyes.

824
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:09,547
They turn their gaze away,

825
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,941
but then they always look back.

826
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:15,783
It's a kind of silent dialogue.

827
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:21,181
If I were to slide under
someone's covers tonight,

828
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:25,431
only one woman here would refuse me.

829
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,181
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

830
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:32,062
Mrs. Sasaki...

831
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:35,940
Is she not your former wife?

832
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,304
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

833
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:43,910
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

834
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,465
Can I ask you a question?

835
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,950
Go ahead.

836
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,307
You went so far as to abandon your wife,

837
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:58,946
why this urge to become Japanese?

838
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:02,944
Because Korea is ugly,

839
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:06,350
and Japan is beautiful.

840
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,669
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly

841
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,788
and Korea is beautiful.

842
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:15,306
Beauty is cruel by nature.

843
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:19,265
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

844
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:25,188
Tell me about this woman
who would resist you.

845
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:32,425
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

846
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:34,349
Mrs. Sasaki...

847
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,470
If I gave her the right signal,

848
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:42,903
she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.

849
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,582
My thoughts exactly.

850
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:56,509
Then who is it?

851
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:59,510
The one who would deny you?

852
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,344
I heard you own the highest quality

853
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:08,305
antique bookmaking tools of East and West,

854
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,629
but I don't see them here.

855
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,146
<i>I'll</i> show them to you later.

856
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:16,791
This woman...

857
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,702
who is she then?

858
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:27,502
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

859
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:31,027
Indeed it was I who shifted my gaze.

860
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:38,148
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

861
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,389
Even if honored with such a visit,

862
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:46,227
I don't think I could consummate.

863
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,984
I would regret it as soon as I began.

864
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:55,106
Because her body
would be as cold as waterfowl.

865
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,863
The result of long training.

866
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:06,864
I heard you are engaged to her.

867
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:17,228
If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

868
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:21,030
Her eyes have no desire.

869
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:24,310
It means her soul is dead inside.

870
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:28,141
You should go easy on her training,

871
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:31,901
unless you enjoy making love to a corpse.

872
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:57,069
Would you like a cigarette?

873
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,231
How could a man with such refined tastes

874
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:13,430
indulge in a pleasure
as vulgar as a cigarette?

875
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,946
My particular way of possessing beauty.

876
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:15,827
Hideko, too, must have
received painting lessons?

877
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:23,390
In fact, I was too occupied teaching
her to read with correct diction.

878
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:25,781
Dear me!

879
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,301
In England, where I studied,

880
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:34,262
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,

881
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:37,663
even in the less noble families.

882
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,988
A phone call, sir.

883
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,743
At this hour?

884
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:03,868
It's the lwamura Bookstore.

885
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,501
Is that so?

886
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,862
Excuse me a moment.

887
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,783
You are mesmerizing.

888
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:22,944
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

889
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:27,304
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

890
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,190
I'm familiar with
Western conversational etiquette.

891
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,983
I do a bit of reading, you know.

892
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,827
There was no calculation in what I said.

893
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:44,991
It was a reflex, like pulling
one's hand from a ﬂame.

894
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,111
I'm no flame.

895
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:51,022
I'm cold as waterfowl, your Lordship.

896
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,988
He will return soon.

897
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:02,024
Mr. lwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

898
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,989
at my request.

899
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,388
There's an issue regarding your future
you should know.

900
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:11,028
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

901
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,182
That lwamura is a real fool.

902
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:24,261
Good night, Miss.

903
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,342
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

904
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:39,946
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.

905
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:43,308
I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.

906
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,781
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

907
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,149
I'm no nobleman.

908
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:49,745
I'm not even Japanese.

909
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:52,904
Think it was easy for a Korean
farmhand's son to reach here?

910
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:57,431
Fifteen hard years in Japan
before hearing about you.

911
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,508
Another three years to prepare.

912
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:03,468
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

913
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:06,062
All so that I could meet you.

914
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,025
To seduce and marry you,

915
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,461
to possess your father's inheritance,

916
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:13,188
and then probably to get rid of you.

917
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:16,704
But I knew as soon as I met you.

918
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:19,307
For a man to seduce you would be...

919
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:22,910
Impossible.

920
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:27,628
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

921
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,587
Most marriages are prison,
but this one will free you.

922
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,268
I'll rescue you from here,

923
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,861
take you far away,
and give you freedom.

924
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,507
Of course, we'll split the money.

925
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:45,349
Nonsense.

926
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:50,542
Marrying an old man with a black tongue
at your tender age makes sense?

927
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:52,622
I won't marry anyone.

928
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:54,464
What have you in mind?

929
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,341
Mmm.

930
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,665
That's not proper.

931
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,391
There's no beauty in that.

932
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:06,181
If you kill yourself, what of your fortune?

933
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:11,542
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to a pervert?

934
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:15,750
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

935
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,387
My uncle will find us somehow.

936
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:21,145
Then he'll take us to the basement.

937
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,306
Uncle.

938
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,181
The basement?

939
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:28,663
<i>It says here when people are hanged,</i>

940
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:33,821
their tongues stick out
and feces is expelled.

941
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,546
But that day, Aunt's mouth was shut,

942
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,588
and her bottom was clean.

943
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,988
Want to go somewhere nice?

944
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:06,825
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

945
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,823
after I caught her running away.

946
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:13,788
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

947
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,827
That day I just watched and listened.

948
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:37,547
But if I ever end up there again...

949
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:44,064
Highly concentrated opium.

950
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,387
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

951
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:49,310
Five drops will knock down a horse.

952
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,986
If you crave death within five minutes,

953
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,064
drink it all.

954
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:57,502
If you carry this, he can never
take you to the basement.

955
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:59,030
At least not alive.

956
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,663
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

957
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:04,023
It's more expensive than jewels.

958
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:20,990
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

959
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,670
If a bit dense, all the better.

960
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:26,865
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

961
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:33,822
They say that the sick are
buried alive in pits.

962
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:37,784
I want my name to be buried there.

963
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,987
I can find you a new maid,

964
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,028
but what do we do about Junko?

965
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:53,662
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

966
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:59,066
Sure, Hideko's pretty,
and you're pretty.

967
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:01,189
What? You speak Korean?

968
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:04,111
You know...

969
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:06,585
I learned it.

970
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:09,745
To speak more easily with you.

971
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:13,949
I really wanted to say this to you.

972
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:16,590
You are just mesmerizing.

973
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:17,906
Oh, my gosh!

974
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,864
You little tart!

975
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:28,862
I can't!

976
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:31,864
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

977
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:37,105
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

978
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:25,585
Oh, fucking hell!

979
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:27,581
Fucking hell?

980
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:28,900
Fucking hell...

981
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:22,705
<i>The Count sent exactly what I ordered.</i>

982
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:25,186
<i>Naive and a bit foolish.</i>

983
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:30,829
We look a bit alike.

984
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:33,544
Are you also an orphan?

985
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:38,950
Mother!

986
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,944
<i>Show Sookee your old clothes</i>

987
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:55,062
<i>or jewelry at every opportunity.</i>

988
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:59,464
<i>The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.</i>

989
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:05,348
<i>P.S. Don't worry if she reads this
letter, she's totally illiterate.</i>

990
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:07,151
Would you read it to me?

991
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:08,702
Pardon?

992
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,743
"...said you're looking for a maid.

993
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:14,266
"Maids are like

994
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,669
"a spoon..." No...

995
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:20,947
"Are like chopsticks..."

996
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,823
Is it a spoon?

997
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:27,942
Countess Fujiwara Hideko

998
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:31,945
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

999
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:37,984
What's with your foot?

1000
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,386
Who did it?

1001
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:46,391
Who took Tamako's shoe?

1002
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:55,467
Apologize before all the servants!

1003
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:01,704
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

1004
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:04,107
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

1005
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,301
Fucking hell.

1006
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:12,426
All smooth.

1007
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:20,984
You like the scent?

1008
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:23,191
Want to come in?

1009
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:24,381
Pardon?

1010
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:46,305
This must be Okju.

1011
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:49,350
At your service, milord.

1012
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:54,100
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

1013
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:02,621
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

1014
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:10,589
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

1015
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:17,425
Thank you for your recommendation.

1016
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:22,222
You chose the perfect servant for me.

1017
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:26,861
You wouldn't want one who's too stupid.
I did my best.

1018
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,147
Take good care of our dear Lady.

1019
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:32,382
Take this.

1020
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:38,185
There's no shame
in being rewarded

1021
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:42,265
for being a good companion
to the Lady.

1022
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,982
Isn't that right Ms. Hideko?

1023
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,544
No need to be ashamed at all.

1024
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:52,901
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

1025
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:55,102
Is that so?

1026
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,742
<i>Returning the earrings you loaned me.</i>

1027
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:06,309
<i>A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.</i>

1028
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,911
<i>I'm sure that Sookee will try her very best</i>

1029
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:14,708
<i>in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.</i>

1030
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:18,508
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

1031
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,909
Keep her busy until the
day of the wedding.

1032
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:24,548
Make her spend all her energy

1033
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:27,151
on making you fall in love with me.

1034
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:32,666
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

1035
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,390
Mesmerizing!

1036
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:48,101
Me?

1037
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,421
Dressed up, you look like a lady, too.

1038
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:09,709
Almost fully ripe.

1039
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:21,581
How did your mom die?

1040
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:25,747
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

1041
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,628
That she had no regrets.

1042
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:33,910
<i>Is this the companionship
they write about in books?</i>

1043
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:38,670
I'll go pick mushrooms.

1044
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:41,704
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

1045
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,146
I'll go with you.

1046
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,222
I'll be quick.

1047
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,427
What's wrong with her?
Is it her period?

1048
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:12,350
Men are disgusting.

1049
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:15,625
How can they be so single-minded?

1050
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,790
What's on my mind?

1051
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:22,301
You don't really believe
that I crave your body?

1052
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:25,181
You do!

1053
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:26,944
You read too many of those books.

1054
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,148
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

1055
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:35,026
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1056
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,860
it's your money, only that.

1057
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:41,225
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1058
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:46,069
Feels great being so rude to a noble lady.

1059
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:48,669
<i>What's with her?</i>

1060
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:53,544
<i>Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,</i>

1061
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:56,351
<i>sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?</i>

1062
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:02,149
<i>Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say...</i>

1063
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,344
I despise you.

1064
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:10,704
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

1065
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:33,381
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

1066
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,664
What woman?

1067
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:40,662
The duchess Juliette.

1068
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:44,221
Lady!

1069
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,468
Milord!

1070
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,906
Lady“.

1071
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:03,271
<i>"The lady's emotions lay deep inside.</i>

1072
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:06,464
<i>"Jinlian could not fathom their depths.</i>

1073
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:10,268
"Knowing this, Lady Sun

1074
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:14,385
"gave Jinlian four small silver balls.

1075
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:19,068
"'These are minling, or bells of passion.

1076
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,741
"'Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,

1077
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:25,943
"'and the other two in yours.

1078
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,582
"'Spread your legs apart

1079
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,226
"'and like two scissors

1080
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,547
'"trying to cut each
other, put them together.

1081
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:38,629
"'When the lips below
rub against each other,

1082
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:40,623
"'you'll hear a clear ringing sound."'

1083
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,543
<i>A blackout! Bring a lantern!</i>

1084
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,470
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1085
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:47,749
The Sound of Bells on a Windless Night

1086
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:53,625
"'When do I put this in?' Asked Jinlian.

1087
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:59,183
"'Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

1088
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:03,630
"'Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,

1089
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,424
"and kiss you?

1090
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,662
"'Does she embrace you tightly

1091
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:15,101
"'and caress your nipples?

1092
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:19,347
"'Does her secret part become slippery

1093
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:22,071
"'as she gently bites your shoulder?

1094
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:26,945
Does she press her legs between yours?

1095
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:29,871
And curl her toes?

1096
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:34,183
"'Then, put in the bells."'

1097
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:42,945
- Amazing!
- Indeed!

1098
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,021
It's so cute.

1099
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,263
If the Count sees this...

1100
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:20,270
Will he really be so tender as this?

1101
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:22,461
Of course.

1102
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:25,828
And he'll touch you like this...

1103
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:28,270
And like this...

1104
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:38,189
Tamako, keep doing it.

1105
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:41,144
Like the Count would.

1106
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:45,071
The Count...

1107
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:46,541
The Count...

1108
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:49,626
He'll go crazy over this.

1109
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:55,866
And this is what he'll say.

1110
01:58:57,620 --> 01:59:03,548
It's so soft, warm, wet, and

1111
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:11,904
spellbindingly beautiful!

1112
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:46,544
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

1113
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,708
Yes...

1114
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:51,702
Teach me everything.

1115
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:40,820
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

1116
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:57,548
Do you like it when I do this?

1117
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:00,150
Do you like me?

1118
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:04,705
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1119
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:07,706
I'll never,

1120
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:09,141
never,

1121
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:12,628
ever...

1122
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:32,340
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1123
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,583
You must be a natural.

1124
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:31,831
Stop!

1125
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:36,504
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1126
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:38,745
She's got no one on this earth.

1127
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:42,303
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

1128
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:44,105
And please...

1129
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:49,307
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

1130
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,150
You see?

1131
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:01,871
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1132
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:05,222
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1133
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:08,543
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1134
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,866
I can't do it.

1135
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:10,981
What?

1136
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:13,065
I want to quit.

1137
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:16,627
What's with you all today?

1138
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:19,311
Why then?

1139
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:24,031
I hate all of you. My mother, my aunt,
my uncle, you, and...

1140
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:28,111
And?

1141
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:30,751
I can't stand Sookee anymore either.

1142
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:32,709
You feel sorry for her?

1143
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:37,942
What is it with women?

1144
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:44,991
You know what that poor
Sookee said about your Ladyship?

1145
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:48,787
That you're too dense to get it
if someone pulls on your nipples.

1146
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:51,790
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1147
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:53,504
That you were so gullible!

1148
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:57,108
That naive servant's face...

1149
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:59,667
Yes, you will love him.

1150
02:03:59,860 --> 02:04:03,228
If I say that I love someone else...

1151
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:08,589
Me, who has no one on this earth...

1152
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:11,621
Do you still want me to marry him?

1153
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:13,221
Yes.

1154
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,906
Miss!

1155
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:51,550
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1156
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:26,702
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1157
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:47,541
Let go.

1158
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:53,229
Miss, I'm sorry!

1159
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:56,821
Let go!

1160
02:05:57,260 --> 02:05:59,228
I'm sorry, Miss!

1161
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:01,224
Don't die.

1162
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:03,224
I'm sorry.

1163
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:07,149
What are you sorry about?

1164
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:13,221
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1165
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:17,265
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1166
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:21,985
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1167
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:27,781
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1168
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:34,824
I'm worried about you.

1169
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:43,429
How do you know my name?

1170
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:46,701
You think you're tricking me?

1171
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:50,829
You're the one being tricked.

1172
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,910
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1173
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:59,584
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

1174
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:03,147
then I'd become you
and run far away, with him.

1175
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:11,427
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me, too.

1176
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:22,267
That fucking son of a bitch!

1177
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:26,350
Oh, sorry, Miss!

1178
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:31,583
<i>"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.</i>

1179
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:36,110
<i>"I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.</i>

1180
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:41,621
<i>"I decided to team up with the Lady Hideko.</i>

1181
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:45,103
<i>"As such, I'm now in need of all your help.</i>

1182
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:48,263
<i>"I'm enclosing an item as advance payment."</i>

1183
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:52,862
Always remember the basement.

1184
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:09,427
You want to go somewhere nice?

1185
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:55,391
You didn't teach me to read Japanese.

1186
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:19,589
Did that bastard draw this?

1187
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:27,141
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

1188
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:28,986
and those gentlemen?

1189
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,381
Ah!

1190
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:38,061
<i>The daughter of a legendary thief,</i>

1191
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:41,030
<i>who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses.</i>

1192
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:44,709
<i>Herself a thief, pickpocket, swindler.</i>

1193
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:48,505
<i>The savior who came to tear my life apart.</i>

1194
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:50,544
<i>My</i> Tamako.

1195
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:52,864
<i>My Sookee.</i>

1196
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,664
How cruel can you be?

1197
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:19,148
You plucked the ﬂower, now re-plant it.

1198
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:21,148
What do you want?

1199
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:24,702
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

1200
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,664
You scoundrel!

1201
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:34,146
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1202
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:36,701
Miss!

1203
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:38,906
Let go!

1204
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:42,544
Miss!

1205
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:58,586
I'm hungry-

1206
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:07,588
The first month, I ordered
a slim herringbone suit.

1207
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:08,863
The next month, I wore it to
dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1208
02:14:08,864 --> 02:14:12,059
PART THREE The next month, I wore
it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1209
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:12,151
PART THREE

1210
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:15,303
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1211
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:18,543
Some Englishmen who frequented
the brothel recognized me.

1212
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:22,221
I thought they'd call
the maitre d' and kick me out,

1213
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:24,151
but what do you know?

1214
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:29,302
They were amused I'd
spend a month's pay

1215
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:30,905
on one dignified meal.

1216
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:34,141
They started calling me Count

1217
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:36,143
and taught me manners
to go with the name.

1218
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,547
Frankly, I'm not that interested
in money itself.

1219
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:41,231
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1220
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:44,951
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1221
02:14:44,980 --> 02:14:46,345
Something like that.

1222
02:14:58,300 --> 02:15:00,826
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1223
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:03,141
is the summer home of
a genuine Russian noble family.

1224
02:15:03,142 --> 02:15:04,983
The villa is entirely furnished.

1225
02:15:04,984 --> 02:15:07,506
The carpets are very soft.

1226
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:16,584
Shall we marry there?

1227
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:23,947
<i>In a few days I'll hear from the hospital.</i>

1228
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:28,426
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko has died.

1229
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:35,103
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1230
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:39,502
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1231
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:49,989
Fuck!

1232
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,425
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

1233
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:59,500
I never pretended to be
anything but a crook, my dear!

1234
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:04,745
You will soon become
the Korean servant Nam Sookee.

1235
02:16:05,220 --> 02:16:07,222
I'm a talented counterfeiter.

1236
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:09,547
I arranged it
with a photography studio.

1237
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:13,862
From tomorrow, we'll
give Sookee a new life.

1238
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:15,470
I'm glad.

1239
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:17,583
Marry me once again.

1240
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:19,865
This time as Nam Sookee.

1241
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:24,226
You want another wedding night?

1242
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:33,463
I think I like you, slightly.

1243
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:39,306
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1244
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:42,468
all by herself...

1245
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:47,270
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1246
02:16:47,860 --> 02:16:50,386
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1247
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:53,543
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1248
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:57,421
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1249
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:59,462
Of course. It's illegal.

1250
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:03,467
So even if my love for
you leads me to ruin,

1251
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:05,504
don't pity me.

1252
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,426
Love?

1253
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:11,508
What does a crook know about love?

1254
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,664
What's that?

1255
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:36,666
Fire!

1256
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:49,351
Come this way!

1257
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:50,427
This way!

1258
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:03,070
Because you desired me

1259
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:05,222
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1260
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:07,780
I have been born anew, it's true.

1261
02:19:09,060 --> 02:19:10,869
I'm grateful for that.

1262
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:15,062
I'll allow a kiss.

1263
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:21,261
No.

1264
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:22,347
Why not?

1265
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:27,462
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1266
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:30,550
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1267
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:37,671
After this I'll thrust
in deep, to your navel.

1268
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:40,664
Please do that.

1269
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:46,182
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1270
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:49,304
You know you can't
deceive me in such matters.

1271
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:58,184
If I could be yours
for ten minutes,

1272
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:00,262
what would you give in exchange?

1273
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:03,227
Whatever your heart desires.

1274
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:06,264
Anything in this whole wide world.

1275
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,827
There's much
I want to teach you.

1276
02:20:33,980 --> 02:20:37,143
You'll become a completely new woman.

1277
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:31,345
It won't hurt.
You know from those books?

1278
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:35,345
In truth, women feel the
greatest pleasure

1279
02:22:35,380 --> 02:22:37,348
when taken by force.

1280
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:40,664
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1281
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:01,105
Would you fetch those for me?

1282
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:13,510
OK, look here.

1283
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:15,543
One, two, three!

1284
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:59,022
<i>Respected Uncle,</i>

1285
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:04,941
<i>it always pained me to see you straining</i>

1286
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:09,901
<i>to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya,</i>

1287
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:13,109
<i>and even to quiver your voice
like a nobleman.</i>

1288
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:21,706
<i>So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.</i>

1289
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:27,063
<i>That man is the son of a Korean farmhand.</i>

1290
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:33,021
<i>Oh, did my gift arrive safely?</i>

1291
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:36,907
<i>Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.</i>

1292
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:39,749
<i>I'm afraid that in real life,</i>

1293
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:44,347
<i>no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.</i>

1294
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:49,984
<i>But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,</i>

1295
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:52,506
<i>I feel "slightly" grateful.</i>

1296
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:09,427
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1297
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:13,465
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1298
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:16,421
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1299
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:19,504
That I used to cherish more than anything.

1300
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:22,581
Let's see...

1301
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:23,627
First...

1302
02:27:26,820 --> 02:27:28,549
<i>First of all.</i>

1303
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:39,669
<i>The Lizard Skin.</i>

1304
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:54,344
<i>Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie.</i>

1305
02:28:04,620 --> 02:28:07,464
May I please
smoke a cigarette, sir?

1306
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,341
Sir.

1307
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:14,387
<i>Bells and Balls.</i>

1308
02:28:17,820 --> 02:28:19,743
<i>The Mortician's Bedroom.</i>

1309
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:34,824
How could you
let a little girl fool you?

1310
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:42,025
<i>But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i>

1311
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:50,670
I'll bind two books with the skin
of these bitches.

1312
02:28:50,820 --> 02:28:54,620
And you, you'll be the third volume.

1313
02:28:56,020 --> 02:29:01,470
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

1314
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:06,501
Please change the destination
to Shanghai.

1315
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:09,703
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1316
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:11,549
Yes, that's correct.

1317
02:29:12,300 --> 02:29:13,984
Show me your passports.

1318
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:22,943
Miss Nam Sookee?

1319
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:27,629
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1320
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:38,426
You need to pay an additional three yen.

1321
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:39,821
All right.

1322
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:45,387
Hideko was

1323
02:29:46,700 --> 02:29:49,909
like a peach that I looked at
on its branch.

1324
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:52,826
I was content just
imagining its flavor.

1325
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:56,150
Should I have bitten into it?

1326
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:57,987
No, no.

1327
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:03,741
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1328
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:09,624
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1329
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:12,982
Peering into each of those fantasies

1330
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:16,069
was this old man's humble recreation.

1331
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:19,669
What to do, now that it's all over?

1332
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:22,661
You should at least tell me your story.

1333
02:30:24,580 --> 02:30:28,062
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1334
02:30:28,780 --> 02:30:32,068
Was she fully ripe? Tell me.

1335
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:37,590
A cigarette might help my memory.

1336
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,068
Right, right...

1337
02:30:41,260 --> 02:30:45,060
You have that silly
penchant for cigarettes?

1338
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:06,071
So how was Hideko?

1339
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:16,105
You have no windows here?

1340
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:22,943
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1341
02:31:34,700 --> 02:31:36,509
<i>That's it, good.</i>

1342
02:31:48,460 --> 02:31:49,871
<i>Why aren't you talking?</i>

1343
02:31:50,140 --> 02:31:52,347
You can't stop there,
dear fellow.

1344
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:54,708
So, where did you touch first?

1345
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:56,865
<i>Her face?</i>

1346
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:00,546
Her breasts?

1347
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:04,546
Or straight for her cunt?

1348
02:32:06,580 --> 02:32:08,105
Was it soft?

1349
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:10,624
Did it tighten up?

1350
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:14,142
Did it have many wrinkles?

1351
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:17,103
Was it sufficiently wet?

1352
02:32:17,140 --> 02:32:20,508
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1353
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:24,831
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1354
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:56,625
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings...</i>

1355
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:03,865
<i>I dare say
no book has ever described</i>

1356
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:06,022
<i>such a ferocious wedding night.</i>

1357
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:14,069
<i>I thought I heard a nightingale sing.</i>

1358
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:52,948
<i>And the clear,
bright crimson blood!</i>

1359
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:04,787
<i>Thus the Lady became my wife.</i>

1360
02:34:05,220 --> 02:34:08,906
<i>Coy one moment, bold the next...</i>

1361
02:34:12,860 --> 02:34:17,548
But how was she coy,

1362
02:34:17,620 --> 02:34:21,750
how was she bold, tell it to me in detail!

1363
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:25,230
A story is all about the journey.

1364
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:28,101
You should know.

1365
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:31,349
Did she resist?

1366
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:35,066
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1367
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:39,265
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1368
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:41,350
Or else...

1369
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:44,381
Did she beg you to do it?

1370
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:48,702
Like <i>the lady in
The Widow's Lapdog?</i>

1371
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:53,631
How dare you!

1372
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:55,662
Hideko is my wife.

1373
02:34:56,100 --> 02:35:00,662
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1374
02:36:36,740 --> 02:36:37,787
It's odd...

1375
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:41,304
Your smoke.

1376
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:47,183
It's cold, blue,

1377
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:54,707
and strangely beautiful.

1378
02:36:55,940 --> 02:37:02,869
You too have become soft,
slow and dull.

1379
02:37:04,460 --> 02:37:07,623
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1380
02:37:08,420 --> 02:37:10,741
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1381
02:37:14,460 --> 02:37:18,829
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1382
02:44:01,460 --> 02:44:05,670
<i>I hear a sound in the distance</i>

1383
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:09,950
<i>that sounds like the steps of my love</i>

1384
02:44:10,020 --> 02:44:14,230
<i>An echo that makes my heart</i>

1385
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:17,582
<i>Skip a beat</i>

1386
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:22,903
<i>But I wait all through the night</i>

1387
02:44:22,940 --> 02:44:26,547
<i>And my love never comes to me</i>

1388
02:44:27,180 --> 02:44:31,424
<i>There is no end to the heartache</i>

1389
02:44:31,460 --> 02:44:35,146
<i>That grips me in this hour</i>

1390
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:39,506
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1391
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:43,183
<i>My dear love</i>

1392
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:48,100
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1393
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:52,346
<i>My dear love</i>

1394
02:45:09,980 --> 02:45:14,190
<i>But then in my waiting heart</i>

1395
02:45:14,220 --> 02:45:18,509
<i>Suddenly happiness overflows</i>

1396
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:22,790
<i>There you are in the distance</i>

1397
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:26,620
<i>Coming to me</i>

1398
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:31,344
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1399
02:45:31,380 --> 02:45:35,226
<i>Filled with happiness</i>

1400
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:39,546
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1401
02:45:39,980 --> 02:45:43,701
<i>Flowers start to bloom</i>

1402
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:48,060
<i>Come my lover, come to me</i>

1403
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:52,027
<i>I missed you so</i>

1404
02:45:52,820 --> 02:45:56,381
<i>Let's dream of happy times</i>

1405
02:45:57,060 --> 02:46:01,190
<i>Like long ago</i>

1406
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:22,710
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1407
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:26,586
<i>Filled with happiness</i>

1408
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:30,900
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1409
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:35,106
<i>Flowers start to bloom</i>

1410
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:39,420
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1411
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:43,382
<i>My dear love</i>

1412
02:46:44,220 --> 02:46:47,861
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1413
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:52,585
<i>My dear love</i>

1
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,373
Through books,
one comes to possess...

2
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:02,405
The road of life

3
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,546
The road to beautiful dreams
is a long one

4
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,750
The wind blows
and frost covers the road

5
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,749
Wind and frost dries out the plain face

6
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,859
In this mortal world

7
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,392
How many different directions
can beautiful dreams take

8
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:26,361
To find the love
one cannot stop dreaming of

9
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,367
The road follows the man frantically

10
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,877
Mortal life is

11
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,876
Beautiful dreams
and passionate aspirations

12
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,714
Vaguely in one's dreams

13
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,684
A dim glimmer of tears

14
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:52,188
Going from place to place

15
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,133
My shoes!

16
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,763
To find the direction
my heart wants to go

17
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,730
In the dream the wind seems to
sigh lightly once in a while

18
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,737
How come it's so torn?!

19
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:14,010
GUOBEI COUNTY

20
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:23,219
"Walk five miles to the south..."

21
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,724
But which direction is south?

22
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,111
Good heavens!

23
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,175
Just as the sun breaks through,
suddenly it pours with rain!

24
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:49,144
Can't you take pity
on lonely travellers in a hurry?

25
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,857
This has not been one of my better days.
At least I haven't run into thieves.

26
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,029
Don't run! Don't run, thief!

27
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,771
Don't run away!
Let's stand against him!

28
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,717
Sir, please forgive us
I'll return your money to you.

29
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,711
You dare steal my money!
You deserve to die!

30
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,298
The road in the mortal realm

31
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:39,261
Happy young man

32
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,934
The road is rocky

33
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:46,936
It's rocky and sunlight
does not penetrate

34
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,948
In the dust and mud

35
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:56,116
How many different directions
does happiness take

36
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,115
Fragments of the dreams
are like the wind and rain

37
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,855
The road follows
the man frantically

38
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,825
Fragments of the dreams
are like the wind and rain

39
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,831
The road follows the man frantically

40
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,208
Don't run! Let's see if
he's the wanted criminal!

41
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,777
-What? What?
-Is it him?

42
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,882
-Drag him over to that side!
-Lee's take a look!

43
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,257
Get out of the way!

44
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,253
Get out of the way
Get out of the way!

45
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,263
-Don't go
-Don't go!

46
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:45,261
Let's see if it's you
No! Let's go!

47
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,072
Thank you, sir.

48
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,073
Hey! Come here!

49
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,113
Not him!
Get out of our way!

50
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:05,580
Don't interfere
in my accumulation of wealth!

51
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,028
Hey, don't run!

52
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,896
It's not him! Move!

53
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,891
Don't run!

54
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,863
-Don't go! Don't go!
-Don't go? It's coming from over there!

55
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,637
-Don't go?
-Don't go!

56
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,870
Don't go! Don't go!

57
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,005
If they don't run,
then they are not wanted criminals!

58
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,972
-Did someone say "Don't run"?
-Criminal!

59
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,916
-Wow! Is it a festival?
-You!

60
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,583
You've money for the dead stuck to you!
Trying to take advantage of me?

61
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,081
Sir, you're got to be joking!
I don't spend this kind of money.

62
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:43,290
You'll be able to spend it
sooner or later.

63
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,627
Thank you.

64
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,599
Hello, sir.
Are you looking for a room?

65
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,692
-Ah Gan, help him with his luggage.
-Coming!

66
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,637
-We have a nice room...
-I'm here for what you owe Jaap Bou Jaai.

67
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,631
-It's all for nothing
-Hey! How rude!

68
00:07:56,076 --> 00:08:00,035
-Why a different debt collector every time?
-The last one was murdered.

69
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,239
As you'll be murdered anyway, why don't
you do me a favour, and not collect it?

70
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,645
Please don't joke.

71
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,724
Sir, can I take a look at your bills,
please? New rules.

72
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,291
New rules? Let me see!
-You can't look at them!

73
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,461
-You can't
-The book of accounts...

74
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,801
The ink has run!
How will you collect the money?

75
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,763
If I can't collect the money, then
I won't have money to return. Please...

76
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,773
As there's no record in the accounts,
that means I don't owe any money.

77
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,772
You still hanging around?
If you don't leave, I'll have you arrested

78
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,215
Sir, where can I get
free shelter for one night?

79
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,092
-Free lodgings?
-Yes.

80
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:53,088
Go to the Lan Yeuk Temple!

81
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,195
Madam,
I'm not lying to you this time...

82
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,606
Where is Lan Yeuk Temple?

83
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,169
Lan Yeuk Temple?

84
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,146
Go east for three and a half miles.

85
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,240
When you see a creepy-looking
old temple, that will be it.

86
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,513
What's the matter?
-What's with him?

87
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:15,511
-Thank you.
-How brave..

88
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,249
Sorry. Excuse me.

89
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,587
-I wonder what's..-
-Madame, buy this.

90
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:31,561
He's going to die..

91
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,900
-Let him go..
-We shouldn't let him go...

92
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,478
That painting was painted beautifully!

93
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,510
Sir, you have a lot of taste.
Name a price.

94
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,681
I don't even have a container to boil water.
How can I buy a painting?

95
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,828
High class taste, low status. Go away.

96
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,855
Hey, what are you doing?

97
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,924
I also stock coffins. By the time
yours is made, your time will be up.

98
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,959
-Thank you.
-Hey I forgot to tell you.

99
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,233
The wolves in the forest
have been hungry for a long time.

100
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,672
Once it gets dark,
you won't be able to avoid them!

101
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,633
Move it

102
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,485
Hey, don't eat me! If you eat me,
then I'll be dead.

103
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,539
LAN YEUK TEMPLE

104
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,489
Is anyone there?

105
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,694
I gather your fight is over.

106
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,693
Brother Hah Hau, you've been fighting me
for seven years, and lost for seven years.

107
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,230
But I must say you have patience.

108
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,834
Wherever I go into hiding,
you're hard on my trail.

109
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,779
Yin Chik Ha, in only six months at Lan
Yeuk Temple, your rusty sword is sharper.

110
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,682
No. It's only because
you wasted your youth.

111
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:08,176
Your ambitions were too grand,
and you didn't try to improve yourself.

112
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,678
In the name of the superficial title of
world's best swordsman,

113
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,988
you show off your abilities too often,
and you harbour ill intentions.

114
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,586
Your moves are not clean,
and you're too hot-tempered.

115
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:19,326
You strike quickly but inaccurately.

116
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,392
Even if you were to win,
it would mean you were just lucky.

117
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,361
Yin Chik Ha, I came to fight you,
not listen to you preach. You, you...

118
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,708
you're right.
You are totally right.

119
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,370
Really, you should know better.

120
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,404
you're already a better fighter. By pointing
out his faults, you're making him lose face.

121
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:39,374
You too. The bearded man is already
avoiding you. Why are still following him?

122
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,217
Why not put down your swords,
and be nice to each other?

123
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:46,214
You have to know that the universe
is infinite, and true love lasts forever.

124
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,353
We must love each other,
and not slaughter each other,

125
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:53,355
because love is
the strongest weapon of all.

126
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,964
You've got even more to say than him!

127
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,930
Hey, I'm not following you.

128
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,770
-Part of it came off!
-So, go love it!

129
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,944
Scholar, if you're in need of love,
go to a bordello. Don't wait here.

130
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,943
-I just need a place to stay.
-Out of the question!

131
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,444
Why is it out of the question?

132
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,391
-Do you have a brave heart?
-Of course.

133
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,385
Look over there.

134
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,723
If you hear a shout,
you hide behind me.

135
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,897
If a tiger appears,
you'll probably want to hide in my trousers!

136
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,895
There are tigers around here?

137
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,899
There aren't any tigers here, but there's
something even scarier than tigers here.

138
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,302
Why speak so close to me?

139
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:44,340
Because I have bad breath, and I don't
want to listen to your nonsense.

140
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,817
Leave here immediately!

141
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,945
Otherwise,
no amount of love will save you!

142
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,890
-I understand. I'll leave.
-Me too!

143
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,292
Damn!

144
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,567
Brother Hah Hau,

145
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,601
you were so ambitious alive, yet in death,
you're still a smelly old husk.

146
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,446
So what was the paint of
being so competitive?

147
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,442
I won't stand by and let your corpse
be exposed to the elements.

148
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,716
Still tip to your old tricks! Even when
you're dead, you still want to fight me!

149
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,323
Prajna Pararnita!

150
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:35,490
Luckily the water was shallow, or else
I would have splashed water on myself!

151
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,060
The monsters and spirits
are causing trouble again!

152
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:07,055
Darn! The scholar didn't leave

153
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,180
I have no bad intentions towards you.
I'm just passing by.

154
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:27,141
If you're afraid, I'll throw it away!

155
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:41,055
What's the matter?

156
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,227
Oh! My stole!

157
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:47,194
I'll go get it for you!

158
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,600
The water is really deep!

159
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,681
Why don't you come out of the water,
before you drown?

160
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,048
Get out quickly!

161
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,019
Thank you.

162
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,013
As it's dark right now, it'll be difficult
to find it. I'll get it for you tomorrow.

163
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,958
I'm freezing.

164
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,660
How come your hand
is colder than mine?

165
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,433
Because you're warmer than me.

166
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,039
Miss, your complexion is pasty,
you must be ill.

167
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,943
You'd better go and see a doctor.

168
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,938
As long as you give me some warmth,
then I'll be fine.

169
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:34,083
I'm sorry I pushed you away,
but if I hadn't, I'd have spit all over you.

170
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:38,079
I'm in pain,...

171
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,359
I shouldn't have
pushed you away.

172
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,294
I'm really cold.

173
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,391
I'm completely soaked. If you lean on me,
you'll be even colder.

174
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,095
-Are you cold or in pain?
-It's really windy. Carry me instead.

175
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:54,095
You even want me to carry you?

176
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,304
you're really heavy.
I can't carry you on my own.

177
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,303
Why don't I get someone to help...?

178
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:13,181
you seem rather kind. It's a shame
you came to the wrong place,

179
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:19,197
or else you wouldn't have to die
such a wrongful death.

180
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,396
How come I'm still in the water?

181
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,072
Miss You forgot your qin!

182
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:24,885
Why are you following me?

183
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,093
Hey! What's the matter with you?

184
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,262
There's a bad person around!
If I don't run, I'll die!

185
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,263
A bad person? Who?
Why can't I see him?

186
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,720
Wait...

187
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,040
Die, die!
I'll squash you till you're dead!

188
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:14,069
I'll squash you till you're dead
Die! Why are you still here?

189
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,072
Oh! The snake!

190
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,423
What about the snake?

191
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,394
don't speak so loudly.

192
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,694
That bad person just passed us.

193
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,461
Which, bad person?

194
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,197
That bearded man who lives in Lan Yeuk
Temple. If he sees us, were dead.

195
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,162
Oh... you mean the bearded man
who lives next door to me.

196
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,667
I knew he wasn't a good person.

197
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,848
Its too dangerous for you to be alone.
Shall I accompany you back?

198
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,374
Don't! My family doesn't like it
when I consort with strangers.

199
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,285
-They're very strict!
-Miss

200
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,380
How about this?
Why don't I act as a decoy,

201
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,348
so when the bearded man
catches me, you're off the hook.

202
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:05,787
Let's just go with this plan...
Don't let him see you!

203
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:12,092
Miss,
allow me to return your qin to you.

204
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,311
What's your name?

205
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,307
Ling Choi San.

206
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,785
What's yours?

207
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,755
I'm called Nip Siu Shin.

208
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,749
Nip Siu Sihn. Tomorrow night...

209
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:39,754
I'll see you at the little pavilion
tomorrow night.

210
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,961
you're still trying to escape?!

211
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:54,928
You're in danger!

212
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,742
Now that you're shown yourself,
you won't be able to escape!

213
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,501
You think you're the only one
who can shout?! I can shout too!

214
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,869
Darn Daoist monk

215
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,773
We're only looking for a place
to call our own.

216
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,209
The people I kill
deserve to die anyway.

217
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,907
Why do you persist in not letting
bygones be bygones?

218
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,404
I spit on you Who says I have
anything to do with you?

219
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,512
I avoid the complications of the martial
ails by hiding in this haunted place!

220
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,512
As we bath want to reduce
the criminality of mortals,

221
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,785
and bless mankind,

222
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,760
upon reflection,
our intentions are as one!

223
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,696
Were the same?! I'll be damned
if lye anything in common with you!

224
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,966
If you play with fire,
that means you're toying with me.

225
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,964
Sooner or later, you'll get yourself in a lot of
trouble! And that's when I'll destroy you!

226
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,947
you're a good person. don't ever come
to look for me again. Siu Sihn.'

227
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:31,051
It's the bearded man...

228
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,967
You who are filled with love...
did you run into something last night?

229
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,113
I've experienced
everything in this room.

230
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:56,076
Then did you see anything strange?

231
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,948
Does that include you?

232
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,954
How dare you!

233
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,093
I'm talking about serious matters,
but you're joking around with me!

234
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,840
How can I tell when you're serious
and when you're joking?

235
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,209
you're always smiling.

236
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:24,171
I advise you to leave immediately!
There are ghosts here!

237
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,046
I dare you to call them
all out to see me

238
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,542
You stupid scholar!

239
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,044
If it were easy to spot a ghost,
there wouldn't be so many around!

240
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,217
They won't appear during the day,
you stupid boy!

241
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,193
Bearded man,
you don't have to try to scare me.

242
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:39,186
If they don't appear during the day,
have them come and get me tonight!

243
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:46,160
If you see them, then its too late already.
Why won't you listen to me?

244
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:50,968
Damn you!

245
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,945
If I see you here again,
I'll throw you out!

246
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,880
I'm not afraid of being thrown out!

247
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,875
No? OK, then. I'll kill you!

248
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,613
Better that I scare him away
before the ghosts scare him to death.

249
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,922
I hope I can save him.

250
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,919
There are ghosts here?
Maybe he's just trying to scare me.

251
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,624
What happened to the bottom half
of my garment?

252
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:24,241
Hey, bearded man!
What happened to my bottom half?

253
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:28,635
The bottom half?
It's attached to your top half!

254
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,615
I don't know what you mean
Keep it!

255
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,608
He doesn't talk sense. It won't make
a difference whether I save him or not!

256
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,922
As there's no proof one way or
the other, why don't I just make it up?

257
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,450
You really stayed
at Lan Yeuk Temple?

258
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,415
-The records show that you owe 70 taels.
-He stayed at Lan Yeuk Temple..

259
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,821
-You should pay up.
-Take them.

260
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,398
-Thank you, sir.
-Ah....

261
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,699
Let's follow him and see..

262
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,535
Boss.

263
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,007
You scared me to death
What do you want with me?

264
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,772
You scared me so much, I forgot.

265
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,770
Excuse me.

266
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,853
Siu Sihn!

267
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,960
Siu Sihn!

268
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,804
Can't you hear me calling you?

269
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,001
don't go!

270
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,909
-Lets go!
-If you can hear me, then don't go!

271
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,811
Don't go!

272
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:23,838
Who shouted "Don't go"?
Who was it?

273
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,783
Who was it?

274
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:30,482
Let me take a good look at you!
Let me see who's the wanted criminal?

275
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,447
Why are you still running away?

276
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,665
The man with high class taste
and low status is passing by again.

277
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,903
-Owner.
-What are you doing here again?

278
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:59,907
Owner, where's the painting
from yesterday?

279
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:05,446
Money, which means you have status.
Let me find it for you immediately.

280
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,783
Owner, what are you doing?

281
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,694
This doesn't make sense!

282
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,164
No one's wanted it for a year.
I should be able to find it.

283
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,157
Come back tomorrow,
and I'll definitely have found it!

284
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:21,161
Fine. I'll come back tomorrow.

285
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:35,575
The wind shouldn't be able
to blow out three lanterns.

286
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,749
If wolves appear,
they'll be taken care of!

287
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,819
"See how the Yellow River
moves out of heaven."

288
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,989
"Entering the sea never to return."

289
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,659
"See how much
it looks like bright mirrors."

290
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,691
"Silken black in the morning,
changed by night to snow."

291
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:54,695
"Oh, let a man of spirit
venture where..."

292
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,209
"See how the Yellow River moves out of
heaven. Entering the sea never to return."

293
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,541
"See how much
it looks like bright mirrors."

294
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,139
"Silken black in the morning..."
"Oh, let a man venture..."

295
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,709
"And never tip his golden cup
empty towards the moon!"

296
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,948
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

297
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,977
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

298
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,853
"The Six Classics are stored
in my heart."

299
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,256
"A branch grows above
the almond bud."

300
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,252
"If you don't run away, I'll run away!'
I've ran myself out of breath!

301
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,834
Why don't I see wolves?

302
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,306
The wolves are coming!

303
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:44,244
THE WATER RESIDENCE

304
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,328
Nip Siu Sihn!

305
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:46,814
Siu Sihn!

306
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,391
Siu Sihn! Open the door!

307
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,793
Why did you come here?

308
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,526
-I heard the sound of qin music...
-Hurry up and come in first!

309
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,127
-I told you not to come for me.
-I'm leaving tomorrow.

310
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,900
-I came to say goodbye.
-Tomorrow?

311
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,841
-Yes. But I'll come to see you again.
-Don't ever do that!

312
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,275
Darn! Someone's coming!

313
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:16,270
The Old Dame will smell your presence,
but not if you're in the water.

314
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,241
I have to get wet again?

315
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,196
Sister Siu Sihn.

316
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,192
Ski Ching. I know that the Old Dame
is waiting impatiently.

317
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:43,196
I'll come out
after finishing my make-up.

318
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,637
You worthless creature!

319
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,984
You dare hide another man
behind my back!

320
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,475
I didn't do that!

321
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,579
You know ft not true!

322
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,523
I already have proof!

323
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,323
Look at it yourself!

324
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,388
I can't believe
you would write such things!

325
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,560
You're obviously
working against me!

326
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,230
I need to teach you a lesson!
You worthless creature!

327
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,230
Have you forgotten
how I punished you before?!

328
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:21,234
If you don't behave yourself, I'll destroy
your ashes so that your soul will be lost!

329
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:31,253
Tonight,
you must find a live one for me,

330
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:35,248
so that I can replenish my chi,
and extend my life.

331
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,454
As its the first time you're done wrong,
I'll give you another chance.

332
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,695
Siu Ching, get some medicine
for your sister's wounds.

333
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,693
Yes.

334
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,736
I've already arranged for you to marry
the Lord of the Black Mountain.

335
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,475
you're getting married
in three days.

336
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:00,440
Although this old fool has a wasted body,
he's not easy to deal with.

337
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,552
When he gets mad,
even we aren't able to deal with him.

338
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:07,547
When you become his, don't even
think about coming back to us.

339
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,492
-Siu Sihn.
-Yes.

340
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:13,453
Come and try on the dress.
Its your bridal outfit.

341
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,328
Come and help me.

342
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:47,454
What is that smell?
It smells like a mortal.

343
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,336
My garment got torn,.

344
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,134
How come you're so clumsy?

345
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,572
My hands are dirty.
I'll wash my hands.

346
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,667
Siu Ching. I'll help you.

347
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,702
-You don't have to be so polite.
-I should.

348
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,204
-Why did you splash water on me?
-I was just careless.

349
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:08,242
-Siu Ching, don't argue with your sister.
-OK

350
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,686
You haven't finished cleaning yourself.

351
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,248
You did it deliberately
I'm not washing any more!

352
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,250
Siu Sihn, disrobe.
I'll help you mend it.

353
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,029
-Siu Sihn. What are you doing?
-In, preparing to bathe.

354
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,939
I'll dress tip a bit,
then I'll be ready to go out.

355
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,934
It's almost dawn. If I don't go soon,
there won't be time to get you a live one.

356
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,572
See how obedient your sister is, Siu Ching.
You have to learn to be more like her.

357
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:17,645
Madame, rest assured.
I won't disappoint you again tonight.

358
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:25,619
Come on.

359
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:35,629
Hurry up!

360
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:51,444
What's the hurry? In three days time,
after I get married, this room will be yours.

361
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:10,931
Put your clothes back on.
I won't look.

362
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,009
Come over here.

363
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,071
-your Old Dame...
-Hurry up and go!

364
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,412
But I have so much to discuss!

365
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,644
Lets talk at the little pavilion.

366
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,643
-Then I'll wait for you there!
-OK!

367
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:40,627
Master Ling.

368
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,969
How did you get here so quickly?

369
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,466
It's quicker when travelling
on the road higher up.

370
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,945
Are you OK?

371
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,905
Do you like this painting?
I'll give it to you.

372
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,611
The painting...

373
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,112
Why do you have it?

374
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,923
A year ago, my father
commissioned this painting.

375
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,920
I only managed to recover it
during the Festival of Hungry Ghosts.

376
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,531
The woman in the painting is me.

377
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,493
When you look at the painting,
it'll be as if you're looking at me.

378
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,669
It sounds like you're asking me
never to see you again.

379
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,643
I have to marry
the Lord of the Black Mountain.

380
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:22,943
I have to get married in three days.

381
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,006
I know you're not
a willing party to this.

382
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:29,077
If you're in trouble,
I'll take you away from here.

383
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,013
Its almost dawn, let me return.

384
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:37,017
Dawn is good.
We can leave immediately!

385
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,260
Let go!

386
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,255
If you won't come with me,
I won't let go.

387
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,929
Let me go!

388
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,927
Siu Sihn.

389
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,203
you impoverished scholar!
Stop dreaming impossible dreams.

390
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:55,235
you just want my wealth! lye seen
many like you. I won't be tricked by you!

391
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:59,080
Why are you saying such things?

392
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:03,042
If you don't leave now,
I'll have someone arrest you!

393
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,382
Fine! I'll leave.

394
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:13,386
Take care of yourself!

395
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:33,007
Master, I can't find the painting of
the beautiful woman washing her hair.

396
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,985
How about another painting?

397
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:37,146
I've seen that woman.
She's too heartless

398
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:41,056
She's also been dead for over a year.
Forget her! Lets take shelter over there.

399
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,288
You don't have to be so harsh
and curse her to death!

400
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,262
Don't stand so close,
you'll only get wet!

401
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,196
Master,
stop being so superstitious!

402
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,894
Hey, don't go!

403
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,892
Who called out "don't go"?

404
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,862
You dare cry wolf?!
Damn you!

405
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,406
I'm not a wanted criminal.

406
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,537
I don't care. Whoever shouts,
I'll chase him!

407
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,979
You won't get any reward
for arresting me.

408
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:07,974
Just chase him We won't lose
anything by doing that!

409
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:12,979
This world is a heartless world.

410
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,519
Lau Yat Dou?
The bearded man is a murderer?

411
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:20,019
That means
Ski Sihn is in great danger.

412
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,930
Help me down slowly.

413
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:26,062
Be careful don't get my clothes wet
You can't afford to replace them!

414
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,061
Siu Sihn! I'm coming to save you!

415
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:32,065
My clothes are soaked
My mother will kill me!

416
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:36,402
The Dao in the mortal realm

417
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,274
Dao, Dao, Dao.. Dao!

418
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,048
The Dao that can be followed
is not the eternal Dec

419
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,155
The Dao of Heaven
The Dao of Earth

420
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,927
The Dao of Man
The Dao of the Sword

421
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,264
Evil Dao, Good Dao,
Yellow Dao, Whatever Dao

422
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,896
Dao of Dao
My own Daoist place is very Dao

423
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:02,168
I spit, I spit, I spit, I spit, I spit

424
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:06,132
I speak nonsense

425
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:12,439
Here and there, where's the road

426
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,043
The Way of Ikebana,
the Way of sado, ha!

427
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,246
The Dao of Yin.
the Dao of Yang

428
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,914
Zero degrees blandness

429
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:19,082
Blinding brightness

430
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,147
A ghost cries
Evil cults

431
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,283
Fornicating dogs

432
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,419
Your place, his place
Wolf in sheep s clothing, hey

433
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,123
I'm seeking my own Dao

434
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,123
I seek...

435
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:37,738
My own Dao

436
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:47,240
Why are you leaving so soon?

437
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:11,100
Siu Sihn.

438
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:19,442
Siu Sihn.

439
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:26,279
How come the wind
is blowing so strong?

440
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,155
Master Ling!

441
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,489
What happened to your eye?

442
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,256
-I got hit by a dummy.
-Which dummy?

443
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:35,221
Lie down!

444
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,224
Why do we have to lie down?

445
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:41,261
Its going to rain.

446
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:44,503
Even if we shelter, well still get rained on.
I'm getting used to being wet.

447
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,739
Let's go to the little pavilion
to take shelter.

448
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:51,146
Siu Sihn, you're in great danger.
The bearded man is a murderer.

449
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:54,879
Lets talk when we get inside.

450
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,844
I rushed back on purpose
to tell you to be careful.

451
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,849
Even the roof of the pavilion
is leaking.

452
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:11,424
Did you really
come back to save me?

453
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,805
I really wanted to see you.

454
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:20,800
The art dealer said the woman
in the painting died a long time ago.

455
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:30,777
Let's not talk about
such things right now.

456
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:36,382
Don't you remember that I have to
get married in a few days?

457
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:51,297
Dawn, please don't come

458
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:59,439
Tonight, let dreams and fantasies

459
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,685
Be alive forever

460
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:07,817
Retaining the truth of the moment

461
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:11,818
To accompany this outpouring of love

462
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:15,998
Ordering the soul to enter

463
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,430
Please ask dawn not to come again

464
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:33,740
The romantic feelings I have now

465
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,054
Take me out of the world

466
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:42,048
And the warm aroma of
the clear breeze

467
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:46,385
Delivers hot love in the cold rain

468
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,623
Silently allowing the undying love
to overcome obstacles

469
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:58,035
Don't allow the daylight

470
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:02,069
To separate us

471
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:06,772
Don't let the long sweet night pass

472
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,948
Please ask dawn
not to show its colours

473
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,635
This enjoyable dreamscape

474
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,436
Will be impossible to replace...

475
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:32,432
I've seen it in the painting.

476
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,736
-Give it back to me!
-The chimes are pleasing to the ear!

477
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:39,705
Give it to me!

478
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,213
-You know qinggong?
-Leave immediately!

479
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,815
Why are you losing your temper?

480
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:47,984
Why haven't you left yet?

481
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,757
I didn't know the anklet was so
important to you. Don't be angry.

482
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:55,755
That's not what I mean. Let me
be honest with you. I'm not a mortal!

483
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,630
You can't say that!
I won't allow you to talk like that!

484
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,107
You say you're not mortal.
What does that make me?

485
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:09,068
I will take responsibility
for what I did just now.

486
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,918
Don't follow me

487
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:18,115
Go and find the bearded man.

488
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:22,024
He's a murderer. By asking me to find him,
you're sending me to death.

489
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,050
If you follow me,
you'll die even sooner!

490
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:28,896
Siu Sihn!

491
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:32,892
-I told you not to follow m&
-You can't leave!

492
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,799
Where's Siu Sihn?

493
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,125
Siu Sihn!

494
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:11,096
I'm not looking for you.

495
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:40,692
Heaven and earth are inexhaustible!
A rite borrowed from heaven and earth!

496
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,798
Master Ling!

497
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,798
That man killed your sister.
We have to report him!

498
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:46,833
I can't go with you!

499
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:50,803
I don't care. I'm taking
you away from here!

500
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,533
Siu Sihn!

501
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,703
Damn! Siu Sihn's disappeared!

502
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,470
GUOBEI COUNTRY COURTHOUSE

503
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,915
SILENCE IN COURT

504
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:29,511
BRIGHT MIRROR
HANGING HIGH

505
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,512
The court is in session!

506
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:38,021
-A crime was reported.
-Yes.

507
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:41,987
-Did you collect the fee yet?
-Not yet, sir. You're missed your seat.

508
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,161
The magistrate is seated.

509
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:48,433
-Have a gargle, sir.
-Wash your face, sir.

510
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,406
Magistrate!

511
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,070
You have me in session and you
haven't paid any of the registration fee!

512
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,569
-You're getting 30 strokes of the rod first
-Double! 60 strokes!

513
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,141
Magistrate, please don't beat me.
If you do, I'll forget everything!

514
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,549
Have you collected the fee yet?

515
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,849
If we don't beat him up,
how can we get the money?

516
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,219
That won't do! Beat him!

517
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:08,055
Magistrate, I just found
the murderer Lau Yat Dou!

518
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:10,049
Lau Yat Dou?

519
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,528
-Who in the world is he?
-Magistrate...

520
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,997
Yau Yat DOU is a wanted man
with 1000 taels of gold on his head,

521
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,934
but we arrested him six hours ago.

522
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,371
This is infuriating! I'm the one
with the money-hungry reputation!

523
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,634
How can you be
more greedy than me?

524
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,542
Do you want to close me down
and cheat me out of my reward money?

525
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,012
I'll have you beaten
till your backside catches fire!

526
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,877
Beat him

527
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,644
-I did see Lou Yat Dou
-You've seen Lau Yat Dou?

528
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,380
Then I ask you,
who's the person I arrested?

529
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,116
-Of course it's Lau Yat Dou.
-Your crime is doubly serious!

530
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,919
Beat him

531
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,915
I'm innocent!
You're arrested the wrong person!

532
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,087
Magistrate, our men often
arrest the wrong man!

533
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,563
-Really?
-Really.

534
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,499
-Fine. We call for Lau Yat Dou!
-Call for Lau Yat Dou!

535
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,936
We call for Lau Yat Dou!

536
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:57,100
Official, if it really is Lau Yat Dou,
we have to cough up the reward money.

537
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:58,938
Let's deny it.
We'll have him beaten anyway.

538
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,432
you're light.

539
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:03,936
Beat him

540
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,209
I still have to be beaten?

541
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,547
Hold your rods!

542
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:10,111
An assassin!

543
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,519
Its Lau Yat Dou!

544
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:15,514
Lau Yat Dou? Don't rob me!
I really don't have any money!

545
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,385
Official Chiu.

546
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,063
It's Mandarin Yim.

547
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,124
Mandarin?

548
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:27,001
You're all cowards.
I'm reducing all your salaries!

549
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,767
You don't even recognize Mandarin Yin?

550
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:31,002
Mandarin Yin
is renowned in 26 districts

551
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,636
and Guangdong and Guangxi provinces
for being a ruthless judge.

552
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:36,771
He hated corrupt mandarins
ruling the courts so he retired.

553
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,011
Mandarin Yin, you didn't come to arrest
greedy officials, did you?

554
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,783
I don't get involved in the law any more.
I just came to see my young brother.

555
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:46,045
Don't listen to him
He's not my brother!

556
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,650
Slow down.
Maybe we made a mistake again.

557
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:52,094
Reporting, sir.
Lau Yat Dou is here!

558
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:56,191
Sir, the man in the jail
really is Lau Yat Dow

559
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,463
If it's true, then take him away.
Don't create a fuss!

560
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,699
-Go back, go back!
-Yes!

561
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,196
Get down!

562
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,108
Sir, you have to protect me.
He's a murderer!

563
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,600
How dare you!

564
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:11,080
you're not making sense.
This case is too complicated.

565
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,413
If we continue this case,
you have to pay three times more.

566
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,476
-Fine!
-Then who's the murderer?

567
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,474
It's him!

568
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:20,479
I didn't kill anyone. In this case,
no-one has been killed.

569
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:24,689
Official, this magistrate
is exhausted by this case.

570
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,355
What is it, magistrate?

571
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:29,799
The case is serious.
You decide what the increase in fees is.

572
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,759
Listen up, if no one's been killed,
then there is no case.

573
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,603
Why make mountains out of molehills?

574
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:40,565
But if you want us to put on a good show,
you should give us more money.

575
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:42,402
Why are you being silly?

576
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:46,405
Hurry up and bribe me.
I'm the magistrate'

577
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:49,141
-Increase the fee!
-I want to bribe you, but I'm poor.

578
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,620
You can go and steal
or commit robbery!

579
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,454
Magistrate, why don't you
quickly process the case?

580
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,619
As the magistrate
is selling his services cheaply,

581
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,787
why not hand over the money
to process the case?

582
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,559
It's pointless discussing this further.
Where exactly is the crime scene?

583
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:05,558
-Tell us.
-It was Lan Yeuk Temple.

584
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:17,807
Brother Ling, the person who died
tonight wasn't a mortal.

585
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,611
I saw you chop up the woman!

586
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,810
Not a woman, but a female ghost!

587
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,718
A female ghost?

588
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,416
As this is not a mortal matter,
it has nothing to do with me.

589
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:27,856
-Right.
-Then we won't take your money.

590
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:28,950
you're right.

591
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:32,895
-Adjourn the court!
-Court adjourned! Court adjourned!

592
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:36,491
Adjourn the cowl.

593
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,493
I don't believe you.
I know that girl.

594
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,871
-She lives behind Lan Yeuk Temple.
-No-one lives there any more.

595
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:47,469
Behind Lan Yeuk Temple
is an abandoned graveyard.

596
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:51,504
An abandoned graveyard?

597
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:56,751
There has been much unrest lately.
All the temple residents left.

598
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,586
At night the long pitiful sighs
and cries that you hear

599
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:03,548
are actually the cries of
solitary ghosts and wild spirits!

600
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:08,531
Solitary ghosts and wild spirits?

601
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,693
I don't believe you!

602
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,659
Fine. If you don't believe me,
then I'll take you to see the ghosts.

603
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:42,754
Look for yourself!

604
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:58,370
BELOVED DAUGHTER

605
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:02,875
NIP SIU SIHN

606
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,780
Now do you believe me?

607
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,987
She's a ghost?
Then why didn't she kill me?

608
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:13,952
I don't understand either.
Maybe you're still useful to her.

609
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,930
I didn't realize I was useful enough
to be used by someone.

610
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:20,198
Only ghosts would know.

611
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,468
Anyhow, ghosts and mortals are the same.
They use each other to get ahead.

612
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,909
Brother Ling, before it gets dark,
leave here quickly.

613
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,741
Then what about you?

614
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,713
I'm not leaving.

615
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:34,707
The mortal world is too complex.
It isn't easy to separate truth from lies.

616
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,878
With ghosts and spirits though,
matters are black and white, very distinct.

617
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:41,683
I'm staying.

618
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,593
Hurry up and leave!

619
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,122
I¡¯ve thought it over.
You had better stay.

620
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,224
Stay here? Then Siu Sihn
will come looking for me.

621
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:26,327
I want to use you as bait to get the female
ghost and the monster to come out.

622
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,236
I want to completely destroy them!

623
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:32,231
If you stay,
shell definitely come to find you.

624
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:36,235
When that happens, if you ring the bell,
then I'll come and save you.

625
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:40,082
You want to use me to kill Siu Sihn?

626
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,917
You're correct. Recently
they're been very displeased with me.

627
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,185
It seems that the forces of
evil and goad cannot co-exist.

628
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,852
This monster's magic is very strong.

629
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:53,852
Then are you able to defeat it?

630
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:58,066
Don't worry. Evil will definitely not
overcame Goad.

631
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:06,264
Only use this Diamond Sutra
when absolutely necessary.

632
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,802
-What language is this?
-Sanskrit.

633
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:13,180
You have to remember,
if you're calm, you'll find Buddha.

634
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,175
Then,
how you do pronounce the first line?

635
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:19,952
Prajna Paramita!

636
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,446
-You know Sanskrit?
-I don't.

637
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:25,451
Just remember that if you're calm,
you'll find Buddha, and you'll be fine.

638
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:29,922
Also, don't forget to ring the bell
v/hen you see the monster.

639
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:38,172
Prajna Paramita! Prajna Paramita!

640
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,507
-Prajna Paramita!
-I forbid you to chant!

641
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:45,470
If you chant, how are the monsters
supposed to come out and get you?

642
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:51,105
Who is it? Who is it?

643
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:55,107
If you don't answer, I'll open the door!

644
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:07,920
Why did you still come back?

645
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,922
The Old Dame already
knows of your presence.

646
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:13,926
Are you really a ghost?
-Yes.

647
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,398
So you killed
all the people in the old temple?

648
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:20,365
I didn't want to.
I was forced into it.

649
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:24,611
Ling Choi San.

650
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:28,277
Don't come near me
If you come near me, I'll get nasty!

651
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:32,311
Did you hurt yourself in the fall?

652
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:39,217
Don't be afraid of me.
I won't harm you.

653
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,294
Why don't you believe me?

654
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:48,531
Think, have I ever harmed you?

655
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:52,531
All ghosts harm mortals. You're a ghost.
How can you ask me to believe in you?

656
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:56,637
You think that ghosts are scary,
but mortals are even scarier.

657
01:06:56,646 --> 01:07:00,639
Sometimes people are much
more cruel to each other than ghosts are.

658
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:04,246
In addition, some ghosts aren't allowed
to reincarnate into mortal life,

659
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,654
as they have not righted
the wrongs and injustices done.

660
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:10,649
That's why they wander around. Some
ghosts are actually kinder than people.

661
01:07:13,296 --> 01:07:17,255
Then why do you harm people?

662
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,394
I was forced to by the Old Dame.

663
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,666
She is the spirit of
the millennium-old tree here.

664
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:24,105
I was born into a family of
magistrates and officials,

665
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:27,565
but I was killed by corrupt people
while travelling.

666
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:31,570
My father temporarily buried me under an
old tree, but he was murdered soon after.

667
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:38,778
So the Old Dame took control of my corpse
to seduce men to take their energy.

668
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:43,448
She even arranged a marriage between me
and the old monster of Black Mountain!

669
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,325
-I'll leave now!
-Don't go!

670
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:51,323
Siu Sihn!

671
01:07:56,306 --> 01:08:00,265
They're coming.

672
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:04,235
How come
he hasn't ringed the bell yet?

673
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,713
Now you're not afraid of me?

674
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:11,710
No. I'll definitely save you
from the Old Dame.

675
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:14,588
Really? Then before sundown
the day after tomorrow,

676
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:18,288
You must deliver my bones and ashes
to be buried by a family in my village.

677
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:21,730
-Its my only chance for reincarnation.
-don't worry.

678
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,326
Early tomorrow morning,
I'll unearth your ashes and bones.

679
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:29,294
Before sundown the day after tomorrow,
I'll have you back at your village.

680
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,636
Darn! Leave now!

681
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:37,636
The bearded man is a Daoist priest.
He's waiting for a chance to destroy you!

682
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:42,674
The Old Dame asked me to harm you, but
she's lost faith in me, and she's here herself

683
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:46,978
You'd better leave

684
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,521
Don't be afraid! Remain calm.
Buddha will save us.

685
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:53,290
Prajna Paramita, Prajna Paramita,
Prajna Paramita...

686
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,457
Why hasn't that damn
Daoist priest come out yet?

687
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,454
Prajna Paramita...

688
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,899
Its useless! Let's run for it!

689
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,893
You said that I'd find Buddha
if I'm calm in my heart. You were lying!

690
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,632
-What is that?
-The Old Dame's tongue!

691
01:09:14,384 --> 01:09:17,945
-Ling Choi San!
-Siu Sihn

692
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:21,981
Ling Choi San!

693
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:26,585
What is it?

694
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:34,069
Siu Sihn!

695
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:54,445
Siu Sihn!

696
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:22,507
Be careful!
Don't let her tongue enter your mouth!

697
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,535
Let's go this way!

698
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,843
-Siu Sihn!
-Don't worry about me!

699
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:53,905
Ling Choi San!

700
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:01,685
Follow this silk ribbon!
Don't come back!

701
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:05,684
-Siu Sihn I...
-Why haven't you left?!

702
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:11,089
Ling Choi San!

703
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:19,030
Ling Choi San!

704
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:23,034
Siu Sihn!

705
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,843
Ling Choi San!

706
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:32,912
Siu Sihn!

707
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:36,915
The Old Dame?

708
01:11:56,078 --> 01:12:00,014
-You, damn Daoist priest!
-Stupid idiot! Of course its me!

709
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:02,883
Where did you go?
Why did you show up so late?

710
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,285
I told you to ring the bell, but you had
to resist, which almost killed me!

711
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:09,315
Damn Daoist priest, you're interfering
with my feeding habits!

712
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:15,288
I don't care if you kill bad people,
but look at this scholar!

713
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:17,459
He's tall and long-limbed.

714
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,129
He's weak, doesn't use what he's learnt,
and has done nothing in his life!

715
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:23,105
What other good points do you have?

716
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,970
I'm not as good as you've described!

717
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:29,001
If I don't make it up,
I won't be able to win the argument!

718
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,912
If you kill him, that means
you don't give me face!

719
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:35,907
Then when you killed my female servant,
did you think about giving me face?

720
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:39,383
Old bag
We won't discuss the matter of face!

721
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,949
Fine, Lets discuss our martial arts
background! Let's see who's better!

722
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:46,952
Make your move!

723
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:51,389
-Her tongue is longer than yours!
-Move it!

724
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:03,268
Prajna Paramita!

725
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:10,341
"Let the deity
be manifested as a sword!" Go!

726
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:23,188
"Heaven and earth are inexhaustible.
A rite borrowed from heaven and earth!"

727
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:30,932
Siu Sihn!

728
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,966
Ling Choi San!

729
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,945
Don't go over there!

730
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:40,074
Now, the needle!

731
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,108
Don't hurt her! SW Sihn!

732
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:47,112
Idiot! Come back over here!

733
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:08,166
Quickly! Help the priest
deal with the Old Dame!

734
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:11,274
Where should I stick it?

735
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,340
Wherever! Just stick it in

736
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:17,877
-What do I do after I stick it in?
-Just stick it in!

737
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:21,687
Not my backside!

738
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:31,656
The tongue is coming again!

739
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,749
Hurry up and run
Are you waiting to die?

740
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:56,414
Siu Sihn!

741
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:06,567
Lookout!

742
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:16,176
Now you are mine!

743
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:20,171
With one cut...!

744
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,656
Siu Sihn!

745
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:33,389
Siu Sihn Siu Sihn!

746
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:34,624
Have you lost your mind?

747
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,689
You know she harms mortals,
and still you follow?

748
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:40,692
She was forced into it!
Have you no pity?!

749
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:44,164
The mortals have the mortal world,
ghosts have their own dimension!

750
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:47,336
We mortals most not interfere with
the matters of ghosts and spirits!

751
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:50,278
I broke this monster¡¯s magic already!

752
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,077
Although her magic lies deep in her roots,

753
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,243
she won't be able to harm anyone
for 100 years!

754
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:59,278
As long as the status quo is maintained,
you shouldn't interfere with, them!

755
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:10,422
I can't. I promised Siu Sihn I'd bring her
bones and ashes back to her village

756
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,294
so that she may reincarnate into
the mortal world, and live a new life!

757
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,636
Swordsman Yin,

758
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,269
although mortal matters don't concern you,
there are many bandits in Qinghua county.

759
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:25,373
Without you, I'm afraid I won't
be able to bring Siu Sihn back.

760
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:28,145
Swordsman Yin,

761
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,641
I beg you to be generous-hearted,
and make an exception!

762
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:32,917
Help me deliver Siu Sihn's
remains to her village

763
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,356
so she may have a chance
to be a mortal! I beg of you!

764
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:39,350
Get up!

765
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:45,190
I retired because I got so sick of
people's power struggles and hypocrisies,

766
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,634
so that's why I hid in the old temple
and the wilderness.

767
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,664
In front of people,
I pretended to be a ghost.

768
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,838
In front of ghosts,
I thought of myself as a mortal.

769
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,609
The end result is that
I'm neither a ghost or a mortal!

770
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,639
Now,
I don't even know what I am!

771
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:03,277
-Swordsman
-How funny!

772
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,616
Why is it funny?

773
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,850
I'm mortal, yet I took myself away
from the world.

774
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:09,416
But Siu Sihn is a ghost,
and wants to become mortal again!

775
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:11,655
Swordsman, don't analyse
the situation too much.

776
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:15,721
The most important thing is
to take Siu Sihn away from here!

777
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:19,724
Why is the world such a ridiculous place?
I'm a walking mockery!

778
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:23,694
OK, I agree to do what you ask.

779
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:44,883
We found it

780
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,335
-Why are there so many here?
-That's strange!

781
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,633
Which one shall we take?

782
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:59,597
-Its sundown soon! We'll take them all!
-OK!

783
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:03,672
Where is the Diamond Sutra?

784
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,113
-I put it in my backpack.
-Carry it on you,

785
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:10,108
-or else the ghosts won't come with us.
-OK

786
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,058
Follow me closely!

787
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,590
You're going so fast,
how am I supposed to follow you?

788
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:29,594
We're running out of time!
Its almost sundown!

789
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:38,838
We're been riding
for half a day and we're still here!

790
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,042
-It must be the monster's doing!
-Then what should we do?

791
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:45,009
We have to get out of this forest
before sundown!

792
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:08,135
Prajna Paramita!

793
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:12,136
There's a path out! Follow me!

794
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:21,680
TAM LOI INN

795
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:35,595
It seems like there's going to be
a wedding celebration.

796
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,573
-Innkeeper!
-How come there's no-one around?

797
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:42,567
-What if everyone's dead?
-Who's dead? What are you doing here?

798
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:46,705
We want to stay at the inn.

799
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:50,708
Follow me.

800
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,020
That's fine. That will be all.

801
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:58,983
If we don't call for you, don't come out.

802
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:16,034
Siu Sihn, if you're one of them,
please show yourself!

803
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:23,040
Master, are you looking for me?

804
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:31,723
Master, are you looking for us?

805
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:34,059
Damn! Siu Sihn isn't among them!
These are the wrong ones!

806
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:37,863
Be quiet! Take your own burial urn,
and forever disappear!

807
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:41,859
-You may not harm mortals ever again!
-Thank you for your kind act.

808
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,033
Disappear!

809
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,033
don't worry.
We still have one last chance.

810
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:53,404
there's only one left. Siu Sihn,
if its you, please show yourself!

811
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:57,149
Hurry up and show yourself.
Hurry up and show yourself!

812
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:01,111
Master, are you looking for me?

813
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:07,794
Its a male voice.
Damn, we've taken a man's burial urn!

814
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:09,957
Look!

815
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:12,900
Why did you keep on asking me
to came out?

816
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:16,029
Oh, it was you, the inn's servant.

817
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,734
-You scared me to death!
-We didn't call for you!

818
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:22,700
Sneaking up to talk to us like this, you
could have scared us to death! Leave us

819
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:33,046
Siu Sihn?

820
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,990
-Siu Sihn!
-Ling Choi San!

821
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:39,984
Siu Sihn!

822
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:46,991
Thank you, swordsman,
for your princely act of saving my life!

823
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:50,802
That was nothing! Get up, get up!

824
01:21:50,806 --> 01:21:54,799
Yes, no need for heirs and graces.
We're all friends here.

825
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,104
You two stay here and waste time.
I'll go and get a change of horses.

826
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:03,107
We have to prepare to leave
in a hurry tomorrow!

827
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:08,112
Crazy man and persistent woman!
Yuck!

828
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:13,083
Heroes are like that. They have to say
a few words of advice before leaving.

829
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:32,336
"A frozen lake ten miles wide,
snow falling in the sky."

830
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:40,144
"Silken threads of hair,
dreading the arrival of the winter of life."

831
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,619
"Facing the moon alone,
longing to be together."

832
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:53,000
"Envious of mandarin ducks eternal love
rather than, the immortality of gods."

833
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:58,362
This painting is the only valuable I'm leaving
behind. You must always keep it with you.

834
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,468
We must get to Qinghua County
before sundown tomorrow,

835
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:06,937
or else I won't make it on time
to reincarnate as a mortal.

836
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:10,908
Then you should be happy. It's rare to get
another chance to live as a mortal again.

837
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:21,426
When dawn comes,
we'll be separated forever!

838
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:25,457
We won't ever have a chance
to see each other again!

839
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:29,460
I hope that dawn won't come too soon.

840
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:34,665
Prajna Pararnita!

841
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:41,072
The aura of evil!

842
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:47,110
Head soup?

843
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:54,756
Ghosts getting married...

844
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:58,062
What are you doing here?
There is a stench of evil in this inn.

845
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:02,059
Quickly pack tip
and leave immediately!

846
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,402
Let's get your burial urn first!

847
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:08,399
Hurry up!

848
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,671
-I forgot the painting!
-Retrieve it after dawn!

849
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,581
Ling Choi San!

850
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,574
Today is a day of good fortune
for the underworld.

851
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:17,711
Siu Sihn must have been
kidnapped by them.

852
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,380
The old monster's come
to steal his bride?!

853
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,721
We have to force our way
into the underworld!

854
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,783
-We have to save Siu Sihn!
-Hold this!

855
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,784
We have the duration of a burning
incense stick to save Siu Sihn!

856
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,820
When dawn arrives,
we won't be able to return!

857
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,492
Remember to keep your eyes closed!

858
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,365
Prajna Pararnita!

859
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:37,395
Follow me!

860
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:47,808
Can I open my eyes yet?

861
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:51,809
If you don't open your eyes,
how are we supposed to find her?

862
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:14,834
Siu Sihn is inside.

863
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:17,368
Siu Sihn!

864
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:18,641
Ling Choi San!

865
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:22,640
Siu Sihn!

866
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:26,549
-How come I can't touch her?
-Ling Choi San!

867
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:28,523
Siu Sihn Siu Sihn!

868
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:31,515
In the mortal plane, people can't see ghosts.
In the spirit plane, ghosts can't see people.

869
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:32,652
Prajna Pararnita!

870
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:36,654
This way, Siu Sihn
will be able to see you! Lets go!

871
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:48,435
They have entered the underworld!

872
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:50,604
Leave quickly!

873
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:51,909
Siu Sihn!

874
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,403
What shall we do?

875
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:57,374
Run and hide!

876
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:02,915
-Hurry up and go save Ski Sihn!
-Me?

877
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,915
Go!

878
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:08,794
Prajna Paramita!

879
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:12,790
"Heaven and earth are inexhaustible,
a rite borrowed from heaven and earth!"

880
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,638
-Where am I?
-Forget me, leave now!

881
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,911
I've come to save you!

882
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,909
I'll help you chop off the iron chains!

883
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:42,452
Lets go!

884
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:50,661
Cops!
I¡¯ve bit off more than I can chew

885
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:56,166
Swordsman Yin!
Catch the sward

886
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:13,684
You two get out of here!
I'll follow!

887
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:55,559
We have to find another way out!

888
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,753
Prajna Pararnita!

889
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,728
-Swordsman Yin
-Why did you come back?!

890
01:28:28,737 --> 01:28:32,696
-We can't get out!
-The old monster has sealed the way out!

891
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:36,207
You won't be able to leave!

892
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:38,145
-Get my arrow!
-OK!

893
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,205
Pull the bow!

894
01:28:40,215 --> 01:28:41,876
Release the arrows!

895
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:45,876
Prajna Paramita!

896
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:50,214
We're no match for him!

897
01:28:57,399 --> 01:29:01,358
Hold on tight! He's a 1000-year old monster.
He'll steal your souls!

898
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:06,797
Swordsman Yin!

899
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:24,748
Don't loose concentration Recite the
Buddhist Sutras! Prajna Paramita!

900
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:29,393
Old lord of the Black Mountain
I beg you to release them!

901
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:33,390
I want you to break your burial urn so that
you stay with me in the underworld.

902
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,503
Siu Sihn! don't listen to him!

903
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,874
Don't get distracted!
Recite the Buddhist Sutras!

904
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:46,837
-Prajna Paramita, Prajna Paramita...
-Prajna Paramita, Prajna Paramita...

905
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:52,476
Don't!

906
01:29:55,457 --> 01:29:59,393
I'll come and save you!

907
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:12,562
Siu Sihn.

908
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:23,274
Siu Sihn.

909
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:29,847
Yin Chik Ha, Ling Choi San,
now you will die!

910
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:41,096
Don't!

911
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:45,129
What is this? Diamond Sutra?

912
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:53,271
You're been evil long enough!
Now I'm going to destroy you, old monster!

913
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,457
Damn old monster,
I guess you're finally willing to die!

914
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:15,596
Swordsman Yin!

915
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:19,596
The exit has been opened!
Take Swordsman Yin and leave now!

916
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:28,405
Swordsman Yin!

917
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:48,693
Swordsman Yin, we've returned
to the mortal world.

918
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:52,696
Darn! The sun's rising Siu Sihn's
been left behind! Quickly pull her out!

919
01:32:02,317 --> 01:32:06,310
Swordsman Yin! Quickly come
and give us a hand!

920
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:15,156
Siu Sihn!

921
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:17,529
don't let the sunlight touch her!

922
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:21,468
If the sunlight touches her, her soul
will disperse, and she won't reincarnate!

923
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:28,498
Siu Sihn, quickly go back
into your burial urn!

924
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:37,841
The sun has already risen. I now must
leave even though I don't want to.

925
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:44,514
Siu Sihn, you have to be a good mortal.
I shall always remember you!

926
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:51,525
I never thought I wouldn't be able to see
you one more time before we separated.

927
01:32:51,533 --> 01:32:55,526
You have to take care of yourself!

928
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:02,565
She's already left.

929
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,273
Don't allow the daylight..
-Siu Sihn

930
01:33:09,284 --> 01:33:13,243
To separate us

931
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:17,448
Don't let the long sweet night

932
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:19,555
Siu Sihn!

933
01:33:19,561 --> 01:33:23,554
Pass us by..

934
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:30,360
Siu Sihn! don't worry,
I'll definitely take you home.

935
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:59,296
I wonder if Siu Sihn has reincarnated
as a mortal yet?

936
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,259
As a mortal, you can't choose when
to be born. Its worse than being a ghost.

937
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,442
Look up there!

938
01:34:11,446 --> 01:34:15,405
Lets stall on our journey!

939
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:19,580
The road of life

940
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:23,580
The road to beautiful dreams
is a long one

941
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:28,352
The wind blows
and frost covers the road

942
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,631
In this mortal world

943
01:34:35,637 --> 01:34:39,630
How many different directions
can beautiful dreams take

944
01:34:40,642 --> 01:34:44,601
To find the love
one cannot stop dreaming of

945
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:49,939
The road
follows the man frantically

946
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:54,352
Mortal life is

947
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:58,382
Beautiful dreams
and passionate aspirations

948
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:02,119
Vaguely in one's dreams

949
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:06,123
A dim glimmer of fears

950
01:35:06,935 --> 01:35:10,928
Going from place to place

951
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:15,000
To find the direction
my heart wants to go

952
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:18,410
In the dream the wind seems
to sigh lightly once in a while

953
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:22,372
The road and the man are frantic

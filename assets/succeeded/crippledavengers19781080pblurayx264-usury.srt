00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,495
TIANDAO MANOR

3
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,040
You really heard
Du Tiandao wasn't home?

4
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,916
I'm certain of it.

5
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,507
Who dares break into Master Du
the Black Tiger's manor?

6
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,677
The Three Tigers of the South.
We are here for Du Tiandao.

7
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,938
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

8
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:06,525
"The chirping of songbirds fills the air
after a night of roaring wind and rain..."

9
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,626
This is Du Tiandao's wife.
And that's his son.

10
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,379
- Seize them.
- No, stop! Stop!

11
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,383
- No!
- Should we kill them?

12
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,929
I heard that Du Tiandao has a steward
called Wan skilled in martial arts.

13
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,390
- Why hasn't he shown himself?
- Perhaps he left with Du Tiandao.

14
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,976
Since we are here,
let's get it over with.

15
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:44,105
However, killing a defenseless woman
and child seems...

16
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,607
Du Tiandao thinks he's a great hero.

17
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:52,196
Let's use his wife and his precious son
to leave him a surprise.

18
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:56,617
Yes! Let's chop off his wife's legs
and his son's arms.

19
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,035
Very well.

20
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,290
Mother! Mother!

21
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,756
Father!

22
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,968
CHEN KUAN-TAI

23
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,850
- Du Tiandao?
- Are you the Three Tigers of the South?

24
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:25,813
You threaten women and children.
You don't deserve that name.

25
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,818
Each of you will die from one
of my Black Tiger's Three Styles.

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,407
Watch carefully,
this is "Black Tiger Emerges"!

27
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,954
Winged Tiger!

28
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,125
Windmill Style!

29
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,346
Steward Wan?

30
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,067
Father, Mother is dead.

31
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:18,741
Father, they cut off my arms,
but I did not beg them for mercy.

32
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,034
Good.

33
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,204
I will spare no expense
to hire skilled craftsmen

34
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,497
to build a pair of iron arms for you.

35
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,168
You will train in martial arts again
and become invincible.

36
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,760
LU FENG
(AS AN ADULT)

37
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,054
See? I did not lie to you.

38
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,891
I finally found an expert craftsman
to create a pair of iron arms

39
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,143
that can be controlled at will.

40
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,813
Yes, seven pairs in total
have been made,

41
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,776
but this pair works the best
and can even shoot concealed weapons.

42
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,119
I am known for my Black Tiger Fist Style.

43
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,413
- Practice it diligently.
- Yes.

44
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,579
Do you remember that I used each
of the Black Tiger's Three Styles

45
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:51,208
to kill the Three Tigers of the South?

46
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:56,005
The Black Tiger's Three Styles
is the essence of the Black Tiger Fist.

47
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,799
Let us see if you can unlock its power.

48
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,469
Black Tiger Emerges!

49
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,682
Winged Tiger!

50
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,144
Windmill Style!

51
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,995
These are the descendants
of the Three Tigers of the South.

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,707
I allowed them to grow up
and practice martial arts

53
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,584
before I captured them.

54
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,211
This is my son, Du Chang.

55
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,090
Your fathers cut off his arms
many years ago.

56
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,926
All of you are martial artists.

57
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,888
I will set you free
if you can defeat him.

58
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,890
I will not hunt you down.

59
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,142
I will not interfere in the fight.

60
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,687
Du Chang, I have already
avenged your mother

61
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,981
by killing the Three Tigers of the South.

62
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,442
They spared your life.

63
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:04,073
Therefore, you must just cripple
their descendants.

64
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,491
Yes.

65
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,911
- Now, untie them.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,581
Untie them.

67
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,209
The Three Tigers of the South
cut off my son's arms.

68
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,089
I will have each of their descendants
become cripples as well!

69
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:12,724
Although my son doesn't have arms,
he is still skilled at martial arts.

70
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,144
He's a natural.

71
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,820
There are plenty of people who deserve
to be crippled more than him!

72
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,116
LILU'S INN

73
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,578
Bring the meat over, quickly.

74
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,746
Please enjoy.

75
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,709
- This way, sir. Come this way.
- All right.

76
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,045
Have a seat.

77
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,215
PHILIP KWOK

78
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,138
What would you like?

79
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,056
- Some wine first.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,933
Master Du is here.

81
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,317
Sir, stand up. Quick, stand up.

82
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,737
Who is he?

83
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:10,824
The famous master of Tiandao Manor,
Master Du the Black Tiger.

84
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,993
And that is the young master.

85
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,287
And his steward Wan.

86
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,215
Master Du...

87
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,218
- Young Master Du.
- Young Master Du.

88
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,806
What is the matter with your hands?
Are you mocking him for having no arms?

89
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,433
What?

90
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,157
Calm down!

91
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,036
LO MENG

92
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,760
Hey, what's going on?
Why is that man so full of himself?

93
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,722
Do you have a death wish?
Those two are very lucky.

94
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,934
If Master Du had acted,
the result would've been much worse.

95
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,895
- Sir, have a seat.
- All right.

96
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,859
Master Du, we are sorry!

97
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,159
Hey! What has this world come to?

98
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,496
It's like people have seen a ghost
when they see those two!

99
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,833
Sir, sit down. Don't be angry.

100
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,964
Don't be angry.
Sit down.

101
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,886
Such tyrannical behavior
will be punished by Heaven!

102
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,638
Let's leave.

103
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,850
His wife was murdered
and his son's arms were chopped off.

104
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:05,897
So just because he knows martial arts,
he takes out his anger on other people!

105
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,941
What kind of man does that?

106
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,451
Others might fear you,
but I, Wei Datie, do not!

107
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,245
Innkeeper, bring me two jars of liquor!

108
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,977
Master, Young Master,
no need to be angry.

109
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,564
That lad's a blacksmith.
I know where his smithy is.

110
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:51,943
- We know where to find him.
- Heaven isn't blind after all.

111
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,738
That man delivered
a very satisfactory tongue-lashing.

112
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,075
Heaven is blind.

113
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,078
Master Du, that fellow is also blind.

114
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,915
Yes, you too are blind.

115
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,780
Master Du, he is a trader
from another town.

116
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,032
He doesn't understand...

117
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,915
- Your hands...
- I have no hands, and you have no eyes.

118
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,712
- So we're even.
- How do I not have eyes? I...

119
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,315
WEI DATIE'S SMITHY

120
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,068
A hit here and there,
and they were all down.

121
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,446
What is there to be afraid of, right?

122
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,575
Then what? What happened next?

123
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,788
Hey, I gave Du Tiandao and his son
a piece of my mind earlier.

124
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,500
- Aren't you afraid he'll give you trouble?
- I'm not afraid!

125
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,878
The worst that can happen
is that he'll kill me.

126
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:37,340
If nobody is afraid of him,
will he kill everyone?

127
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,342
- Steward Wan.
- Steward Wan.

128
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,639
Wei Datie,
Master Du has invited you over.

129
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:49,144
What for? Does he like
hearing me tell him off?

130
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,521
Will you accept or not?

131
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,816
I will if you ask me nicely.
Otherwise, no chance!

132
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,238
Wei Datie, do you think
you can win against Master Du?

133
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,867
- I'll fight him with all my might!
- Master Du won't fight you.

134
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,077
He is inviting you over for a drink.

135
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,956
- Didn't you say you aren't afraid of him?
- Of course I'm not afraid.

136
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,666
Let's go, then!

137
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,548
Datie is an honest fellow.
Steward Wan, please just spare him.

138
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,552
I'm not afraid of them.
It's no use begging them anyway.

139
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,012
Let's go.

140
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,313
I can walk on my own.
You'll regret it if you push me again.

141
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,119
I'm here. What do you want?

142
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,955
Do you like insulting others?

143
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,959
I don't insult people
unless they're tyrannical lowlifes.

144
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,592
Master Du is offering you a cup of wine.

145
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,973
- What's in the wine?
- A drug that will turn you mute.

146
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,892
You'll never be able
to curse others again. Drink it!

147
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,435
I refuse!

148
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,939
Du Tiandao, you have no morals!

149
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,824
Throw him out!

150
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,913
Du Tiandao, you are a cowardly bastard!

151
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,250
You will meet a tragic end!
Heaven will punish you!

152
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,962
Are you still talking?

153
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,012
THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL CURSE YOU

154
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,599
Very well.
The whole world can curse me.

155
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,144
You would love that.
Too bad you won't be able to hear it!

156
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:30,639
WEI DATIE'S SMITHY

157
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,036
- Wei Datie!
- Wei Datie, what happened?

158
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,497
- Tell us!
- Say something.

159
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,457
- Can you hear me?
- What's the matter?

160
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,794
- What happened?
- Why aren't you saying anything?

161
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,712
- Say something!
- Wei Datie?

162
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,508
Be careful.

163
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,600
Sir, I would let you stay,
but you have offended Master Du.

164
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,562
I am old and weak. I wouldn't dare...

165
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,733
I understand.

166
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,696
Oh, by the way, where does
that outspoken blacksmith live?

167
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,157
You had better leave.

168
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:36,079
They have turned Wei Datie
deaf and mute.

169
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,877
- You take care.
- Thank you, thank you.

170
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,213
Take care.

171
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,932
Careful!

172
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,731
Go slowly.

173
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,775
Thank you, thank you.

174
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,861
Be careful.

175
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,938
You... I am blind.
Are you also blind?

176
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,779
Are you mute?

177
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,579
You are also deaf?

178
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,416
You are Wei Datie!

179
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,563
Get lost! Leave now!

180
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,484
- I will hire another assistant!
- Fine, I will leave!

181
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,569
SUN CHIEN

182
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,947
Someone as harsh as you
will die a horrible death!

183
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,617
Someone as poor as you
deserves to starve to death!

184
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,581
I am an able-bodied man!
You will starve to death before I do!

185
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,087
Does being able-bodied mean you don't
have to look where you are going?

186
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,339
I was talking about myself, not you.

187
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,551
I didn't know you were behind me.
You weren't looking...

188
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,762
Du Chang, he isn't worth it.

189
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,473
Killing someone like him
is like killing a dog.

190
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,894
All right, I will let you vent your anger.
Tell me what you want from him.

191
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,524
He bumped into me.

192
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:14,237
He walks without taking care.

193
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,114
So chop off his legs.

194
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,786
Do it.

195
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,053
WEI DATIE'S SMITHY

196
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,493
Datie says not to be afraid.
He can support us.

197
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,081
We are all disabled.
What other option do we have?

198
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:14,214
So? How do you like life
as a deaf-mute?

199
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,057
Listen.

200
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,517
Whoever makes a purchase
from Wei Datie's shop

201
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,645
should fear for their life!

202
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,288
CHIANG SHANG

203
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,415
The blacksmith just went out of business.

204
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,585
I need a blade made.
Is there another blacksmith in town?

205
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,920
No.

206
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,547
Why did the blacksmith close?

207
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,342
This is strange.

208
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,095
I asked for directions
to the smithy on my way here.

209
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,848
How come everyone acted
as oddly as you're doing now?

210
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:10,228
Sir, you aren't from around here.
You don't understand the situation here.

211
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,729
The poor blacksmith...

212
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,578
Go away!

213
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,794
Which one of you is Wei Datie?

214
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,718
Run!

215
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,765
- I can't believe such a thing could happen.
- Thank you, sir.

216
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,479
You must not be from around here
since you helped us.

217
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,734
Is he the blacksmith?

218
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,450
Don't worry. I will avenge you,
and rid the world of this evil.

219
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,705
LILU'S INN

220
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,170
TIANDAO MANOR

221
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,928
Come out, Du Tiandao!

222
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,907
Are you Du Tiandao?

223
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,534
How dare you call Master Du
by his full name!

224
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,293
I am Du Tiandao.

225
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,214
How are you related
to the Three Tigers of the South?

226
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,841
The Three Tigers of the South?
My name is Wang Yi.

227
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,636
I've heard of your atrocities,
how you crippled innocent men.

228
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,138
I have come to rid the world of you!

229
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,183
Where did this insolent fool come from?

230
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,726
- Get him!
- Yes, sir!

231
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,680
Father, allow me.

232
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,993
Kill me if you must.
Someone will avenge me if I die.

233
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:45,461
Whatever torture you subject me to,
I won't so much as furrow my brow!

234
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,260
Du Tiandao, you terrorize innocent people
because your son lost his arms.

235
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,595
Heaven will punish you!

236
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,393
- What is your name?
- I already told you. My name is Wang Yi.

237
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,645
You remember your own name.

238
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,899
I'm not an idiot. Why wouldn't I
remember my own name?

239
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,279
Father, he said he wasn't an idiot.

240
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,491
- For now, he isn't.
- What? You...

241
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,249
Du Tiandao, you...

242
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,834
Sir, are you all right?

243
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,275
Hu Agui, what happened to him?

244
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,195
- Is he injured?
- I don't know.

245
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,119
Sir, are you...

246
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,163
"Sir, are you..."

247
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,209
WEI DATIE'S SMITHY

248
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,598
This is rather fun!

249
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,434
Sir, what is your name?

250
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,480
"Sir, what is your name?"

251
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:15,611
Hu Agui, this person is an idiot.
Do you have the wrong person?

252
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,280
You should recognize his voice.

253
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,827
- What is your name?
- This hero tried to avenge us.

254
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,747
He fell victim to Du Tiandao
and his son's cruelty.

255
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,332
This is fun!

256
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,962
I wonder what they did
to turn him into this.

257
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,923
This is boring.

258
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,811
Hey, what are you doing?

259
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:54,859
I'm searching him for anything
that can tell us who he is.

260
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,446
We are the reason
he's in this state now.

261
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,198
We should at least find a way
to notify his family.

262
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,750
TO THE MASTER OF YING MANOR

263
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,920
There's a letter addressed
to the master of Ying Manor.

264
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,011
The letter is for this man's master.

265
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,027
Hey, let me push it.

266
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,885
Master Wang, we are taking you
to your master.

267
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,805
- Will you stop playing around?
- Are you talking to me?

268
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,932
Come on. Let's get going.

269
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,575
What happened?

270
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,080
Master Wang still knows martial arts.
Datie was beaten.

271
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,668
It will take at least a week
to reach his master.

272
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,171
What... What will we do?

273
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,423
Let's get going!

274
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,252
WINE

275
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,368
- Attend to the customers.
- All right.

276
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,664
What would you like to order?

277
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,459
- What would you like?
- Anything will do. He's blind.

278
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,586
- Be quick.
- All right.

279
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,339
Throw it at him.

280
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,514
Let's go!

281
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,982
This is bad. We should leave.
There'll be trouble if their parents come.

282
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,400
Hey!

283
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,166
Hey! Who hurt my son?

284
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,043
- It was him!
- Show me!

285
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,421
- He hurt us!
- Let's have a look!

286
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,049
YING MANOR

287
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,435
I've been here before.

288
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,989
Come on.

289
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:20,374
Thank you for escorting
my apprentice here.

290
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,341
We are the reason why Master Wang
has ended up like this.

291
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:33,721
Fortunately, we found
a letter on him addressed to you.

292
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,015
That is how we found our way here.

293
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,019
Du Tiandao the Black Tiger rose to fame
with his Black Tiger Fist.

294
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,855
He is considered a great hero
in the martial arts world.

295
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,525
I cannot believe he could be so cruel.

296
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,911
Get up.

297
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,623
I know what you want.

298
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:05,294
However, it is hard enough
for ordinary people to learn martial arts.

299
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:07,296
The three of you are...

300
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:14,219
No matter how difficult it may be,
I will turn you all into martial artists!

301
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:18,218
Since you are blind,
you must see with your ears.

302
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,679
You will have to practice
the art of hearing,

303
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,182
until you can detect
the subtlest of sounds.

304
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,142
Listen carefully now.

305
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,794
Wei Datie is deaf.

306
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,716
I am writing on his palm
and teaching him how to train his eyes.

307
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,762
You can use this method
to communicate with him from now on.

308
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,030
Do not let him push you around.
Kick him.

309
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:47,075
- But I am indebted to Master Wang.
- Do not worry.

310
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,245
He may be out of his mind,
but he still knows martial arts.

311
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,081
You might not be able
to land a kick on him.

312
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,262
Come on, push me.

313
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:26,031
Be quick to lift your leg. Use your hips.
Do not let your upper body sway.

314
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,203
Chen Shun...

315
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,541
Your hearing has greatly improved.

316
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:42,881
The technique I am teaching you now
will help you react more quickly to sounds

317
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,009
and allow you to be victorious,
so let's begin.

318
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:13,096
I quit. You are pretending to be blind.
You're pretending.

319
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,017
Come.

320
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,602
Come here.

321
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:30,614
Go.

322
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,373
Hu Agui, you seem to have taught
Wang Yi a lesson.

323
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,126
I'm sorry about landing
three kicks on him yesterday.

324
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,587
Now he runs away at the sight of me.

325
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,981
Hey, are you really blind?

326
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,235
Hey, train with me tonight.

327
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:17,739
No! It really hurts when you kick me
with your iron legs.

328
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,894
- He's here.
- Let's go.

329
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:33,875
<i>This footwork technique
is most useful as a contingency</i>

330
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,587
<i>against a powerful opponent
such as Du Tiandao.</i>

331
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,715
<i>You are deaf and can't hear a thing.</i>

332
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,261
<i>You can defend yourself
in all directions with this technique.</i>

333
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,537
You're the most fun!

334
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:13,331
The other two
either kick me or hit me.

335
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,222
You've been here for three years.

336
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:01,564
During these three years, our bodies
were broken, but our spirits were not.

337
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,692
- Thank you for teaching us, Master.
- You are right...

338
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,947
A broken body can be fixed,
but a broken spirit cannot be fixed.

339
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:12,200
Du Tiandao may have all his limbs,

340
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:16,621
but his spirit is already
damaged beyond repair.

341
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:21,000
Master, do you think the three of us
can rid the world of that scourge?

342
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,505
Over three years, the three of you
have shown great perseverance.

343
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,465
You are ready.

344
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,349
Stand.

345
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,356
From what I have heard,

346
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:47,360
Du Tiandao and his son have become
even more vicious in recent years.

347
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,864
They have gathered many strong men
and committed many atrocious acts.

348
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,993
For you, victory is not assured.

349
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:57,120
You must be careful.

350
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:02,667
The Black Tiger's Three Styles are
the most lethal martial arts techniques.

351
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,545
You must first understand
Du's fighting style

352
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,297
before devising a plan of attack.

353
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,174
Only then, will you stand
a chance of winning.

354
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,342
- Yes.
- Yes.

355
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,302
That is what I have heard,

356
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:16,305
but you will have to see
whether it is true.

357
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:21,686
Although he has crippled you,
he did not take your lives.

358
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:25,773
You can go there separately
to reconnoiter the situation

359
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,234
before deciding what to do.

360
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,113
I have also heard that
he will invite many martial artists

361
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,533
to celebrate his 45th birthday.

362
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,161
It will be a good opportunity
for you to observe him.

363
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:43,708
However, do not harm anyone
unless you are in danger.

364
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,418
- Yes.
- Yes.

I will pretend to be a fortune-teller
and go first.

367
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,814
Wei Datie will be second.

368
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,737
Hu Agui will then come with Wang Yi.

369
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:19,160
Hu Agui and Wei Datie
will meet up at the smithy.

370
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:23,039
Wei Datie and I will meet up at the inn.

371
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:26,959
I will hang this banner
outside my room as a sign.

372
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:30,797
If I go out,
I will turn the banner around.

373
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,674
Everyone must arrive there
before Du Tiandao's birthday.

He's gone to purchase some things

Please have a seat.
Everyone, please have a seat.

Waiter, brew some fresh tea!
Have a seat.

- Use high-quality tea.
- Yes, sir.

- What would you like to order?

386
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,872
Why are you staring at me?

387
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,505
How did you know
I was staring at you?

388
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:50,811
Innkeeper, don't you think
that blind man looks familiar?

389
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,855
- That blind man over there?
- Yes.

390
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,568
He looks like the trader
who was blinded here three years ago.

391
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,445
- Yes.
- Go and warn him.

392
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,156
- Don't go dicing with death.
- All right.

393
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,331
Be careful.

394
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:13,918
Steward Wan of Tiandao Manor
is sitting over there with his men.

395
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,351
Gentlemen, would you like
to have your fortunes told?

396
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,104
Come here and tell me my fortune.

397
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:35,940
Blind man, sit down first.

398
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:37,775
All right.

399
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,055
Blind man, have some wine first.

400
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:27,950
There's no need to get up,
you'll be flat on your back soon.

401
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,009
Blind man,
where have I seen you before?

402
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,138
A noble man like Steward Wan
need not remember names.

403
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,932
Do you recollect what you said
three years ago?

404
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,020
"That fellow is also blind."

405
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,231
Yes, you are that trader!

406
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:05,154
You have a good memory, Steward Wan.
You weren't a noble to begin with anyway.

407
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,907
You are merely the head servant
at Tiandao Manor.

408
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,910
You must have a death wish!

409
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,885
Amazing. He's highly skilled.

410
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,939
Let's go!

411
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:32,950
There'll be trouble.

413

Master Luo, your skill is second to none
in the martial arts world.

414
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,562
You're too kind, Steward Wan.

415
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:06,692
These men have greatly improved
after training with you.

416
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:09,570
I would like to ask you

417
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,406
to take them with you
to deal with a certain matter.

418
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,158
Can you do that?

419
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:16,827
- Steward Wan, tell me what you need.
- Thank you.

420
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:23,209
A former enemy of Master Du
is staying at the inn now.

421
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:26,795
He is a blind man
and relies solely on his hearing.

422
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,966
Given your skill, you will surely
be able to capture him easily.

423
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,261
- Sure. When should I go?
- I think tomorrow would be good.

424
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,142
- Come on.
- Here, look.

425
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:44,271
- Well done!
- Amazing!

426
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:48,150
- Bullseye!
- Good job!

427
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:57,868
Steward Wan, even if the blind man
is a skilled martial artist,

428
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,745
he's no match for either of us.

429
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,790
Why don't you just teach him a lesson?

430
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,500
I am aware of that.

431
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:08,629
Even if he were up against you alone,
he would not necessarily win.

432
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:13,092
However, he would manage
to injure our men.

433
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,886
Then Master Du would find out.

434
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:19,890
The day after tomorrow is his birthday,
and I don't want to displease him.

435
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,643
So what are you planning?

436
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,396
It would be best
to take care of this quietly.

437
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:28,232
I believe that
with your martial arts skills,

438
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:33,195
combined with Master Lin
and his skill with projectile weapons,

439
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,240
dealing with the blind man will be easy.

440
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:38,033
Isn't that a better plan?

441
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,911
But is Master Lin willing?

442
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,122
Of course I am.

Innkeeper!

448
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,221
- Is that Wei Datie?
- Yes.

449
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,853
Wei Datie, are you looking
for the blind man?

450
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:10,524
He is staying here,
but he is out at the moment.

451
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:14,528
Wei Datie can't hear anything.

452
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,797
This way.

453
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,510
- Waiter, bring the bill!
- Coming!

454
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,728
- Steward Wan.
- Everybody out.

455
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:52,483
- And do not return for four hours.
- But Steward Wan...

456
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,653
- Leave!
- Get out!

457
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,803
Everybody, listen carefully.

458
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,516
When the blind man comes in,
do not move a muscle

459
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,643
or make a single sound.

460
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:31,689
He cannot see,
but his hearing is incredibly sharp.

461
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,817
He will surely return to his room.

462
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:38,112
When he reaches this spot,

463
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:40,864
Master Lin will first shoot him
from outside the window.

464
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,909
It would be best
if a single attack kills him.

465
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:49,248
But in case he manages to dodge it,
we all attack him at the same time.

466
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,501
If we catch him unawares,
we will surely succeed.

467
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,380
- Does everyone understand?
- Yes, sir.

468
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:59,174
Master Lin, please.

469
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,817
Master Du, there's a fighter
by the name of Ju outside.

470
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,652
Ah, very well.

471
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:22,573
He is my fellow apprentice.
This is his first visit.

472
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,199
Let's greet him.

473
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:29,705
Ju Gaofeng was my master's
last disciple.

474
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,541
He is skilled in martial arts
and gifted with astounding strength.

475
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:45,554
Go away.
Don't you see where you are? Get lost!

476
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,390
He's blind. How can he see?

477
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:52,060
Let him be.
Take pity on the crippled.

478
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,066
Ju Gaofeng!

479
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,612
Du Tiandao.

480
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,322
Go away.

481
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,409
- What's the matter?
- He's just a beggar.

482
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,453
Give him some money
and send him away.

483
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:10,662
Yes, sir.

484
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,166
This is my son.
His name is Du Chang.

485
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:17,127
- Greet Master Ju.
- Master Ju.

486
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,423
I came to wish you a happy birthday.

487
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,218
Thank you. Let's talk inside.

488
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:34,144
This is your first visit.
You must stay for a few days.

489
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,620
Withdraw!

490
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,058
That's very thoughtful of you.

491
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,978
Master Ju. He is Master Du's
fellow apprentice.

492
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,022
- Master Ju.
- This is Master Lin.

493
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,399
He is a renowned sharpshooter.

494
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,486
So you use concealed weapons.

495
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:51,448
With such a robust physique,
you must be incredibly strong.

496
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,868
You have no need
for projectile weapons.

497
01:05:55,827 --> 01:06:00,040
A real man is open and above board.
I use physical martial arts.

498
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:04,461
Do you mind showing me
a few moves to enlighten me?

499
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:08,465
Very well. You shoot pellets.
What other weapons do you use?

500
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:13,095
The two of you are guests.

501
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:18,183
If you want to show off your skills,
I shall be your sparring partner.

502
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,726
Fine.

503
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,812
What weapon will you use,
Steward Wan?

504
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,859
This meteor hammer.

505
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:30,237
I hope I don't make a fool of myself.

506
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:33,448
Your meteor hammer is one of a kind.

507
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:37,244
That chain is long and thick.
You must have a special technique.

508
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:40,080
Feel free to demonstrate
and don't hold back.

509
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,207
Just hit me.

510
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,213
All right. Master Ju, it is an honor.

511
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,774
He's so strong!

512
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,527
My apologies.

513
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:19,578
He's very condescending,
just because he knows some martial arts.

514
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,580
He'll be taught a lesson one day.

515
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,498
He is Master Du's friend.

516
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,835
Out of respect for Master Du,
we cannot touch him.

517
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,589
Huh? Where's Luo Bao?

518
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:35,802
When you held him back
from fighting those two earlier,

519
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,804
he seemed displeased.

520
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,182
He might've gone after them
by himself.

521
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,896
Find Master Luo and ask him to return.

522
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,315
- Tell him I need to speak with him.
- Yes, sir.

523
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:51,860
Tomorrow is Master Du's birthday.

524
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,613
I don't want any trouble.

525
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:58,533
- I want to play.
- I want this one.

526
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:02,954
- Give it to me.
- I win!

527
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,166
- I got it!
- Come and play marbles with me!

528
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:10,128
- I'm done playing!
- Don't leave! Play marbles with me!

529
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,379
Don't run off!

530
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,507
LILU'S INN

531
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,272
WEI DATIE'S SMITHY

532
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,329
You... you...

533
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,888
Steward Wan, it's Master Luo...

534
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,683
- Who did it?
- Wei Datie.

535
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,518
Master Luo tried to ambush him,

536
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:34,356
but Wei Datie was wearing a mirror
around his neck and saw him.

537
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,860
He is deaf and can't hear someone
sneaking up on him.

538
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,154
That is why he wears a mirror.

539
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:44,824
- Very clever.
- What do we do now?

540
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,660
I'd held Luo Bao back.

541
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,538
I wanted to get this done quietly.

542
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:55,335
I didn't want to make a big deal of this
with Master Du's birthday coming up.

543
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:58,171
- Little did I know...
- So...

544
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,132
Now this has happened to Luo Bao,

545
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,718
we won't be able to keep it
from Master Du.

546
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:09,891
We will have to get rid of those two
before Master Du's birthday tomorrow.

547
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:14,646
- Then we can report to him.
- Let's hurry back and gather some men.

548
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:19,442
We'll get rid of these two men tonight.
We can't play it safe again this time.

549
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:24,698
Unfortunately, Ju Gaofeng snapped
the chain of my meteor hammer.

550
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:27,534
I wonder if he's fixed it yet.

551
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,203
- Where's Wei Datie?
- He returned to the inn.

552
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,043
That's what we will do...

553
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,221
LILU'S INN

554
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,064
- Master Ju.
- What's going on?

555
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,276
Is Steward Wan angry
that I broke his meteor hammer?

556
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,777
Of course not.

557
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:06,156
Two of Master Du's former enemies
are at the town's inn.

558
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:08,074
Steward Wan wanted to use this,

559
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,577
but we've been busy the past few days
and forgot to fix it.

560
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:14,039
- And where is this inn?
- It's the only one in town.

561
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:16,624
When you reach the main street,
you can't miss it.

562
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,939
Put out the candles.

563
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,449
Stop!

564
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,710
The deaf man won't be able to see
without candles,

565
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:52,465
but did it occur to you that
you won't be able to see either?

566
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,803
You wanted to attack
under the cover of darkness,

567
01:15:56,928 --> 01:16:01,808
but you forgot one thing:
blind men aren't afraid of the dark.

568
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:08,147
Get out, you useless bunch.
You'll only get in the way.

569
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:11,192
Watch me deal
with these two cripples by myself.

570
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,528
Just make sure nobody escapes.

571
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,629
They gathered so many men
to deal with two cripples.

572
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,673
What an embarrassment!

573
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,259
I can give you an advantage

574
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:39,887
so people won't say
that I bullied two cripples.

575
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,432
I won't move from this spot.

576
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:45,560
I will allow each of you
three punches and three kicks.

577
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,021
Then I will counter
three punches and three kicks.

578
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,523
If you manage to make me fall over,

579
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:54,861
then you have my word that
Master Du will not bother you again.

580
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,822
But if you fail to make me fall over

581
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,325
and do not survive
my three punches and three kicks...

582
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,078
...then consider yourself out of luck.

583
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:08,916
- What do you say?
- You have a deal.

584
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:44,887
Now it is my turn.
Who will take my three punches first?

585
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:48,266
Wait!

586
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:59,569
The three of us are friends
who will live and die together.

587
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:03,740
Will you take my three punches
and three kicks before fighting back?

588
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:05,867
Very well.

589
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:16,669
Hey, big guy, don't fall for it.
His legs are made of iron!

590
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:22,383
Yes. He just took
Wei Datie's iron fists.

591
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,719
Now it's time for him
to experience iron legs.

592
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:29,849
Many people in the martial arts world
claim to have iron fists and iron legs.

593
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,518
But they are nothing special.
Come on.

594
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,486
Aren't you embarrassed,
delivering punches like that?

595
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:45,656
- Come on. Try with your iron legs.
- His legs really are...

596
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:56,793
Your legs really are made of iron?

597
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,715
A worthy opponent!

598
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,095
He truly was a formidable martial artist.

599
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:54,016
If he had known your legs really were
made of iron, I fear we would have...

600
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:57,520
The boy nearly let the cat out of the bag.
Luckily, your comment fooled him.

601
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:03,651
By the way, you and the boy
should hide in the room.

602
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:07,321
Nobody knows that you have iron legs.
It will be a useful advantage.

603
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,419
Get inside.

604
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,061
He's dead.

605
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,457
He was a good man.

606
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:04,629
Pity that he made friends with bullies
like you and met this end.

607
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:09,133
Out of respect to him,
I will let you take his body.

608
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,385
Be quick about it and leave.

609
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,695
After years with me, you should know
how to handle such difficult situations.

610
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,739
How did you let things end up like this?

611
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,367
Since your birthday is coming up,

612
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:38,537
I wanted to handle things quietly
without bothering you.

613
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:41,248
- I thought...
- Forget it.

614
01:22:41,374 --> 01:22:44,502
What is done is done.
There's no point in discussing it further.

615
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,004
I will personally deal
with those two tomorrow.

616
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:51,008
- But tomorrow is...
- I know what tomorrow is.

617
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:54,470
I will kill those two first,
then return to entertain my guests.

618
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:15,282
Wei Datie saw Du Tiandao and Du Chang
heading here with a gang of men.

619
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:19,870
Take Wang Yi and leave out the back.
Don't let them see you.

620
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:22,748
- We'll meet up at the smithy.
- We should leave together.

621
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,835
We didn't know any martial arts
in our past.

622
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:30,297
We know nothing about Du Tiandao's
and his son's martial arts skills.

623
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:33,009
Wei Datie is only
testing the waters today.

624
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:35,553
We're not ready for the final attack.

625
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:39,015
It's best not to let them know
about your iron legs just yet.

626
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,143
- Come with me!
- I'm not leaving.

627
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:45,855
If you're not going,
we'll leave you here.

628
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:55,614
Hurry and go. Just leave him.

629
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,340
Who are you?

630
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:59,136
Where are the blind man
and the mute?

631
01:25:01,055 --> 01:25:03,265
The blind man and the mute?

632
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,976
I'm not telling you!

633
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:10,731
Father, he's the one who came
to avenge them three years ago.

634
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:15,528
We injured his head.
He's probably...

635
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:17,655
Capture him first.

636
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,201
Come on.

637
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:26,247
Come on.

638
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,547
He acts like an idiot,
but he still knows martial arts.

639
01:25:34,672 --> 01:25:35,798
Be careful.

640
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:37,341
Du Chang...

641
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:41,887
He seems to be retarded,
there's no need to kill him.

642
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:54,608
What's with your hands?

643
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,659
Are those iron hands?
They hurt!

644
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:05,661
They're just like Hu Agui's...

645
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:17,047
He has iron hands.
Don't go head-to-head with him.

646
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:29,143
I have heard
of Master Du the Black Tiger.

647
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:33,022
We knew no martial arts before,
and didn't know who we were up against.

648
01:26:33,147 --> 01:26:37,484
Today, we would like to experience
Master Du's Black Tiger's Three Styles.

649
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:42,948
- You two aren't qualified.
- Our master's name is Li Zhengying.

650
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:46,869
We are his humble disciples.

651
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:53,626
Wang Yi, our fellow disciple,
was injured by you three years ago.

652
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:59,089
Today, we ask to duel with you

653
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:02,843
to test whether
we have learned any skills.

654
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:07,139
Very well. So the idiot
is Li Zhengying's disciple?

655
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,600
You are all his disciples?

656
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:12,728
Then let's see how powerful
his martial arts are.

657
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:28,077
Watch out.
This is "Black Tiger Emerges".

658
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:32,331
Winged Tiger!

659
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:34,625
Windmill Style!

660
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:46,262
Hey, wait for me!

661
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,777
Let them go!

662
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:04,238
Our guests will be arriving,

663
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:06,657
we must return to the manor
to receive them.

664
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:12,371
Since they seek revenge,
they won't be going anywhere.

665
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,961
You are right, Master Du.

666
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,088
Today is your birthday.

667
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:23,674
Even if they don't come to us,

668
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,136
we'll be able to find them
as long as they're in town.

669
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,978
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Boarding up the door.

670
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:39,023
Hey! Are you leaving me outside?
You can't!

671
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:40,691
Stop fooling around.

672
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,235
Even if we board up the door,
it makes no difference.

673
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,239
Du Tiandao knows we will be here
because we have nowhere else to go.

674
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:48,490
Then we should...

675
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:50,826
I don't think he'll come
looking for us right now.

676
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:53,495
Why is that?

677
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,124
Du Tiandao is ambitious and wants
to dominate the martial arts world.

678
01:28:57,249 --> 01:29:00,461
He has invited guests from far and wide
to his birthday celebration.

679
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:02,338
His reputation is important to him.

680
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:06,258
He wouldn't miss the party
to go after a few insignificant cripples.

681
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,218
His guests would mock him.

682
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:11,347
He's probably guessed that
we can't escape. Nor shall we.

683
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:16,477
- He can still come after us later.
- So how do we deal with him?

684
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,983
Of course, there'll be a way.

685
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,402
Rather than wait for them
to come after us,

686
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:29,406
we should ambush them early in the morning
after they've had a long night.

687
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,533
LONGEVITY

688
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:46,256
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

689
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:48,884
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

690
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,598
- Cheers!
- Thank you! Have a seat.

691
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:26,713
- Let's go.
- All right. I'll be right behind you.

692
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:45,149
Steward Wan, they've left the smithy
and are on their way here!

693
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:51,989
They're here.

694
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:54,199
Everybody, get ready!

695
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:05,502
Open the door.

696
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,391
Run!

697
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:12,689
Good! Very good!

698
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:40,092
Amazing!

699
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:41,069
Wang Yi didn't follow us here.

700
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:45,490
<i>Remember,
keep Du Tiandao occupied.</i>

701
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:48,452
<i>Use what our Master taught you.
Do not fight him head-to-head.</i>

702
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:51,997
<i>Once we have eliminated Du Chang,
we will fight him together.</i>

703
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,787
Playing alone is no fun.

704
01:38:37,913 --> 01:38:39,873
Hey, I should find Chen Shun!

705
01:38:40,624 --> 01:38:42,292
Chen Shun! Chen Shun!

706
01:38:51,718 --> 01:38:53,136
Chen Shun!

707
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:21,498
Play with me too!

708
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,260
Come on.

709
01:43:04,179 --> 01:43:07,515
His iron hands hurt me really badly!

710
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:41,878
Your legs are...

711
01:45:54,307 --> 01:45:56,476
- Du Tiandao?
- Dead.

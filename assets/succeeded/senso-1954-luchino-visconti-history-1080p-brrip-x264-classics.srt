1
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,430
Venice
- Spring 1866

2
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,809
The last months of
Austrian rule in Venetia.

3
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,979
The ltalian government has
allied itself to Prussia

4
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,525
and the war of
liberation is imminent.

5
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,161
Foreigners out of Venice!

6
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,962
General La Marmora has
mobilised the army!

7
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,507
Long live La Marmora! Viva ltalia!

8
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,676
Viva ltalia!

9
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,160
Where are the
stewards? This is a disgrace!

10
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,079
Please go and see, General.

11
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,333
lf this continues, we'll have no
choice but to evacuate the theatre.

12
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,086
Please go and see, General!

13
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,364
How amusing. This is the kind
of war the ltalians prefer.

14
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,576
A shower of confetti to an
accompaniment of mandolins.

15
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,580
Coward! You're a coward!

16
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,875
l'm ready to prove that the
ltalians want to fight!

17
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,836
And if you are a gentleman...

18
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,556
Let me go! You have no
right to lay hands on me!

19
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,727
Viva ltalia! Power
to the ltalian Army!

20
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,165
- Where are you going?
- To the foyer. lt's terribly hot here.

21
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,167
l don't think this is the best time.

22
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,128
Leave me alone. You know
l always do as l please.

23
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,465
Even so, l won't allow
you to wear these flowers.

24
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,262
lt all began that evening.

25
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,848
lt was the 27th of May.

26
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,559
My cousin, Roberto Ussoni,

27
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,188
who'd been among the
organisers of this demonstration,

28
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:43,110
was also an important figure in the
Venetian underground movement.

29
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,321
l was terribly worried
he'd endangered himself

30
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,783
by challenging that officer.

31
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,578
l was already thinking
of ways to help him.

32
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,670
Roberto.

33
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,879
Livia.

34
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,467
lt was madness to expose
yourself like this.

35
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,720
You shouldn't have done it.

36
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,766
All l know is that l lost my
head. When that cad said those words...

37
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,019
- What will you do now?
- He has accepted my challenge.

38
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,563
At least, so it seems.

39
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,983
- We'll fight a duel.
- No, you mustn't!

40
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,527
To take on an
officer, in your position...

41
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,821
the consequences would be so...

42
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,739
Something must be done. Leave!

43
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,868
You must get out of
this theatre right away.

44
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,704
Go home.

45
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,582
Go there or to
Marsenza's, wherever you want...

46
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,042
Wait for me to get word to you.

47
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,631
l beg of you, Roberto, you must
be careful for everyone's sake!

48
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,344
l know. Don't worry.

49
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,514
But did you see?
They rose up tonight.

50
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,058
There's still a lot to
do, but they're stirring.

51
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,061
Let's go, Roberto. We'll
go by way of the pier.

52
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,356
- Farewell, Roberto. Go!
- Farewell, Livia.

53
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,108
- Go!
- See you soon.

54
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:13,909
This is La Marmora's statement. We
haven't published it in the newspapers.

55
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,077
lt's utter nonsense.

56
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,747
And it would only further
agitate the Venetians.

57
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:24,127
There are still people here who don't
think much of him and his provocations.

58
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,715
We are truly sorry to have
halted the performance, dear Count,

59
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:33,428
but we cannot allow La Fenice
to become a hotbed of sedition.

60
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,680
l wholeheartedly agree.

61
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,393
But please believe me, this must
be the work of some agent provocateur.

62
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:45,899
- There can be no doubt about that.
- Of course. lt has been a delightful evening.

63
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,536
Ah, Countess Serpieri.

64
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,664
There is going to
be a duel. l mean it.

65
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,377
They've challenged Franz Mahler.

66
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,965
Maybe they wish to recreate the
battle between the Horatii and Curiatii.

67
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,969
You are very close to the man who
made the challenge, Countess.

68
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,722
Please, Your Excellency, let us not
dwell on this unfortunate incident.

69
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,767
That young man is a distant
relative, but we never see him.

70
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,436
Aren't relatives the
people we all know least?

71
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,730
l know him very well.

72
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,443
This will be no battle between
the Horatii and Curiatii.

73
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,280
My cousin isn't
interested in politics.

74
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,074
He is completely apathetic...

75
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,285
when it comes to this
kind of thing, l mean.

76
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,370
He must have had other reasons.

77
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,124
That Lieutenant Mahler...

78
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,794
l have heard a lot about him.

79
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,337
This doesn't surprise me.

80
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,841
All the ladies in
Venice are talking about him.

81
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,511
There you are, the ladies
must have spoken of him.

82
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,931
That's how so many stories
are made up. lsn't that right?

83
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,894
ls this an officer under
your command, Your Excellency?

84
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,689
- Mahler? Of course.
- Yes, he is.

85
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,609
l would love to meet him.

86
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,778
Given that all the Venetian
ladies are talking about him,

87
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,197
l'd love to be able
to speak with him too.

88
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:20,535
Countess, this is a favour you
shouldn't request from one of your admirers.

89
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,955
Lieutenant Mahler is far
too dangerous a rival.

90
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,298
- Would you care to sit down?
- No, thank you, Your Excellency.

91
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,717
This isn't the first
time l've seen ll Trovatore.

92
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:41,264
Besides, Austrians love music.

93
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,101
We ltalians, on the other hand, come
to the theatre for very different reasons.

94
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,114
We have arrived;

95
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:04,412
There's the tower where the
State's prisoners languish.

96
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,961
Ah, the hapless man
was brought here!

97
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,049
Go...leave me,

98
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:20,720
and don't fear for me.

99
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:26,518
l can save him, perhaps

100
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,575
Fear for me?

101
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:47,664
Sure and ready is my protection.

102
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,762
- Shrouded in this dark night...
- Countess, Lieutenant Mahler.

103
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,681
Countess Serpieri.

104
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:09,728
l'm near you, and you don't know it.

105
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,606
- Would you care to sit down?
- Thank you.

106
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,113
Moaning wind,

107
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,409
you who blow here.

108
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,371
- Do you have a good view?
- lt's fine, thank you.

109
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,042
Do you like opera,
Lieutenant Mahler?

110
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,338
l am very fond of
opera, Countess Serpieri,

111
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,674
as long as l am fond of
that particular opera.

112
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,051
And you?

113
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,137
l'm very fond of it.

114
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,893
l simply dislike it taking
place off the stage.

115
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,066
l dislike it when
people act melodramatically

116
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:01,112
without considering
the serious consequences

117
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,989
of an impulsive action,

118
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,368
or of an action dictated by
unforgivable thoughtlessness.

119
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,920
May l speak to you very truthfully?

120
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,547
Please.

121
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,175
Honesty is the one
thing l appreciate.

122
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,848
lf l've heard aright...

123
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,477
a duel should take place
tomorrow. lsn't that so?

124
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,566
And it's up to you to accept or to
refuse this challenge - isn't that so?

125
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,278
l wish to know.

126
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,489
l wish to know as well.

127
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,787
Don't accept the challenge.

128
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,498
lt isn't right to
risk one's life for...

129
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,292
Why are you so
concerned about my life?

130
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,963
lt's a matter of principle.

131
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,299
Don't worry.

132
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07,637
Neither my life nor your
principles are at any risk.

133
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:14,269
This foolish incident will
soon be dealt with by an arrest.

134
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,522
What do you mean?

135
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:27,657
..waken in him the memories...

136
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,538
What wonderful music.

137
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,709
Will you return tomorrow evening?

138
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,879
lf you'd allow me to...

139
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,507
l don't feel well.

140
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,759
l must go.

141
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,973
Please, don't move.

142
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,767
Good night, Your Excellency.

143
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,354
- Are you depriving us of you company?
- l don't feel well.

144
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,481
l'm so sorry.

145
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,317
Good night.

146
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,071
- Let's go.
- lf you don't feel well, we should wait a while.

147
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,616
- l said, let's go.
- As you wish.

148
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,456
Good bye! Why so soon?
Won't you come with us?

149
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,970
Your Excellency. Colonel.

150
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,748
They arrested Roberto as
soon as he left La Fenice.

151
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,625
That's impossible!

152
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,087
He was with Don? and
Meneghini. All three have been arrested.

153
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,674
We must do something, immediately.

154
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,345
Why don't you tell your
husband about it?

155
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,889
- lf he'll only look into it...
- Leave it up to me.

156
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,769
Go to Marsenza's.
l'll send you word.

157
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,897
But leave now. Don't take any risks.

158
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,483
- Good night.
- Good night.

159
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,448
Did you hear? They've
arrested Roberto.

160
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,790
Listen, l've never
asked anything from you,

161
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,585
but this time you have to
do something to free Roberto.

162
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,048
You can do this. You have
influence, you know people.

163
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,387
l'm sure that
lieutenant must have reported him.

164
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,806
- He didn't want to fight.
- Fair enough.

165
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,976
Why would an Austrian
officer fight an ltalian civilian?

166
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,978
lt would be absurd.

167
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,898
lf your cousin had a
modicum of good sense...

168
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,234
Can't you see what
the outcome might be?

169
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,988
Yes, l do. And l want nothing
to do with this matter.

170
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,115
They were right to arrest him.

171
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,952
And you'd like to involve me in
matters that don't concern me in the least?

172
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,539
l've had it. Don't mention
this to me again, do you understand?

173
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,210
lt's childish tomfoolery! What do you
all think you'll achieve, anyway?

174
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,759
Roberto was sent into exile for
a year, along with many others.

175
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:39,098
l had a strange foreboding about
what his departure would mean...for me.

176
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,019
Farewell.

177
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,522
l hope to see you
soon, my guardian angel.

178
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,819
Go to Aldeno as soon as you
can. Please tell Cavalletto.

179
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,697
We need secure lines
of communication.

180
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,532
l hope to come back soon.

181
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,578
Garibaldi is in Desenzano. Just
think, Livia, the time is nigh.

182
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,331
May we meet again as ltalians!

183
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,795
Roberto, take care.

184
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,568
But when l saw that officer again,

185
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:37,115
l understood that he was at
the root of all my fears,

186
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:42,120
and that for many days l'd been
apprehending a possible meeting.

187
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,871
Countess Serpieri.

188
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,668
What do you want?

189
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,881
- May l escort you?
- No, thank you, Lieutenant Mahler.

190
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,926
But there's a curfew
and it's already late.

191
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,597
Would you have me arrested because
l'm still walking about?

192
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,561
l've never had anyone
arrested over so little.

193
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,730
What do you think about
Roberto Ussoni's arrest?

194
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:16,320
Oh, so he's been arrested? l thought he was only
asked to go for a change of air for a while.

195
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,615
They sent him into exile,
as you know perfectly well.

196
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,370
You believe it's my
fault, but you're wrong.

197
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,747
l hope you believe me.

198
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,293
Besides, Ussoni will be pleased.

199
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,755
He was born to sacrifice
himself for a noble cause.

200
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,468
- And what were you born to do?
- To be what l am.

201
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,805
To be what you are... Good night.

202
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,022
Wouldn't it have been better if
you'd told me that first evening

203
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,232
that Ussoni was your lover,

204
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,111
and that you hoped l'd do
anything to keep him in Venice?

205
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,740
A true gentleman.

206
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,494
would not take advantage of the
fact that l'm alone to insult me.

207
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,497
- l have asked you not to follow me.
- But l'm not following you.

208
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,049
- So you're not following me?
- Consider me your shadow.

209
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,887
- Thank you, but mine will be enough.
- Mine will protect you much better.

210
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,974
Look, don't follow me!

211
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,244
- ls he dead?
- Yes.

212
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,252
How did it happen?

213
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,886
Come, quickly.

214
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,524
- What's this?
- Go and look.

215
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:06,032
He's dead! Quick, take him
away. Two men over here.

216
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,993
These damned Venetians. Every
night, they kill someone.

217
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,330
Go! Take him away! One either end.

218
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,998
Quick, quick!

219
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,544
Poor wretch. l knew him. He hadn't
been long in the Eighth Company.

220
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,643
Thank you.

221
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,272
You see,

222
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,027
it isn't very pleasant to be
part of an army of occupation.

223
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,447
You have to live among
men who hate you.

224
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:52,995
And since we're young, far
away from home, alone...

225
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:58,167
we end up courting their
wives, their girlfriends, and...

226
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,503
Yes, l understand.

227
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,007
Good night, Lieutenant.
l'm not afraid any more.

228
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:10,096
Please don't bother to walk me home.

229
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,472
Good night.

230
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,863
But there's
something l'd like you to know.

231
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,164
Roberto Ussoni is not my lover.

232
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,000
He's my cousin.

233
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,629
And he's the man l
admire most in the world.

234
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,174
Do you admire him more
than your husband?

235
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,139
My husband and l

236
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,392
have very different views
regarding the Austrians.

237
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,856
He's prepared to accept them, and
is willing to accept favours from them.

238
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,317
l'm like my cousin,

239
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,069
a true ltalian.

240
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,029
Good night.

241
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,700
Countess Serpieri.

242
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,333
We walked for a long time, together,

243
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,378
through the deserted streets.

244
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,882
My preconceptions had vanished.

245
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,968
Time stood still.

246
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:36,849
All that remained was
the hidden pleasure

247
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,936
of hearing him talk,
of hearing him laugh.

248
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:47,359
of listening to the sound of
our steps, in that silent city.

249
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,823
- Where are we going?
- Wherever you'd like.

250
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,535
l don't even know where we are.

251
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,875
- We've arrived somewhere.
- That's my house.

252
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,252
That's where l live.

253
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,421
Alone?

254
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,009
No, not alone, with other officers.

255
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,847
We often sit around in our
shirtsleeves, drinking beer, talking about women.

256
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,143
- But everything's about to change.
- Why?

257
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,270
Because l've met you.

258
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,696
- What have you found?
- A piece of broken mirror.

259
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,039
Why are you looking
at yourself so closely?

260
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,041
Are you that taken with yourself?

261
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:49,338
Yes. l never pass before a
mirror without looking at myself.

262
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,341
Why is that?

263
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,761
l like to look at
myself to make sure l am...

264
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,722
me!

265
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,142
ls that the only
way you can be sure?

266
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,563
Also when l see a woman

267
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,774
who is looking at me the way you're
looking at me right now.

268
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,281
''lt is Judgement Day

269
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,658
''the dead rise again...

270
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,327
''to eternal joy...

271
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,413
''or eternal suffering.

272
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,292
''And we remain in an embrace

273
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,921
''and nothing matters to
us, neither Heaven, nor Hell.''

274
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,883
- Do you like these verses by Heine?
- No.

275
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:40,347
- Why not?
- l don't like their meaning.

276
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,350
What a shame.

277
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,477
But with war about to break out...

278
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,438
You think there will be a war?

279
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,317
Yes. However strange it may be

280
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:55,696
that people will die over
matters that don't concern them.

281
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,491
Do you believe in war?

282
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:06,206
l believe that a country's
freedom should be defended

283
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,833
even if it costs you
your freedom or your life.

284
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,879
And so we shall be enemies?

285
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,262
l don't believe that.

286
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:26,477
l suppose it is a failing of mine

287
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:31,398
that l've never been
interested in war, in politics,

288
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,318
in the loss or gain of territory,

289
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:39,990
in all those terribly serious matters
for which men ought to be ready to die.

290
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,745
You see, l believe that even if one
man was born on this side of a river

291
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,792
and another man on the
other side of a mountain,

292
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:54,672
it doesn't mean God put the rivers and
mountains there to keep them apart.

293
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,758
You talk like a child.

294
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:02,012
How can you be a military
man when you hold such opinions?

295
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,183
lt seems absurd that
you're an officer.

296
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,646
Yes, l agree with you.

297
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,275
Everything's quite absurd.

298
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,116
l must go now. lt's almost dawn.

299
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,663
- Livia, that's your name, isn't it?
- Yes.

300
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,333
When can l see you again? Tomorrow?

301
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,752
No, that's impossible.

302
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,838
l'll wait for you.

303
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:52,479
By now it was dawn. The city
was coming to life again.

304
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:58,068
And l was beginning
to feel almost ashamed.

305
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:05,033
How could l have spent the
whole night with a stranger,

306
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,619
an Austrian officer?

307
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,082
l was an ltalian
woman, a married woman,

308
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,545
a woman who had never behaved
frivolously in her life.

309
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,179
And yet, four days later,

310
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,393
four days spent in the
vain hope of meeting him,

311
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,397
I was going to him.

312
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:00,672
l had managed to persuade myself
that he alone could help Roberto.

313
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,592
lt was my duty to ask him.

314
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,044
Not bad, eh?

315
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,104
Do you want a game?

316
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,139
l've been waiting for days...

317
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,725
and you've finally come.

318
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,710
Let us not bother
with heaven and hell.

319
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,728
From that day on, we often met.

320
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:25,692
We would go to a rented room that
Franz had found in the Fondamenta Nuove.

321
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,778
You see,

322
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,407
in these rooms, there is
always some little noise.

323
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:39,331
The swish of a curtain, a fly
banging against the window..

324
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,795
Had you ever noticed that?

325
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,214
No, Franz.

326
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,553
One notices it only
later, as a memory.

327
00:32:55,181 --> 00:33:00,268
Only then does one remember having
heard it while in an embrace.

328
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,397
ls that so, Franz?

329
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,609
Later, you realise that
you'd heard it all along,

330
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,945
without paying attention.

331
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,114
But later...

332
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,832
this tiny detail becomes important.

333
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:28,046
Can a detail be that important?

334
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:33,010
lt's the sense of
adventure. lt's as important as...

335
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,137
As what?

336
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,724
The colour,

337
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:44,021
the scent of your soft
hair on the pillow.

338
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,155
Had you never noticed this, my love?

339
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,617
No, Franz, not until now.

340
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,746
l keep forgetting...

341
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,540
What?

342
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:10,547
l keep forgetting that the past doesn't
exist for Countess Serpieri.

343
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,719
There is only the
present, and the future.

344
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,764
Only the present, Franz.

345
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,185
Only today? Not tomorrow?

346
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,323
- Will you hand me that hairbrush?
- Yes.

347
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,333
You see, if they told me that
there would be no tomorrow for me,

348
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:51,338
that tomorrow would never
come... after a moment like this...

349
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,343
l would feel as if
a doctor had told me,

350
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,261
''You are about to die.

351
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,516
''You only have a few hours left.''

352
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,651
And now l know it's true.

353
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,284
lt is just now, just now,
Franz. There is no tomorrow.

354
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,831
Every time you leave, you say,

355
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:31,586
''Farewell, Franz, 'we
will never meet again''.

356
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,881
But each time, l wait for you with the
same confidence that you'll return.

357
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,470
You may think you will never see me again,
but l'll keep waiting for you.!

358
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,227
Maybe you will.

359
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,990
But you've had so many love affairs,

360
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,411
during which the room
was filled with sounds,

361
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,497
with the noise of a fly
banging against a window,

362
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,418
which you only noticed later on.

363
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,963
So you got up

364
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,758
and you gave that poor
insect its freedom,

365
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,429
with the same elegance with which you
freed yourself from the woman's heart.

366
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,225
But don't worry,

367
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,646
when it comes to us

368
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,233
you won't even have to
make that small effort.

369
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,570
l'll do it for you, Franz.

370
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,117
l'll get up, l'll open the window,

371
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,956
and l'll let your heart fly
out, as free as a butterfly.

372
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,294
Would you give me
those hairpins, please?

373
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,216
l will no longer be
acting as your maid.

374
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,677
You will have to get
your own hairpins.

375
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,522
Franz, remember me by this.

376
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,279
What a splendid medallion.

377
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,157
Keep it by your heart.

378
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,371
l'm leaving now.

379
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,749
l'm leaving.

380
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,794
Farewell.

381
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,088
Farewell.

382
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,846
Franz...

383
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,558
- Would you let me leave like this?
- No, my love...

384
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,312
l knew you wouldn't go.

385
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,697
One afternoon,

386
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,783
while l waited for him
in vain in that room,

387
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,536
l realised for the first time

388
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:56,124
that l wasn't in control of my
feelings, as l'd always believed.

389
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,172
l must go out, and
no one else is home.

390
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,383
Shall l leave the door
ajar or will you answer it?

391
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:09,304
Are you sure the lieutenant
hasn't left a message for me?

392
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,973
- A message?
- l'm sure, ma'am.

393
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,934
But perhaps you'd gone
out and no one was home.

394
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,270
What can l say? Maybe he's left.

395
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,231
There was a captain
who came here a lot

396
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,317
and he was suddenly transferred.

397
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,612
ln fact, you wouldn't happen to
know anyone who could help me?

398
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,575
They want to turn my house
into military accommodation.

399
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,786
Don't they have barracks for that?

400
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,080
Ma'am, see if you can help me. lt
would be in your interests, too.

401
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:39,667
l know you can do
anything, Countess.

402
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,252
l know you very well, you see.

403
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,839
One of my sisters spent
years working for...

404
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,176
You're leaving? But what if
the lieutenant should arrive?

405
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,097
Besides, Countess...

406
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,767
what if the lieutenant
has really left?

407
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,477
Who will settle his bill?

408
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,854
l've never said anything, because
l know him well, but...

409
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,817
think of all the
laundry l have to do.

410
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,902
Thank you, ma'am. That's better.

411
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,569
Excuse me, is
Lieutenant Mahler around?

412
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,074
ls he in Venice?

413
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,702
Yes, he's still in Venice..

414
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,081
- Do you know when he'll be back?
- l don't know, ma'am.

415
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,711
- l'll wait for him.
- Please do.

416
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,052
Do sit down.

417
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,267
Do you like our dwelling?

418
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,444
She won't say whether she likes
it, but she comes here anyway.

419
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,742
Two pairs of underpants,,

420
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,953
three shirts,

421
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,040
two smart shirts,

422
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,542
and two sheets.

423
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:50,298
Here you are! The gentleman
will come by tomorrow to pay his bill

424
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,510
But the lieutenant, didn't
he say where he was going?

425
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,928
How should l know?

426
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,473
- He didn't come back last night.
- He stayed out?

427
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,393
- All night?
- Probably not all night.

428
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,771
But he didn't come
back? You didn't see him?

429
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:09,067
How should l know? Perhaps
he was with Kati or with Nena.

430
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,658
Don't lie to me.

431
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:23,498
Well, if you want to
wait for him, please do.

432
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,417
Are you sure he's not nearby?

433
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,046
- Or in the barracks?
- Nothing's certain.

434
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,131
l can assure you of that.

435
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,634
ln fact, it's the one
assurance l can make.

436
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,056
But if you're patient... And since you're
a friend of Franz's, you must be.

437
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,475
Ludwig said he left
Franz an hour ago.

438
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,771
They were playing billiards together.
We don't know where he went after that.

439
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,482
Why can't you keep your mouth shut?

440
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,154
Pay no attention to him. He doesn't
know what he's talking about.

441
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,783
Why don't you sit down?

442
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,536
Franz will be here in a few minutes.

443
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,998
We never know what he's
up to, or where he is.

444
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,544
He's always out
somewhere. He's hard to pin down.

445
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,130
That's just the way he is.

446
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,635
We lived in the same
apartment for three months, once,

447
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,929
in lnnsbruck.

448
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,934
Girls were always coming
around to see him.

449
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,438
And even if he was
home, he refused to see them.

450
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,489
- Countess! We're leaving.
- What is it?

451
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,908
The count has ordered us to pack.

452
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,869
You must have misunderstood him.

453
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,291
What's happening here?

454
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,719
You could have told me about
this. Don't l matter at all?

455
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,680
The Prussians have invaded Holstein.

456
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,766
This means the war has begun.

457
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,353
- l think it would be wiser...
- No, it can't be!

458
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,357
This is so sudden.

459
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,736
- What do you want?
- lnstructions from the countess.

460
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,447
There's no hurry, Laura.

461
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,909
l was dismayed by my
husband's decision.

462
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,038
But l managed to convince him

463
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,875
to delay our departure by
at least twenty-four hours.

464
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,344
Lieutenant Mahler,
please, from the Eighth Company.

465
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,264
The Eighth Company is
no longer here, ma'am.

466
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,891
They're at the
Misericordia barracks.

467
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,982
Oh, Countess! l was
bringing you an umbrella.

468
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,942
The count told me to.

469
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,987
But l didn't know
where to look for you.

470
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,282
l thought l'd start out at
Countess Marcello's, or...

471
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,618
But you're all wet. What
terrible weather!

472
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,496
Even the sky has gone mad.

473
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,789
lt's the war's fault.

474
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,250
l remember as if it
were today that in '59...

475
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,877
The count was worried.

476
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,631
l said you must have had things
to do before the departure.

477
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,468
A man came looking for you.
l had never seen him before.

478
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,887
l didn't tell the count.

479
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,015
He said it was urgent, that
you had to go see him.

480
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,977
You have to go to Campo
San Gerem?a 349

481
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,562
and ring three times.

482
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,900
- When did he come? Who was he?
- l don't know him. You'd just gone out.

483
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,860
He wanted to go looking for you.

484
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,446
l'll be back later.
Give me the umbrella.

485
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,450
What shall l tell the count?

486
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,036
Whatever you want! l don't care!

487
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,581
l really don't
care! Tell him everything!

488
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,626
Tell him!

489
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,939
There was no call
for you to spy on me.

490
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:25,818
l'd have told you
myself. l'm tired of lying.

491
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,695
lt's true, l have a lover.

492
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,240
l love him. l want to be with him!

493
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,912
Livia, At last! We were
waiting for you. Come in.

494
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,457
Livia!

495
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,757
Livia, how wonderful. At last!

496
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,552
Oh, it's you. l didn't
know you were back.

497
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,763
You could have told me.

498
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,897
Livia, we were able to cross
the border last night.

499
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,191
l must get in touch with
our friends in Venice.

500
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,403
- There's no time to lose.
- Why didn't you trust me?

501
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:14,033
- She wanted me to believe that...
- You can't understand.

502
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,535
You can't understand.

503
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,881
l've already been
very clear with Livia.

504
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,760
Now l should tell you
what l said to her.

505
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,347
l have absolutely no
intention of accepting the position

506
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,643
the Austrian government has recently
insisted on offering me.

507
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,269
Livia, how are you?

508
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,398
l was born in Venice,
l was brought up here.

509
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:50,236
My business affairs are tied to
this city. My loved ones are here.

510
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,906
Now, it's clear that whatever
the outcome of this war,

511
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,701
Venice will go to the
ltalian government.

512
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,495
The French Emperor has
vouched for this.

513
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,457
As a result of all
this, l wish to help you.

514
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,419
You can trust me.

515
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,088
As you can see, mine
is a practical offer.

516
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:14,885
lt isn't dictated by enthusiasm or
by ideals and beliefs l don't share.

517
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,887
l understand.

518
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,764
And what do want in return?

519
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,767
l told you, l want to be
able to stay in my country

520
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,813
without being harassed.

521
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,151
- l can't promise you anything.
- l see.

522
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,071
But, one day, you could
testify in my favour.

523
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:37,867
...and a ruby ring.

524
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,498
A gold chain with a watch...

525
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,919
Livia, would you be prepared
to leave for Aldeno tomorrow?

526
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,965
Nothing would please me more. For
days, l've been telling Livia...

527
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,635
l know, it was my fault.
l wanted to wait for you.

528
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,434
l was sure that you would come back.

529
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,188
That's fine, Livia,

530
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,900
but now there's no time to lose.

531
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,694
l'll be leaving Venice tomorrow.

532
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,363
l must reach the
headquarters of the ltalian Army.

533
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,283
They'll instruct me on
the role of the volunteers.

534
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:24,330
We've set up a good communication
network. Luca is already in Aldeno.

535
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,626
l'll be there in four or five
days, if everything goes well.

536
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:34,006
You must take charge of
the money we've raised.

537
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,258
Give it to me,
Andrea. They need it urgently.

538
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,678
Our volunteers are living
off charity, like hermits.

539
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,597
lt's a decent sum.

540
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,141
You must have contributed as well.

541
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,810
No.

542
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:01,575
We've been waiting for
this moment for a long time.

543
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:06,622
And now it has arrived, it feels
like a surprise, doesn't it?

544
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,457
lt comes as a shock.

545
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:16,382
We must all behave as if the lives of
our fighters depend upon our actions.

546
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:21,929
We no longer have any
rights, Livia, only duties.

547
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,973
We must learn to forget ourselves.

548
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,309
l don't care if l sound
bombastic. ltaly is at war.

549
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,228
lt is our war!

550
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,188
Our revolution!

551
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,958
Roberto's words,

552
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,793
his trust in me,

553
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,297
had given me the courage to leave.

554
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,429
The first days spent in the
peaceful surroundings of our villa at Aldeno

555
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,683
reminded me of the
periods of convalescence

556
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,103
that follow a serious
childhood illness.

557
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,967
- Laura! Laura!
- Yes, l'm coming. Just a minute.

558
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,553
When the dogs started barking, l
noticed someone on the balcony.

559
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,971
l noticed someone on the balcony.

560
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:50,226
- l didn't hear a thing.
- Now be quiet. The countess is asleep.

561
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,026
- Who is it?
- lt's me. Laura.

562
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:06,158
- What is it?
- Countess, you must forgive me.

563
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,244
But the gatekeeper...

564
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,623
Yes?

565
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,876
...has seen someone on the balcony.

566
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,974
Countess!

567
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,439
He's sure he saw
someone on the balcony.

568
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,108
Yes, it was me.

569
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:43,070
- Have you lost your mind?
- Yes, in Venice, when you left.

570
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,906
- ls the door locked?
- The door...

571
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,453
- Laura?
- Yes, Countess.

572
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,955
lt was me.

573
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,834
- Go to bed.
- You see, you fool?

574
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,467
- Did they see me?
- What were you thinking?

575
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,303
How could you?

576
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:17,062
Why do you keep all those dogs? To keep
away your enemies or your lovers?

577
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,316
Why did you decide
to come here, Franz?

578
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,860
l didn't decide
anything. l just came.

579
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:29,533
l suddenly felt l had to
see you again, so l came.

580
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,329
Livia!

581
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,044
So you'd have me get torn
to pieces by your dogs?

582
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,966
No! No! No!

583
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:50,721
Go and hide over there.

584
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,183
Go, over there.

585
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:19,875
l... l don't believe you risked
your life just to see me again.

586
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,462
There was a time when l
would have believed you,

587
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,217
before you began to
miss our rendezvous,

588
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,680
before those agonising days

589
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,017
when l couldn't find you anywhere.

590
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,022
l am younger than
you, Countess Serpieri,

591
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:46,151
and not as smart as
l'd like to think.

592
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,281
When l began to realise that
l'd fallen in love with a woman

593
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:55,119
who would never be able to love me,

594
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,079
my first reaction was to disappear.

595
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,873
That's why you didn't see me again.

596
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,876
But it made no difference.

597
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,422
When l realised that you were
the one slipping away from me,

598
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,882
that you'd left Venice,

599
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,760
all l could think of
was to find you again.

600
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:18,183
You must have some other
reason l don't understand.

601
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:22,479
For what other reason would a
man risk his life to come here?

602
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,692
But can't you see? We're at war now!

603
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,777
War...

604
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,656
l'm so tired.

605
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,200
All l want is to look
at you, to be with you.

606
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:39,496
That's why l came, that's
all l can think about.

607
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,380
l would have believed you, once.

608
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,717
lf you don't believe
me, l'd better go now.

609
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,302
No, wait!

610
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,846
Wait.

611
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,363
Franz?

612
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,324
Come here, Franz.

613
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,665
Franz.

614
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,542
- Stay here.
- Here?

615
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,003
- All right.
- Please.

616
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,423
Don't make any noise.

617
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,966
Wait.

618
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:03,121
Countess, what's going on?

619
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,123
Be quiet, you fool.

620
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,047
Ah! Countess. What a scare! l
knew something would happen.

621
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,676
l was fretful all
night. l couldn't sleep.

622
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,679
- Was it really you on that balcony?
- Simone!

623
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:23,600
Look everywhere! See if
you can find any footprints!

624
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:30,691
Make sure no one is
hidden in the garden!

625
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,820
That's good, Simone! Keep
looking around with the dogs.

626
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,283
Do you need me, Countess?

627
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:46,331
No. l don't need
anything. Go on, go to sleep.

628
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,083
Keep looking.

629
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,336
He must have fled when
he heard the dogs barking.

630
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,673
- l'm going back to bed.
- Good night, Count.

631
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,599
Giuseppe, look behind the
stairs! Be sure to have a good look!

632
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,979
l'm sorry. You must forgive me.

633
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,906
We're no longer in Venice.

634
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,618
l've changed.

635
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:27,205
l can think straight
again. My mind is clear.

636
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,258
- Livia, listen to me...
- No! We're no longer in Venice.

637
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:45,974
You made me lose my sense
of shame, my dignity.

638
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,894
- But why?
- lt's true, l lost all my dignity,

639
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,523
for a wretched, illicit love,

640
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,362
a shameful love.

641
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,701
Livia, my love.

642
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,875
We're no longer in Venice.

643
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,297
Fine, we're no longer in Venice.

644
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,466
We're agreed on that.

645
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,060
- We're agreed on that.
- May l sit down?

646
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:35,857
Yes, seeing as you can't leave
until they've tied up the dogs.

647
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,486
Thank you.

648
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,415
l'm so sleepy.

649
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,501
l haven't slept for three nights.

650
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,971
l love the smell of summer.

651
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:10,475
l love the smell of ripe wheat.

652
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,312
This place is full of that scent.

653
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,275
l'm so tired.

654
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,611
There's a gentle
laziness in the air.

655
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,744
What did you say?

656
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,207
The dogs have gone away.

657
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,256
You speak so quietly,

658
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,550
that l can't hear
what you're saying.

659
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,595
Did l mishear you?

660
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,015
l thought that you were saying...

661
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,267
that you were saying...

662
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,436
Franz...

663
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,439
Dear Franz...

664
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,358
l'm so alone...

665
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,486
please...

666
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,030
stay with me.

667
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,412
You misheard.

668
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:15,874
Forgive me.

669
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,628
l misheard.

670
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,425
l said you had to leave now.

671
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,930
You must leave. You must leave.

672
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,140
What did you say?

673
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,644
l said that the danger was past.

674
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,939
You can go now.

675
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,399
How long...

676
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:46,154
How long has it been since we
last saw each other, my love?

677
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,157
That's what l was
dreaming you would say.

678
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,118
l told you to leave.

679
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,373
Leave. Leave. Leave...

680
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,584
ls that it?

681
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,088
ls that what you really want?

682
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,634
l was hoping you'd ask me to stay.

683
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,523
Oh, Franz...

684
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,571
Franz...

685
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,990
Yes, Franz.

686
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,996
Please stay.

687
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,865
Franz...

688
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:17,954
Franz, wake up, my love.

689
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,630
lt is almost dawn,

690
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:30,550
and you told me you had to
be in Verona before nightfall.

691
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,640
Who is it?

692
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,309
It's me, Livia.

693
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,648
Franz, wake up. lt's daylight.

694
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,402
- What did you say?
- You must go away now.

695
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,947
The sun will be high soon.

696
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,407
And if they see you...

697
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,953
Close your eyes.

698
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,667
- l didn't close them all night.
- Why?

699
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,462
l was watching you sleep.

700
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,803
That's why l slept so well.

701
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,848
l dreamt l was home.

702
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,687
l was a child, and l played at
being a soldier with a wooden sword.

703
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,796
- l must go.
- l wish you could stay!

704
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,925
- l wish l could...
- What do you wish you could do?

705
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:59,431
l wish l could stay in your
arms, just as l did tonight,

706
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,058
for the rest of my life.

707
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:08,690
Farewell, l must go.

708
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,026
- l must go. l must go.
- No!

709
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,611
The sun's coming up.
lt's already late.

710
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,991
You wouldn't want them to see
me climbing down your window?

711
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,368
No, no!

712
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,953
Don't go yet.

713
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:25,623
l'll hide you.

714
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,961
l'll have you with
me for another day.

715
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,007
With me. Wait. Wait!

716
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,384
Let's hurry!

717
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,230
Come along, hurry.

718
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,433
Livia!

719
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,353
Come, stay with me a while.

720
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,481
No, the maid must
find me in my room.

721
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:35,151
- But it's still early. There's time.
- Don't speak so loud.

722
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,702
l won't say another word.

723
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,997
You know, it's not bad here.

724
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:53,294
l could stay here my whole life.

725
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,588
Then why don't you stay?

726
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,592
Have you forgotten that l must
go to war and become a hero?

727
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,678
Oh, no. No.

728
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,930
Try to forget that.

729
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:07,308
lf only one could forget.

730
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,768
lf only.

731
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,399
One of my friends did
an incredible thing.

732
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:15,692
Which one?

733
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:21,239
A companion. An officer.

734
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,908
What did he do?

735
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,911
He managed to bribe a doctor,

736
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:30,206
and got himself declared unfit
for military service.

737
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,002
He went for a check-up, you see?

738
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,797
The doctor pretended to
find him a heart defect,

739
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:41,467
which required a quiet,
restful existence.

740
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:46,347
So they sent him home, free
from any further obligations.

741
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,810
- But how can this be?
- l told you. He bribed a doctor!

742
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,521
A huge sum.

743
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,026
l didn't think such
things could happen.

744
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:03,948
But, after all, those of our
generation were spoiled like children.

745
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:07,994
We like elegant
uniforms because they suit us.

746
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:11,706
The gold braid, the tabs,

747
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,709
the sound of the marching band that
accompanies our heroic parade.

748
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,005
But then here's the
other side of the coin -

749
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,174
being far from our women,

750
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:26,054
being hungry, cold, tired.

751
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:32,185
When it comes to raising a glass to
future victories, we're all there.

752
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:37,690
But we're not willing to pay the
price of the victory we're toasting.

753
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:41,444
- The loss of an arm, an amputated leg.
- That's enough!

754
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:45,198
A face so disfigured that it
causes others to recoil in horror.

755
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,783
No, Franz! No!

756
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,540
And why? War.

757
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:58,753
Tens of thousands of men
ready to kill each other,

758
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,172
for no reason, no purpose.

759
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,300
Reason has nothing to do with war.

760
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:08,513
What is war, after all, if
not the most convenient means

761
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:13,559
to force men to think and act in the
way that most suits their leaders?

762
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:17,230
Why are you silent, dear?

763
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,565
What are you thinking about?

764
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,402
That war is horrible. Horrible.

765
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,286
l'll be back as soon as l can.

766
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:53,933
So many troops went past last night.

767
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:57,520
Even the heavy artillery. The
whole house was shaking.

768
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,064
They're going from
lnnsbruck to Verona.

769
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,233
- Ah, they're going to Verona...
- Count!

770
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,361
Count, should l
report last night's incident?

771
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:06,696
No, better not.

772
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:11,326
l bet someone found out about the
wheat and is trying to get us into trouble.

773
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,745
None of the men can have spoken.

774
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,873
Still, let's have some
men keep watch at night.

775
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:22,628
But...look over
there! lsn't that Le Ronghe?

776
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:27,467
- Yes, it is! That fire is at Le Ronghe!
- That's one hell of a blaze!

777
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,135
Let's go and see!

778
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:33,556
Look, Count, look at that
dense, dark cloud over there!

779
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,059
lt looks like a
barn is burning down!

780
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:39,520
We must send someone
over there right away!

781
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:43,816
To Le Ronghe! To Le
Ronghe! Look, sir.

782
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,276
lt's coming from Mangini's house!

783
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,780
lt can't be! His house
is behind the hill!

784
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,742
lt's further away! lt must
be the stables at Piovene.

785
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:00,541
Come on! Let's go to
the granary to look.

786
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,668
lt's just some slag piles, l expect.

787
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:05,463
Can't you see all
the smoke, Countess?

788
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,215
That's Mancini's house!

789
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,176
No, it's very clear from here.

790
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,345
Perhaps it's a military camp.

791
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:15,890
lt's best to be sure.
You two, come with me.

792
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:27,068
This is not good... Let's
look out the windows!

793
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:31,572
Let's hope no wind will
rise All that wheat...

794
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,950
Listen, the bells!

795
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:38,329
What are they waiting for? For
the whole country to burn?

796
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:43,918
Sir, we can't see a thing
here. Let's go to the other side.

797
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,296
What's happening here? The door is
locked with a key. Let's move it!

798
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:52,176
Look! The view is
much better from here.

799
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:55,346
Romagnano's patriots.

800
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,599
They will challenge the Austrians.

801
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,853
Have they lined up
close to the houses?

802
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,313
These idiots are endangering us all!

803
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:11,070
And that's why they are
setting fire to our farms?

804
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:14,115
Antonio! Call Giuseppe!

805
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,076
Antonio!

806
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:22,039
Tell him to prepare
the carriage! Hurry!

807
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:39,223
- Countess?
- What happened?

808
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:42,226
That gentleman is there.

809
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:47,982
- And Luca has returned from Romagnano.
- Countess!

810
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,821
Good news.

811
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:58,451
Marchese Ussoni has
arrived at our headquarters.

812
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,037
It's will just be a few hours now...

813
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,917
We are waiting for further
orders. Garibaldi is in Salo!

814
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:11,339
Two of our representatives met with a
spokesman of the General in Trento yesterday.

815
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,883
Garibaldi congratulated
the patriots.

816
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,636
He didn't think there
were so many of us.

817
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:22,558
His troups arrived and they
saw the work had been done already!

818
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,313
We don't need help to
protect our country!

819
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:31,025
Sure. Tell me more.

820
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,489
- Come back later. This evening!
- Countess!

821
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:43,329
Ussoni told me, you have to

822
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,581
give me the money
collected in Venice.

823
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,292
There should be more
than 3000 florins!

824
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:53,214
I don't know. I haven't counted it.

825
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,758
I'm sure you're right.

826
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,431
This evening! Come
back this evening, OK?

827
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:06,852
- That can't grow to such
proportions in such short time!

828
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,771
They haven't told me anything.

829
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,900
Nothing! They must
take me for an idiot...

830
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,695
- Count, the carriage is ready.
- Good.

831
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:18,447
- I'm going there.
- Yes, and hurry!

832
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,743
- Good day, Count
- Good day..

833
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,247
Antonio, my hat! Quick!

834
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,834
- Take Luca outside.
- Good day, Countess.

835
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,796
- Until tonight.
- Very well, Countess.

836
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,225
How did you get here? How?

837
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:50,062
Laura! lsn't that
her name? The maid.

838
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:54,358
l thought it was you who'd sent her.

839
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,569
How extraordinary! She
came to collect me,

840
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,405
brought me here and
gave me breakfast.

841
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,365
My God!

842
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,243
- She knows you're here!
- What harm can it do?

843
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,787
This is what ladies' maids are for!

844
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,588
Countess! The count
is looking for you.

845
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,065
We're leaving. l won't
be back for lunch.

846
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:35,358
Very well.

847
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,903
- What?
- l said, very well!

848
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:41,197
At your service, Countess.

849
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,823
Goodbye.

850
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,483
What are you thinking?

851
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,737
l was thinking...of something.

852
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,535
Tell me what.

853
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,627
This morning, in the granary...

854
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,756
you told me of that
friend of yours...

855
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,843
who they sent home...

856
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,221
because a doctor had
said he had a bad heart.

857
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,014
So?

858
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,648
Couldn't you do the same?

859
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,153
Me?

860
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:04,780
Yes, Franz, you.

861
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:07,450
You want me to play the cripple,

862
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:11,746
bribing some crook to
pass me off as unfit?

863
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,040
Yes.

864
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,171
You think me...

865
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:23,966
capable... of something
so contemptible?

866
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,895
And even if l was...

867
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,566
it comes at a price.

868
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,656
How much?

869
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,922
2000 florins.

870
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:09,595
2000 florins! Impossible.

871
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,099
- More than l'm worth, is it?
- lf you could...

872
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,101
lf you found a way...

873
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:18,437
You could stay close to me...

874
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:21,982
- At Trento, couldn't you?
- No... No.

875
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,902
Regulations state that
the discharged soldier

876
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,530
must remain close to his regiment.

877
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:35,454
- lf only you could!
- l have to leave, lt's late.

878
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,958
lf l'm not in Verona by tomorrow
morning l'll be declared a deserter.

879
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,085
- No!
- l could be shot.

880
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,921
That would solve all our problems.

881
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:47,132
- We have no time!
- Wait! Wait, Franz!

882
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,095
Wait.

883
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,215
Close the door!

884
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,842
Quickly! Come here!

885
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,643
My love! ls it yours?

886
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:42,229
Your husband's? Whose then?

887
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:46,150
l can't tell you! You'll
think l'm insane!

888
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:49,111
l am! l am insane!

889
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:54,575
Oh, my love! My love!

890
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:58,704
My darling...

891
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:04,752
My poor, sweet love!

892
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,171
My poor, poor darling.

893
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,174
- Who is it?
- lt's me. Countess. May l come in?

894
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,675
Don't come in!

895
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,721
- Don't come in!
- lt's me, Countess...

896
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:18,140
l said no!

897
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:22,978
Have you counted it? ls it enough?

898
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:25,773
l know you have
given me your heart...

899
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,566
and not only your heart.

900
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:34,114
l don't feel guilty
accepting the money.

901
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,533
l'd feel guilty not accepting it.

902
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,202
Do you believe me?

903
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:40,204
Countess! Countess!

904
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:46,335
- The count will be back any minute
- Yes, l realise!

905
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,879
Tonio saw him down in the
village and he told him...

906
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:53,926
l told Tonio to wait in the kitchen. l
had the gardener called too, with an excuse.

907
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,053
You need to avoid the terrace...

908
01:22:56,221 --> 01:23:00,057
Ada's putting the washing out. l tried
to call her into the house, but...

909
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,811
Luca's here, too.

910
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,938
l showed him into the sitting room.

911
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,273
- He's waiting.
- Very well!

912
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,512
Write to me as soon
as you can, l beg you.

913
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,725
l have written the address here.

914
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:46,770
Give the letter to a civilian
and have them take it to Luca,

915
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,106
and l shall receive it directly.

916
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,692
- l must hear from you!
- l'll write.

917
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,819
Don't forget. As soon as possible

918
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,282
Go now!

919
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,704
Send word when all is settled,
and l will come to you at once.

920
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:07,416
l cannot live like this.

921
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:10,836
You shouldn't love me.

922
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:15,632
No one should.

923
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,689
l was irrevocably tied to him.

924
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,818
For him, l had forgotten...

925
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:38,489
and betrayed all of
those who were fighting,

926
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:40,699
in an attempt to realise

927
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:44,119
my long unfulfilled dreams.

928
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:16,527
Marchese Ussoni.

929
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:20,405
You should take a
route around our left wing,

930
01:25:20,573 --> 01:25:22,199
just outside of Valeggio...

931
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:26,036
But there will be serious
obstacles. lt will not be easy.

932
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:31,792
- Thank you!
- Good luck, Marchese Ussoni!

933
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:13,584
Stop!

934
01:26:13,751 --> 01:26:17,004
Can you take me to
Oliosi near Montevento?

935
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:21,091
- lt's dangerous...
- Don't worry, we can find a different route.

936
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,678
Here. There we go!

937
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:54,351
Which way should l
go to get to Oliosi?

938
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,980
Oliosi... The roads to
Montevento are blocked.

939
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,690
There are battles going on.

940
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:02,651
Try to reach that hill, turn left,

941
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,988
you'll come to a large,
square farmstead called Ca' Pasquale.

942
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:07,322
- Here.
- That's it.

943
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,658
From there, continue
going left, maybe...

944
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:12,202
Take the road to
Maragnote and on to Menso.

945
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,788
We can still get to
Sant'Ambrogio avoiding Oliosi.

946
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,873
Thank you, Lieutenant.

947
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:18,917
- Are you from the south?
- Naples.

948
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,544
Good luck, Lieutenant!

949
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,464
- l'll take the reins.
- She goes slowly, mind.

950
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:25,525
l have to get over the
hill. lt's absolutely imperative!

951
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:30,364
l have safe conduct signed
by General La Marmora in person.

952
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:32,699
To arms!

953
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:10,797
l had received a letter from Franz.

954
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:14,176
He had been
discharged, and was in Verona.

955
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:17,304
But he urged me to stay where l was.

956
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,765
The journey was dangerous and
he feared for my safety.

957
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,895
Battle had
commenced on all fronts...

958
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,190
and the news that reached Aldeno

959
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:31,401
confirmed hopes of
an ltalian victory.

960
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,571
You can see the canons
firing from Sant'Ambrogio!

961
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,782
- He said the Austrians are leaving Verona!
- No, they left yesterday!

962
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:41,495
Luca's here!

963
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,874
Let's hear what he has to say!

964
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,793
Here he is.

965
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,472
What did he say?

966
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,183
The Austrians have fled Verona!

967
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,189
We'll get the lot of them!

968
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:11,316
Viva ltalia!

969
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,071
Good day, Countess.

970
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,073
Are the Austrians leaving Verona?

971
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:21,284
Yes, Countess. We're
advancing all along the front..

972
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:23,537
They've called for reinforcements
at Trento,

973
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:25,205
and they're leaving Verona!

974
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,542
And this time they'll
be gone for good!

975
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,044
Viva Italia!

976
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:32,963
And we have no part to play?

977
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,841
The time has come to act for us
as well...and Marchese Ussoni.

978
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:41,638
We've heard nothing of Marchese
Ussoni. No news...nothing.

979
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,768
We can do nothing.

980
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:49,479
We must await orders.

981
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:52,440
But Countess, we
can't wait any longer.

982
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,359
Even having heard nothing,

983
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,112
our troops must move
in and occupy the area.

984
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,406
There's no more time to lose!

985
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:01,866
We will not participate.

986
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:05,078
Garibaldi will be coming here!

987
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:08,707
Countess, just think,
Garibaldi! Bloody hell!

988
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,773
What's going on? What are you doing?

989
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:39,237
Officer, what's
happening? Where are you all going?

990
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,698
We've been ordered to retreat.

991
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,559
Come on! You can do it!

992
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,283
Who are you? Are you injured??

993
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:54,539
Everyone is retreating,
Lieutenant. Yes it's true. lt's a disaster.

994
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:57,292
Not us. Eh, lads?

995
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,837
Everyone here's
staying put, Lieutenant!

996
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:05,216
Lieutenant! Orders to retreat!

997
01:36:05,384 --> 01:36:08,011
- Everyone out!
- Understood, Lieutenant!

998
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:12,015
Always last to know,
eh? Come on, lads!

999
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:14,809
Come on, lads!

1000
01:36:17,688 --> 01:36:20,273
l decided to leave. At dawn.

1001
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:24,903
Before patriots could take
over the surrounding area,

1002
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,781
and before the ltalian
troops could reach Verona.

1003
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:33,828
l knew l would never
return to my house, my people.

1004
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:38,333
And yet, l felt neither
regret nor emotion.

1005
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:54,349
The walls of the
carriage were burning,

1006
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,561
and the sultry air suffocated me.

1007
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:03,358
l had Franz's letter with me.

1008
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:07,612
And l re-read it over and over
again, even though l knew it by heart.

1009
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:10,949
''My darling Livia...

1010
01:37:11,784 --> 01:37:13,535
''You have saved my life.

1011
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:17,664
''The money was
sufficient, for now at least

1012
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,583
''to satisfy the rapacious doctors.

1013
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:24,212
''l have been discharged and
they are keeping me in Verona.

1014
01:37:25,464 --> 01:37:28,216
''l have a beautiful room overlooking
the river Adige,

1015
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:31,094
''on Via Santo Stefano, number 149.

1016
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:35,598
''l miss you day and night.

1017
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:40,228
''But don't come just
yet. Stay where you are.

1018
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:42,814
''The journey would
be too dangerous.

1019
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:46,442
''Love me always...

1020
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,278
''as l love you.''

1021
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:54,576
- .From there take the road to Ala.
- Drive on! Make way!

1022
01:40:01,912 --> 01:40:05,456
Do you have safe conduct to
enter Verona at this hour?

1023
01:40:05,624 --> 01:40:08,251
No, but l am Countess Serpieri.

1024
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,378
My husband is an Austrian officer.

1025
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:12,714
l am here to meet relatives in town.

1026
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:15,008
Very good, Countess. You may pass.

1027
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,218
But l must warn you,
tonight the streets of Verona

1028
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:19,721
won't be safe for a lady.

1029
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:21,097
Thank you.

1030
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:24,851
- Quickly! Via Santo Stefano 149.
- Yes, Countess.

1031
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:21,032
Well, what a lovely surprise.

1032
01:41:21,408 --> 01:41:22,909
Oh, Franz!

1033
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,368
What?

1034
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,163
l am here.

1035
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:31,334
Has something happened?

1036
01:41:31,835 --> 01:41:33,419
l am here, Franz.

1037
01:41:34,004 --> 01:41:36,798
l told you in my letter not to come.

1038
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,427
- Did you not receive it?
- Yes, but l came all the same.

1039
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:44,597
- l couldn't bear the anxiety any longer.
- What anxiety?

1040
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:49,102
- Anxiety over what?
- What might happen to you.

1041
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:51,813
You knew l was safe.

1042
01:41:52,356 --> 01:41:54,482
You knew how...

1043
01:41:55,567 --> 01:41:57,110
with your money.

1044
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:01,405
You know it bought me safe passage,

1045
01:42:01,573 --> 01:42:04,659
calm, wellbeing,

1046
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:07,245
peace and amusement.

1047
01:42:07,746 --> 01:42:10,581
But l wanted to be sure...

1048
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:16,629
to see it with my own eyes.

1049
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:20,883
Fine! Now you have.

1050
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:23,970
You shouldn't have come.

1051
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:28,349
lt was a bad decision,
and now you'll be sorry.

1052
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:31,936
You see?

1053
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,939
l am no longer an officer,

1054
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:36,941
or a gentleman.

1055
01:42:40,571 --> 01:42:43,114
l'm a drunken deserter..

1056
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:52,707
who reeks to high heaven

1057
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:55,918
of cowardice and vice.

1058
01:42:57,754 --> 01:42:59,714
But now l'm here, Franz.

1059
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,675
l will stay with you always..

1060
01:43:04,219 --> 01:43:06,179
l have left everything for you.

1061
01:43:09,474 --> 01:43:11,934
Take me in your arms, Franz.

1062
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:21,694
l haven't washed or
shaved in a few days.

1063
01:43:24,156 --> 01:43:28,451
l wouldn't want to disgust
you by coming too close!

1064
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:33,915
You'd get dirty.

1065
01:43:39,254 --> 01:43:40,796
Franz!

1066
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:55,394
- You're not alone?.
- Don't worry about her.

1067
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:59,899
She comes for a couple of
hours each night to keep me company.

1068
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:05,655
Do you want to meet her?

1069
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:09,325
Don't be shy.

1070
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:13,120
After all, she belongs to you.

1071
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:16,582
l pay for her with your money.

1072
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,974
Clara! Come here.

1073
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:37,770
l'd like you to meet a great lady.

1074
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:44,902
The Countess Livia Serpieri.

1075
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,906
She has made a long journey.

1076
01:44:49,074 --> 01:44:52,326
As you see, she is exhausted.

1077
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:58,124
She's travelled amid the
soldiers returning from battle.

1078
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:02,962
Men who haven't been lucky enough

1079
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:06,048
to have what l have...

1080
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,848
a rich benefactor.

1081
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:23,482
Clara,

1082
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:25,609
Get her something to drink.

1083
01:45:46,548 --> 01:45:48,424
Wash it first!

1084
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:50,217
Stupid girl.

1085
01:45:51,553 --> 01:45:53,596
lt's for a lady.

1086
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:57,350
Ladies don't drink from
unwashed glasses.

1087
01:45:57,517 --> 01:45:58,976
Didn't you know?

1088
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:11,155
Guests must be treated with respect.

1089
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:17,411
You don't want it?

1090
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:20,122
Are you unwell?

1091
01:46:25,587 --> 01:46:27,797
What are you waiting
for? Help her you fool!

1092
01:46:28,423 --> 01:46:31,175
Lift her veil! Take
off her hat, her gloves!

1093
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:35,513
Countess Serpieri is a lady! A
high-class lady, and important lady!

1094
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,014
Can't you see?

1095
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,520
An Italian aristocrat.

1096
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:45,606
- Haven't l told you about her?
- No!

1097
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:49,360
You don't remember?

1098
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,656
You didn't listen because you
thought l was just crowing.

1099
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:57,284
You didn't believe me when
l said that a real lady

1100
01:46:57,452 --> 01:47:02,081
like the Countess Serpieri

1101
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,916
was in love with me.

1102
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:09,255
lt's true!

1103
01:47:11,299 --> 01:47:12,341
She said to me,

1104
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,010
that she didn't know what love was

1105
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:17,388
before she met me.

1106
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,771
Why are you saying these things?

1107
01:47:28,066 --> 01:47:31,861
To hurt me or to hurt yourself?

1108
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:34,780
l beg your pardon, but
l didn't hear you,

1109
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:37,533
you're speaking so quietly.

1110
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:41,787
Did you hear what she said, Clara?

1111
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:45,875
No, l didn't hear
anything, and l don't want to either.

1112
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:49,753
- l'm going.
- You're insane!

1113
01:47:51,047 --> 01:47:52,840
Livia,

1114
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:56,302
you must forbid her to
leave at this hour.

1115
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:02,183
lnvite her to sit
down to table with us.

1116
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:07,438
Ask her.

1117
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:16,113
Please, stay.

1118
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,423
Don't mind him. He's drunk.

1119
01:49:06,414 --> 01:49:08,791
Who exactly do you think you are?

1120
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:13,170
Do you have such a
high opinion of yourself

1121
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:16,173
that you can't sit at
the same table as a whore?

1122
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,638
What difference is
there between the two of you?

1123
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:28,269
l'll tell you myself.

1124
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:32,898
She is young, and beautiful,

1125
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:35,693
and men have to pay for her.

1126
01:49:37,779 --> 01:49:39,446
You, on the other hand...

1127
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:49,540
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

1128
01:49:51,376 --> 01:49:53,961
l don't like being looked
at like that, understand?

1129
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:57,715
Do you think l've gone mad?

1130
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,509
No! l'm not mad!

1131
01:50:01,052 --> 01:50:03,596
l've never been as
lucid in my entire life.

1132
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:09,018
Listen, and try to understand.

1133
01:50:09,185 --> 01:50:13,480
Try to see me as l really am.

1134
01:50:13,648 --> 01:50:15,941
Not as you imagine me to be!

1135
01:50:17,652 --> 01:50:20,863
The image you have created
of me is mere fantasy.!

1136
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:22,656
lt's all in your head!

1137
01:50:22,824 --> 01:50:25,784
lt has nothing to do
with who l really am.

1138
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:27,453
So, who am l?

1139
01:50:28,246 --> 01:50:31,415
How do l live? By what means?

1140
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:34,501
With money l procure in two ways.

1141
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:37,129
Money l get from women,

1142
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,715
and money l steal,
cheating at cards.

1143
01:50:41,092 --> 01:50:43,302
l am a master of both arts.

1144
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:46,305
That's how l make my living.

1145
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:52,561
l have other charms, too.

1146
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,690
l am a deserter because
l'm a coward.

1147
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:02,321
And l don't mind being either!

1148
01:51:06,868 --> 01:51:08,744
What matters to me is that my
compatriots won a battle today

1149
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:12,790
in a place called Custoza,

1150
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:15,167
when l know that they are
going to lose the war.

1151
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:17,294
And not just the war.

1152
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:19,713
And that Austria, in a few years,

1153
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:21,548
will be finished,

1154
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:26,011
and a whole world will disappear,

1155
01:51:26,638 --> 01:51:30,349
the world to which we both belong.

1156
01:51:32,894 --> 01:51:37,022
The new world your cousin speaks
of holds no interest for me.

1157
01:51:38,066 --> 01:51:41,276
l think it's much
better not to be involved,

1158
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,072
and to take your
pleasure however you can.

1159
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:49,952
And, for that matter, so do you.

1160
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:52,371
Otherwise you wouldn't
have given me money

1161
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:54,873
to buy yourself an
hour's worth of love.

1162
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,673
- No!
- That's enough!

1163
01:52:02,841 --> 01:52:05,050
lt's too late. lt's over.

1164
01:52:05,635 --> 01:52:08,137
l'm not your knight
in shining armour!

1165
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:12,850
And l don't love you anymore.

1166
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:16,270
l wanted money, l
got it. That's all.

1167
01:52:22,277 --> 01:52:25,320
Oh! And l forgot. l'm
also an informant.

1168
01:52:25,488 --> 01:52:28,365
lt was me who betrayed your
cousin to the police.

1169
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,577
Of course, you knew
this, but pretended not to

1170
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,121
to save our love affair!

1171
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,917
No!

1172
01:52:48,970 --> 01:52:52,681
Go on! Go on, my lady!

1173
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:57,227
Run! Run away, you whore!

1174
01:52:57,437 --> 01:52:58,270
Run! Run away!

1175
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:01,899
Break your neck! Don't look back!

1176
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:22,479
..with devastating precision.

1177
01:54:23,898 --> 01:54:28,777
Afternoon report
of the Fifth Corps -

1178
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:35,409
After heavy fighting,
Santa Lucia was taken.

1179
01:54:36,619 --> 01:54:39,621
At 7 pm, Custoza was won.

1180
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:45,502
The enemy has certainly put
up an admirable fight.

1181
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:50,757
The first of the
offensives were particularly forceful.

1182
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:55,721
Officers set their
men a fine example.

1183
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:06,148
l've come to fulfil my duty

1184
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:08,609
as a loyal subject.

1185
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:11,320
The countess is Austrian?

1186
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,033
Venetian.

1187
01:55:33,968 --> 01:55:35,260
Here.

1188
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:44,478
l don't understand. ls
it addressed to you?

1189
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:14,049
Right then, l don't have
much time, let's see to this.

1190
01:56:24,602 --> 01:56:26,311
The letter is from...

1191
01:56:28,189 --> 01:56:31,358
Franz Mahler, of the
Third Artillery Regiment.

1192
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:33,026
And, so?

1193
01:56:34,946 --> 01:56:36,571
lt's quite clear.

1194
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:42,035
He bribed doctors into

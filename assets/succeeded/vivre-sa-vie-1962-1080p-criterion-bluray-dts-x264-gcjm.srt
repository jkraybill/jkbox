A CAFE — NANA WANTS TO GIVE UP —
PAUL — THE PINBALL MACHINE

8
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,683
Do you really like the guy?

9
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,024
I don’t know.

10
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,526
I wonder
what I was even thinking.

11
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,612
Does he have more money
than me?

12
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,697
What do you care?

13
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,737
What do you care?

14
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,958
Something bothering you?

15
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,126
No, I just wanted to deliver
that line a specific way.

16
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,928
I didn’t know
the best way to say it.

17
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,141
Or I did know,
but I don’t anymore.

18
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,979
Just when I should know, too.
Doesn’t that ever happen to you?

19
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,396
Don’t you ever talk
about anything but yourself?

20
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,731
You’re horrible.

21
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,857
I’m not horrible, Nana.
I’m sad.

22
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,244
I’m not sad, Paul.
l’m horrible.

23
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,741
Don’t talk nonsense.
This isn’t a stage.

24
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:18,255
You never do as | ask, but you
always want me to do what you want.

25
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,758
Anyway, I’m fed up.
I want to die.

26
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,510
- Is that so?
- Yes, that’s so.

27
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,672
More nonsense.

28
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,186
lt’s exhausting loving you.
I always have to beg.

29
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,929
I exist too.

30
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,100
You say I’m cruel,
but you’re the cruel one.

31
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,998
Why do you say that? It isn’t true.
You mean Sunday evening?

32
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,541
You know very well when.

33
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,503
I begged you
to introduce me to that man.

34
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,964
You did it on purpose.

35
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,670
Yes, I did.

36
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,005
You’re pathetic.

37
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,306
If we started over,
I’d just cheat on you again.

38
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,138
Don’t say that.

39
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,727
Don’t say that.

40
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,142
It’s true.

41
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,817
I thought it was important
we should meet, but I don’t anymore.

42
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,651
We might have
got together again.

43
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,912
But the more we talk,
the less the words mean.

44
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,326
Anyway, if I make it on the stage,
it won’t be thanks to you.

45
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,878
Acting isn’t everything.

46
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,255
Not you too!
Why do you say that?

47
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,167
If it’s what I want,
why should you mind?

48
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,007
I might be discovered
someday.

49
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,398
Yes, you mustn’t give up.

50
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,018
I haven’t given up music.

51
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,988
Not like your English lessons.
You were never really interested.

52
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,028
I’m not giving up.

53
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,867
In fact, that guy’s going
to take pictures of me.

54
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,072
Maybe I’ll get into the movies.

55
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,498
That’ll be the day.

56
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,202
You’re horrible, Paul.

57
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,716
You’re horrible, Paul.

58
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,308
You really are.
It’s always the same.

59
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:40,689
You say you love me,
but you don’t consider me special.

60
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:46,903
I hardly love you anymore,
but I still consider you special.

61
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,525
Why do you say things like that?
I think we’re all the same.

62
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,245
You don’t approve of me
looking for work?

63
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,949
lt suits you even less
than all the rest.

64
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,415
Anyway, you’re leaving me
because I’m poor.

65
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,046
When all’s said and done, maybe.

66
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,213
Have you got the pictures
you mentioned on the phone?

67
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,803
I forgot them. They’ll be ready
at the end of the week.

68
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,976
Is he all right?
Is he eating well?

69
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,514
He had an earache,
but the doctor said it was nothing.

70
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,149
What’s your job at Pathé-Marconi?

71
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,276
I sell records.

72
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,231
Can you lend me 2,000 francs?

73
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,946
Out of the question.

74
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,160
Your parents
must be glad I’m gone.

75
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,915
No, they liked you.

76
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,667
I’ll bet.

77
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,378
What’s that look for?

78
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,219
What’s that look for?

79
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,055
Nothing.

80
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,677
Let’s not start quarreling again.

81
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,812
How about a game?

82
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,473
Sure.

83
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,191
Got a coin?
I only have one.

84
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,981
Yes, I do.

85
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,087
You go first.

86
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,946
l’m suddenly thinking of those essays
my dad’s students write.

87
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,534
What about them?

88
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,702
He read us some great ones
last night over dinner.

89
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,336
They’re just kids. They had
to describe their favorite animals.

90
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,839
One little girl of eight
chose a bird.

91
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,712
How did it go?

92
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,008
“A bird is an animal
with an inside and an outside.

93
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,518
Take away the outside
and the inside is left.

94
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,272
Take away the inside
and you see its soul.”

95

THE RECORD SHOP — 2,000 FRANCS —
NANA LIVES HER LIFE

96
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,593
No, we’re out of that, sir.

97
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,888
What about Judy Garland?

98
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,933
We don’t have her either.

99
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,612
Do you have a guitar recording
by Roméo —

100
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,483
What’s his name?
Rafael Romero.

101
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,527
I’ll ask.

102
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,036
Rafael Romero on guitar.

103
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,535
In the bins in back.

104
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,696
ls Rita still sick?

105
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,483
Yes. I think she’ll be back
Thursday.

106
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,993
What a drag.
She owes me 2,000 francs.

107
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,956
- Can you lend me 2,000?
- You crazy? I’m broke.

108
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,085
Why? Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

109
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,669
Here it is.

110
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,384
I’ll take this too.

111
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,397
This way, sir.

112
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,032
That looks great.

113
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,949
The story’s stupid,
but it’s very well written.

114
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,458
“He gazed at the turquoise,
star-laden sky

115
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,584
and then turned to me.

116
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,043
‘You live your life intensely,
so logically —’

117
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,707
l interrupted him.

118
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,922
‘You attach
too much importance to logic.’

119
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:49,137
For a few seconds l was filled
with a bitter sense of triumph.

120
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,928
No more broken heart,
no more struggle to live again.

121
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,977
No probing questions to face
while masking one’s defeat.

122
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,860
Yes, a truly elegant way
of breaking this deadlock.”

THE CONCIERGE — PAUL —

125
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,566
Please give me my key.

126
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,698
All right, then.

127
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,996
Arthur! Get her!

128
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,378
Come on, give me the key.

129
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,669
Here, honey.

130
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,683
Hi.

131
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,097
Where are you headed?

132
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,263
Want to see the pictures?

133
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,525
He doesn’t look like me at all.
He looks more like you.

134
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,032
Come have dinner?

135
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,582
- Where are you going?
- Boulevard Saint-Michel.

136
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,326
- Come have dinner.
- I’m not hungry.

137
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,167
I want to see a movie.
Bye.

JOAN OF ARC

139
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,711
We have come
to prepare you for death!

140
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,431
Now... already?

141
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,272
How am I to die?

142
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,820
At the stake!

143
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,968
How can you still believe
you were sent by God?

144
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:26,691
God knows our path, but we understand it
only at the end of the road!

145
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,030
Yes, I am his child!

146
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,000
And the great victory?

147
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,559
It will be my martyrdom!

148
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,844
And your deliverance?

149
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,356
Death!

150
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,252
Death.

151
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,468
I said good-bye already.

152
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,432
I paid for your movie ticket.

153
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,267
Too bad.

154
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,733
Evening. How are you?

155
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,572
Evening. How are things?

156
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,825
- Didn’t we have a date tonight?
- Yes.

157
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,666
I wondered if you were coming.
- Why? Am I late?

158
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,580
Just a bit.
But that’s not why I wondered.

159
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,750
I’m usually very punctual.

160
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,628
11:00 pm. is very late.

161
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,889
I thought you’d forgotten too.

162
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,638
What will you have?

163
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,307
- Any rolls left?
- Sorry, no.

164
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,271
A coffee, then.

165
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,739
Was that a friend outside?

166
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,109
No, it was my brother.

167
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,865
You have lots
of brothers and sisters?

168
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,907
Five brothers and three sisters.

169
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,247
Surprised? It’s true.

170
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,289
What’s new since Wednesday?

171
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,004
Nothing much.

172
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,720
Is that red car outside yours?

173
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,807
What is it? A Jaguar?

174
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,471
No, an Alfa Romeo.
Are you interested in cars?

175
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,812
No, I don’t know
a thing about them.

176
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,816
When shall we take
those pictures?

177
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,991
You tell me.
I already told you I’m ready.

178
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,743
But I’m only free on Sundays.

179
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,614
I’m off to London on Sunday.

180
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,041
Well then, I don’t know.

181
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,835
How about now?
Are you tired?

182
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,386
If I say no,
you won’t think I’m awful?

183
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,591
Not at all.

184
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,593
Do you really think
I could get into films?

185
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,227
I think so.

186
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:53,515
Look, I brought you
a composite sheet.

187
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,784
I’d like to do
something like that.

188
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,197
What’s this for?

189
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,913
You send it out
to people in films,

190
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,879
and a few days later
maybe they call you.

191
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,838
I’m a bit shy
about undressing.

192
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,594
Just a little.
What can it hurt?

193
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,600
Could you lend me 2,000 francs?

194
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,056
I would, but I haven’t got it.

195
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,519
I’m tired.

196
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,526
What about my pictures?

197
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,532
You’ll come with me then?

198
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:08,928
THE POLICE —
NANA IS QUESTIONED

199
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,354
Nana Klein-what ?

200
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:21,311
K-L-E-I-N...

201
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:28,489
F-R-A-N-K-E-N...

202
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,620
H-E-I-M.

203
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:38,336
Born Apr/7 15th, 7940,
a! F/exburg, Mose/la.

204
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,213
No fixed address.
Is that ﬁght?

205
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,131
Yes.

206
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,797
A// ﬁght. What happened?

207
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,965
Well, I was walking
down the street,

208
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,054
and I saw a woman
buying a magazine.

209
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:58,564
Then... she took some money
out of her bag.

210
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,985
She didn’t notice
she’d dropped 1,000 francs.

211
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:09,659
So then... I pretended
to buy a magazine too,

212
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,487
and I put my foot
on her 1,000 francs.

213
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,326
She left and —

214
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,210
And she realized it?

215
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,522
She walked back toward me...

216
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,356
and stared into my eyes
for a long time.

217
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,407
So I gave her back her money.

218
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,376
Then why did she bring charges?

219
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,673
I don’t know.
I think it was very mean of her.

220
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,309
Don’t you have anyone
you can stay with in Paris?

221
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,437
Friends, sometimes.

222
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,273
Boys?

223
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,020
Sometimes.

224
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,693
Why not ask
for an advance at work?

225
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,413
I already have, too many times.

226
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,372
What are you going to do?

227
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,375
I don’t know.

228
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,294


229
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,839
l... is someone else.

230
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:02,932
THE BOULEVARDS —
THE FIRST MAN — THE ROOM

231
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,714
How about it?

232
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,474
Is this the place?

233
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,223
You’ve been here before?

234
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,899
Yes, it is.

235
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,584
Anyone there?

236
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,878
You want Room 27 or 28?

237
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,541
Room 27.

238
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,455
- Do you smoke?
- No, thanks.

239
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,917
There’s never an ashtray.

240
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,716
Here’s one.

241
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,855
How much do you want?

242
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,154
I don’t know.
It’s up to you.

243
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,860
I don’t know.

244
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,988
Four thousand francs?

245
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,841
You owe me 1,000.

246
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,806
l have no change.

247
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,438
Keep it.
It doesn’t matter.

248
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,567
It’s true.
I’m not just trying to get more.

249
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,728
But you have
to take everything off.

250
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,747
Why not on the mouth?

251
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,591
MEETING YVETTE —
A CAFE IN THE SUBURBS —

252
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:48,223
RAOUL —
GUNSHOTS IN THE STREET

253
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,487
Yvette! How are you?

254
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,487
Is that you? You cut your hair!
- A long time ago.

255
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,079
- How are you?
- And you?

256
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,536
- Oh, I’m getting by.
- Me too.

257
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,745
Good for you.

258
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,662
- Why?
- I thought that —

259
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,173
What are you doing here?

260
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,379
l’m thirsty.
Shall we get a drink?

261
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,009
I’d love to.

262
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,054
How’s Raymond?

263
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,762
Oh, I’ll tell you all about it.

264
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,222
What happened?

265
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,187
Life is cruel.

266
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:41,436
I’d like to get away,
escape to the tropics.

267
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,279
- Escape is a pipe dream.
- Why?

268
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,360
It just is.

269
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,239
This is it.

270
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,077
Shall we sit over there?

271
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,638
I’ll be back in a minute.

272
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,490
So tell me.

273
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,202
One evening, Raymond...

274
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,333
came home
with train tickets to Brest.

275
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,166
He said he had a job,
so we took the kids and moved

276
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:46,087
and went to live
in a hotel by the harbor.

277
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,720
He’d disappear
for the entire day.

278
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,173
He was “working.”

279
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,178
I’d take the children out,
buy them ice cream.

280
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,981
l was worried,

281
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,693
because I couldn’t figure out
how he earned his money.

282
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:09,277
One evening,
after three weeks of that,

283
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,609
he just never came back.

284
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,703
I had to manage on my own...

285
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,909
with the children that
my mother-in-law wouldn’t look after

286
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,203
because she didn’t like me.

287
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:27,883
l gradually became a prostitute.
It was the easiest way.

288
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:36,100
Then, two years later,
I went to the movies one night...

289
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,472
and saw him acting
in an American movie.

290
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,649
And things are fine now?

291
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,401
Everything’s fine.

292
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,232
What would you like?

293
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,693
- White wine.
- Rosé.

294
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,073
Still, it doesn’t sound
like much fun.

295
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,535
No, it’s depressing,
but it’s not my fault.

296
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,414
I think we’re always responsible
for our actions. We’re free.

297
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,175
I raise my hand —
l’m responsible.

298
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,964
I turn my head to the right —
l’m responsible.

299
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,306
l’m unhappy —
l’m responsible.

300
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,932
I smoke a cigarette —
l’m responsible.

301
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,025
I shut my eyes —
l’m responsible.

302
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,234
I forget that I’m responsible,
but I am.

303
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,905
I told you
escape is a pipe dream.

304
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,124
After all,
everything is beautiful.

305
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,086
You only have to take an interest
in things, see their beauty.

306
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,674
It’s true.

307
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,962
After all,
things are just what they are.

308
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,136
A face is a face.

309
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,968
Plates are plates.

310
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,137
Men are men.

311
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:07,065
And life... is life.

312
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,527
The guy I said hello to by the door
wants to meet you.

313
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,902
Would you mind?

314
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,570
Not at all.

315
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:41,012
My girl’s not the kind
to be seen

316
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,393
/n a chic magazine

317
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,428
That’s plain to see

318
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,223
N0 star/et’s
sung/asses or gowns

319
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,608
She works across town

320
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,519
/n a factory

321
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,359
Some p/ain furnished rooms
are our home

322
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,616
We live there alone

323
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,742
She and/

324
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,575
A warehouse
and rooftops below

325
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,286
From our little window

326
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,329
Meet the eye

327
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,953
l/acations we spend
close at hand

328
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,417
The Riv/era’s too grand

329
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,207
For our pay

330
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,044
Loved ones are distant and few

331
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,634
We a godmother who

332
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,140
Lives far away

333
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,555
But my girl, though just 25

334
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,970
is the sweetest that We

335
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,059
Ever seen

336
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,816
No saint in any church
you could find

337
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,273
is as sweet or as kind

338
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,187
At least to me

339
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:39,282
When the town dozes off
in the blaze

340
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,739
0f the sun is summer rays

341
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,699
Burning br/ght

342
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,410
With my baby girl
wrapped in my arms

343
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,997
/ drink in her charms

344
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,869
And hold her t/ght

345
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,663
We whisper our thoughts, she and/

346
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,333
As l/ght fades from the sky

347
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,251
Up above

348
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,921
in the secrecy of our four walls

349
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,465
As n/ght s/o w/y falls

350
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,058
We make love

351
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,352
Is she a lady or a tramp?

352
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,899
lnsu/t her. if she is a tramp,
she ’ll get angry

353
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,113
if she sm/les, she’s a lady.

354
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,778
Raoul.

355
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,957
A hot toddy.

356
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,841
We’ll find out.

357
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,470
You’re a friend of Yvette’s?

358
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,471
That’s right.

359
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,642
I know you very well.

360
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,526
- You’re lying.
- I saw you three months ago.

361
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,857
You’re lying.

362
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,150
A guy was showing you pictures
on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

363
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,818
That’s true.

364
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:09,323
Then why did you deny it?
You say any old nonsense.

365
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,163
You’re pathetic.

366
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,541
Why do you look at me like that?

367
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,503
You look stupid,
and your hair looks awful.

368
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,182
Wait here.
I need to talk to you.

369
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,217
You okay?

370
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,886
My eyes!

371
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:28,198
THE LETTER — RAOUL AGAIN —
THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES

372
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:13,906
Dear Madame, a friend who worked
for you gave me your address.

373
00:38:53,665 --> 00:39:00,503
I would like to come
and work for you.

374
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:16,852
I am 22 years old.

375
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:37,535
I think I am pretty.

376
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:49,377
My height is...

377
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,359
5’6”.

378
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,967
l have short hair...

379
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:59,113
but it grows very quickly.

380
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:20,469
Enclosed is a picture and...

381
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,188
Oh, it’s you.

382
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,275
The classic letter.

383
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,147
Yes, it’s me.

384
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,652
How did you know I was here?

385
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,449
I followed you.

386
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,950
l was in my car,
and I saw you come in here.

387
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,332
You’ve got some nerve.

388
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,213
No, you’re very beautiful.

389
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,058
You really skipped out quickly
the other day.

390
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,765
When?

391
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,684
When that crook was shot
outside the café.

392
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,149
You just vanished.

393
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,773
I don’t think they were crooks.
It was some political stuff.

394
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,531
Really? I didn’t know.

395
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:24,831
In any case,
I didn’t mean you aren’t brave.

396
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,038
l was just making conversation.

397
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,549
What do you think of me?

398
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,217
Me?

399
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,885
Yes, you.

400
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,515
I think there’s
a lot of goodness inside you.

401
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,854
What? A lot of what?

402
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:57,318
There’s a lot of goodness
in your eyes.

403
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,409
Really?
I didn’t understand.

404
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,032
Anyway,
that’s an odd thing to say.

405
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,743
Why?

406
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:19,343
I wasn’t expecting a Catholic response.
What I meant was:

407
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,756
Do you place me
in a special category of women?

408
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,274
You like being special?

409
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,145
Why?

410
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,822
No reason.

411
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:43,451
For me, there are
three types of girls:

412
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:51,034
those with one expression,
those with two, and those with three.

413
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,551
Did Yvette give you this address?

414
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,469
Are you really serious about it?

415
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,137
Why?

416
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,978
I’d like to earn more money.

417
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,812
I can help you earn
even more here in Paris.

418
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,652
Really? Fine with me.

419
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:38,172
Why not try to get into movies?
You’re a pretty girl.

420
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,424
I did try.

421
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,757
Two years ago,
I wanted to make it on the stage.

422
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:47,515
l was in Pacifico
at the Chatelet.

423
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,560
And I was in a film once
with Eddie Constantine.

424
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,019
I’m telling you my life story.
How awful.

425
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,695
No, it’s not. I’m a friend.

426
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,199
Give me a smile.

427
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,694
No, I don’t feel like it.

428
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,905
Shall I come with you?

429
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,704
When do lstart?

430
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,135
“When the city lights go on, the
streetwa/kers’ desperate rounds begin.”

431
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:19,934
AFTERNOONS — MONEY — SINKS —
PLEASURE — HOTELS

432
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,274
What exactly do / do ?

433
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,150
The prostitute earns all she can
by trading on her charms

434
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,491
to bu/ld up a good clientele and
establish the best working conditions.

435
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,367
Does she have
to be beautiful?

436
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:42,414
No, although beauty is an important
factor in a prostitute’s career.

437
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:47,836
lt establishes her place in the hierarchy
and attracts the attention of the pimp,

438
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:52,303
since her physical allure can be
a source of great proﬁt

439
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,517
Does she have
to register some where ?

440
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,888
Before the law
of Apr” 13th, 7946,

441
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,767
prostitutes were subject to medical
and police surve/l/ance.

442
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,902
Under the new law,
only medical surve/l/ance

443
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,817
is now required

444
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:12,236
The 7946 law and Decree 2253
of November 5th, 7 .94 7,

445
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:17,161
established the National Sanitary
Register for all women

446
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,285
shown by conclusive evidence

447
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,788
to be engaged in prostitution.

448
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,999
But what do / do?

449
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:31,012
Regardless of the ne/ghborhood
the procedure is the same.

450
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,094
By her dress,
attitude, and makeup,

451
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,763
the prostitute indicates
her trade.

452
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,928
Sometimes,
in defiance of the law,

453
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,190
she gestures to the client
or propositions him outr/ght.

454
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,352
What do / charge ?

455
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,987
it can vary greatly,

456
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,152
from 300 to 75, 000 francs

457
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:54,194
for an encounter lasting
from a few minutes to an hour

458
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,078
called a “trick. ”

459
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,207
An “overnight” ranges
from 5, 000 to 50, 000 francs.

460
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,327
Can / go anywhere l/rke?

461
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:07,215
Controls have been attempted
in Paris, for instance

462
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,172
a police regulation
of A ugust 25th, 7958,

463
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:15,261
forbids loitering
with intent to solicit

464
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,177
during certain hours
in the Bois de Bou/ogne

465
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,395
and around the Champs-Elyse’es.

466
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,772
Do lkeep a percentage?

467
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,227
A da/ly “quota”
is agreed upon in advance.

468
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,068
Around the Champs-Elyse’es
and the Madeleine,

469
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,233
it’s 20, 000
to 30, 000 francs a day,

470
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,618
paid at the end of the week.

471
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,287
Do lhave my own room?

472
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:43,209
Usual/y only the towels are changed
between tricks, not the sheets.

473
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,875
Some hotels provide no blankets,
only a bottom sheet.

474
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,589
What about the police ?

475
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,877
They conduct raids
and interrogations.

476
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,176
Any woman in violation
of regulations

477
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,842
can be detained in a clinic
as long as necessary

478
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,890
for extensive testing.

479
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,848
Can lha ve a drink
in a café ?

480
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,234
A prostitute who drinks hea vrly
earns very little.

481
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,772
She is undesirable
because she creates a scene.

482
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,110
What if / get pregnant?

483
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,784
One might think a prostitute
would seek an abortion at any cost.

484
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,744
That’s not the case.

485
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:29,915
They do try to avoid pregnancy,
by chemical means or any other.

486
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,793
But once pregnancy is conﬁrmed
abortions are rare.

487
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,296
Must / accept anyone ?

488
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:42,970
The prostitute must always be
at the client’s disposal.

489
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,642
She must accept anyone
who pays.

490
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,431
That man...

491
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,143
that man...

492
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,983
Are there clients every day?

493
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,948
Lower-grade prostitutes

494
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,163
average
five to e/ght clients a day,

495
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,041
earning 4, 000 to 8, 000 a day.

496
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,500
However, some manage
exceptional turnover.

497
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:14,167
Sixty clients is not unheard of
on Saturdays or holidays.

498
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:21,679
A YOUNG MAN — LUIGI — NANA
WONDERS WHETHER SHE’S HAPPY

499
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,759
Do / get days off?

500
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:27,138
Usual/y after the medical check.

501
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:31,229
Her man usually takes her out;

502
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:34,445
often to see her mm
in the country.

503
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,531
Afterwards, they go out
to a restaurant or a mo vie.

504
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,946
- ls Luigi here?
- Upstairs.

505
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,367
I’ll be five minutes.

506
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,878
The movie already started anyway.

507
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,999
A white wine.

508
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,604
Got any Gauloises?

509
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,910
- You have cigarettes?
- Yes. What kind?

510
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,079
l was just wondering.

511
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,389
- Got any cigarettes?
- They’ve got some downstairs.

512
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,313
- How are you?
- So-so.

513
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,481
What’s wrong with her?

514
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,817
We were supposed
to see a movie.

515
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,822
l’ll cheer you up.

516
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,703
I’ll do the kid
blowing up a balloon.

517
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,507
He’s got a balloon,
and he blows it up.

518
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,312
You ought to be my man.

519
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,932
Happy now?
Will you let us talk?

520
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:40,823
THE STREETS — A GUY —
HAPPINESS IS NO FUN

521
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,074
Did you see Inspector Fleytoux?
He bought a BMW.

522
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,783
They could have provided chairs.

523
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,035
It’s always like that.

524
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,752
How much?

525
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,664
3,000.
5,000 if I undress.

526
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:19,503
Can’t you give me one more?
- l have to keep some.

527
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,551
- One of these, then?
- It’s all I’ve got.

528
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,638
A little one.
It would be so nice.

529
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,518
You come here often?

530
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,110
But I’ve seen you before,
haventl?

531
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,812
Maybe.

532
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,033
What’s your name?

533
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,819
Dimitri.

534
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,697
Nice name.

535
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,459
Yes, I’m fond of it.

536
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,080
What line of work are you in?

537
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,090
I shoot pictures for ads.

538
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,125
You mean like in the movies?

539
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,260
No, still pictures.

540
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,057
l was in a movie with
Eddie Constantine two months ago.

541
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,135
No Pity.
Did you see it?

542
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:16,439
You don’t say much.
Are you the romantic type?

543
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,281
If you give me more,
you can stay.

544
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,876
That’s what you want?

545
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,704
I’ll go see.

546
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,589
Never mind.

547
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,645
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

548
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:02,481
- Can you spare five minutes?
- Ask Monique. She’s in 41.

549
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,788
- What’s up?
- Nothing.

550
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,009
The elevators never work.

551
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,009
See you Tuesday
at the Olympia.

552
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,818
- What are you doing?
- Going downstairs.

553
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,859
- Can you spare a moment?
- How much?

554
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,653
I don’t know.
We can discuss it.

555
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,329
All right.

556
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,494
Room 45.

557
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,184
Work it out with her.

558
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:26,148
- All right?
- Yes.

559
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:35,666
- What’s your name?
- Elizabeth. Like the Queen of England.

560
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,871
Shall I strip too?

561
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,789
Actually, don’t bother.

562
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:45,209
So you don’t need me anymore?

563
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,340
I don’t know.

564
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,270
Like that.

565
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:19,286
PLACE DU CHATELET — A STRANGER —
NANA, THE UNWITTING PHILOSOPHER

566
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,362
Do you mind me looking?

567
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,537
You look bored.

568
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,164
Not at all.

569
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:45,166
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

570
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,805
Will you buy me a drink?

571
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,266
if you l/ke.

572
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,976
Do you come here often?

573
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,146
Occasionally.
Today | just happened by.

574
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,983
Why are you reading?

575
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,822
It’s my job.

576
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,917
It’s funny.

577
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,082
Suddenly I don’t know what to say.

578
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:30,002
It happens to me a lot.

579
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,504
I know what I want to say.

580
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,888
I think first about whether
they’re the right words.

581
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,219
But when the moment comes
to speak, I can’t say it.

582
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,763
Yes, of course.

583
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,774
Have you read
The Three Musketeers?

584
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,186
No, but I saw the movie. Why?

585
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:57,283
Because in it, Porthos —

586
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,496
Actually, this is from
Twenty Years Later

587
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,579
Porthos is tall, strong,
and a little dense.

588
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,580
He’s never had a thought in his life.

589
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:15,798
He has to place a bomb
in a cellar to blow it up.

590
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,883
He does it.

591
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:22,471
He places the bomb, lights the fuse,
and starts to run away.

592
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,100
But just then he begins to think.

593
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,228
About what?

594
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:33,486
How it’s possible to put
one foot in front of the other.

595
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,318
I’m sure that’s happened to you.

596
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:42,408
So he stops running.
He can’t move fonNard.

597
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,160
The bomb explodes,
and the cellar caves in around him.

598
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,502
He holds it up
with his strong shoulders.

599
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:57,419
But after a day or two,
he’s crushed to death.

600
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,596
So the first time he thought,
it killed him.

601
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,467
Why do you tell me
things like that?

602
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:07,224
No reason. Just to talk.

603
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,889
Why must one always talk?

604
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,777
I think one should often
just keep quiet, live in silence.

605
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:19,407
The more one talks,
the less the words mean.

606
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,694
Perhaps,
but can one do that?

607
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,363
I don’t know.

608
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:29,285
It’s always struck me,
the fact we can’t live without speaking.

609
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,792
But it would be nice.

610
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,720
Yes, it would be nice, wouldn’t it?

611
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,431
Sort of like we loved
one another more.

612
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:47,719
But it’s impossible.
No one’s been able to.

613
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,391
But why?

614
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,729
Words should express
just what one wants to say.

615
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,064
Do they betray us?

616
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,067
Yes, but we betray them too.

617
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,403
One should be able
to express oneself.

618
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,944
We manage
to write things quite well.

619
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:07,990
It’s extraordinary
that someone like Plato

620
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:12,080
can still be understood.
People really do understand him.

621
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:16,123
Yet he wrote in Greek
2,500 years ago.

622
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:21,466
No one really knows
the language, not exactly.

623
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:26,175
Yet something gets through, so we
should be able to express ourselves.

624
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,765
And we have to.

625
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,932
Why do we have to?
To understand each other?

626
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,606
We must think,

627
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,733
and for thought we need words.

628
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,118
There’s no other way to think.

629
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,747
To communicate, one must speak.
That’s our life.

630
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,499
Yes, but at the same time,
it’s very hard.

631
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,624
Whereas I think
life should be easy.

632
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:07,800
Your tale about the Three Musketeers
may be a very nice story,

633
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,847
but it’s terrible.

634
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,763
Yes, but it’s a pointer.

635
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,807
I believe

636
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:22,322
one learns to speak well only when
one has renounced life for a while.

637
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,484
That’s the price.
- So to speak is fatal?

638
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,989
Speaking is almost
a resurrection in relation to life.

639
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,330
Speaking is a different life
from when one does not speak.

640
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:37,792
So to live speaking,

641
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:41,959
one must pass through
the death of life without speaking.

642
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,962
I don’t know if I’m being clear...

643
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:51,180
but there’s a kind of ascetic rule
that stops one from speaking well

644
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:55,021
until one sees life with detachment.

645
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,105
But one can’t live everyday life
with... I don’t know —

646
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,898
Detachment?

647
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:10,662
We go back and forth. That’s why
we pass from silence to words.

648
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:16,209
We swing between the two,
because it’s the movement of life.

649
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,713
From everyday life
one rises to a life —

650
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:25,422
Let’s call it superior — why not?
It’s the thinking life.

651
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:29,509
But the thinking life presupposes
that one has killed off

652
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,801
a life that’s too mundane,
too rudimentary.

653
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:38,435
Then thinking and speaking
are the same thing?

654
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,521
I believe so.

655
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:44,279
It’s in Plato, you know.
It’s an old idea.

656
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:48,237
I don’t think
one can distinguish a thought

657
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,868
from the words that express it.

658
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:57,084
A moment of thought can only
be grasped through words.

659
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,869
So to speak is to risk lying?

660
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,959
Lies too are part of our quest.

661
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,422
There’s little difference
between an error and a lie.

662
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:11,181
I don’t mean ordinary lies,
like promising,

663
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:15,764
“I’ll be here tomorrow at 5:00,”
and then not showing up.

664
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,974
Those are just ploys.

665
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:24,486
But a subtle lie
often differs little from an error.

666
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:28,614
One’s searching for something
and can’t find the right word.

667
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:33,074
That’s why you didn’t know
what to say before.

668
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:37,115
I think you were afraid
of not finding the right word.

669
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:43,371
How can one be sure
of having found the right word?

670
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:49,552
One must work at it.
It only comes with effort.

671
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:54,261
To say what must be said
in the appropriate way,

672
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,509
that is, that doesn’t hurt,

673
01:11:56,646 --> 01:12:00,104
that says what must be said,
does what must be done,

674
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,770
without hurting
or wounding anyone.

675
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,608
One must try to act in good faith.

676
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,986
Someone once told me,

677
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,994
“There’s truth in everything,
even in error.”

678
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,242
It’s true.

679
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:21,329
That’s what France didn’t see
in the 17th century.

680
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:26,123
They thought one could
avoid errors and lies,

681
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,463
that one could live
directly in the truth.

682
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,343
I don’t think it’s possible.

683
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,631
Hence Kant, Hegel,
German philosophy:

684
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,596
to bring us back to life

685
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:42,981
and make us see that we must pass
through error to arrive at truth.

686
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,861
What do you think about love?

687
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,239
The body had to come into it,

688
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,155
andindeed,
Leibniz introduced the contingent.

689
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:02,701
Contingent truths
and necessary truths make up life.

690
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:06,872
German philosophy
showed us that in life,

691
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:11,088
one thinks with the constraints
and errors of life.

692
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:14,550
One must manage with that.
It’s true.

693
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:20,302
Shouldn’t love be the only truth?

694
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,019
But for that,
love would always have to be true.

695
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:30,232
Do you know anyone who knows
right off what he loves?

696
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,323
No. When you’re 20,
you don’t know.

697
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,577
All you know are bits and pieces.
You grasp at experience.

698
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:42,332
At that age, “I love”
is a mixture of many things.

699
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:48,542
To be completely at one
with what you love takes maturity.

700
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:50,877
That means searching.

701
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,134
That’s the truth of life.

702
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,259
That’s why love is a solution,

703
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,641
but on the condition that it be true.

704
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:10,319
THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN — THE OVAL
PORTRAIT — RAOUL TRADES NANA

705
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,279
What shall we do today?

706
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:24,369
I don’t know.

707
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,788
Shall we go
to the Luxembourg Garden?

708
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,457
I think it’s going to rain.

709
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:38,755
“/ thus saw in vivid lrght
a picture all unnoticed before.

710
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:43,934
It was the portrait of a young girl
just ripening into womanhood.

711
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:48,606
I glanced at the painting hurriedly,
and then closed my eyes.

712
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,361
It was an impulsive movement
to gain time for thought,

713
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,201
to make sure that my vision
had not deceived me,

714
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:10,336
to calm and subdue my fancy
for a more sober and more certain gaze.

715
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:15,501
In a very few moments
I again looked fixedly at the painting.

716
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:25,935
The portrait, l have already said,
was that of a young girl.

717
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,931
It was a mere head and shoulders,

718
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:34,227
done in what is technically
termed a vignette manner,

719
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,698
much in the style
of the favorite heads of Sully.

720
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:43,202
The arms, the bosom,
and even the ends of the radiant hair

721
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:47,456
melted imperceptibly
into the vague yet deep shadow

722
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,912
which formed
the background of the whole.

723
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:54,171
As a thing of art,
nothing could be more admirable

724
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,582
than the painting itself.

725
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,628
But it could have been
neither the execution of the work,

726
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,888
nor the immortal beauty
of the countenance,

727
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,517
which had so suddenly
and so vehemently moved me.

728
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:11,056
Least of all could it have been that
my fancy, shaken from its half slumber,

729
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,350
had mistaken the head
for that of a living person.

730
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,324
At length, satisfied
with the true secret of its effect,

731
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:25,077
I fell back within the bed.

732
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,080
I had found the spell of the picture

733
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:33,415
in an absolute life-likeliness
of expression.”

734
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,462
Is that your book?

735
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,624
No, I found it here.

736
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,639
Can I have one?

737
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:59,362
It’s our story:
a painter portraying his love.

738
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,735
Shall I go on?

739
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:08,996
“And in sooth
some who beheld the portrait

740
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,959
spoke of its resemblance
in low words as of a mighty marvel,

741
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,292
and a proof not less
of the power of the painter

742
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:20,959
than of his deep love for her
whom he depicted so surpassingly well.

743
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:25,463
But at length, as the labor drew
nearer to its conclusion,

744
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,132
there were admitted none
into the turret.

745
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,393
For the painter had grown wild
with the ardor of his work,

746
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:37,025
and turned his eyes from the canvas
rarely, even to regard his wife.

747
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:41,107
And he would not see that the tints
which he spread upon the canvas

748
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:45,366
were drawn from the cheeks of her
who sat beside him.

749
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:50,913
And when many weeks had passed,
and but little remained to do,

750
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:55,126
save one brush upon the mouth
and one tint upon the eye,

751
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:59,539
the spirit of the lady again flickered up
as the flame within a lamp.

752
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:04,378
And then the brush was given,
and then the tint was placed.

753
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,089
And, for one moment,
the painter stood entranced

754
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,758
before the work he had wrought.

755
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,099
But in the next, while he yet gazed,

756
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,980
he grew tremulous and aghast,

757
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:21,352
and crying with a loud voice,
“This is indeed Life itself!”

758
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,863
turned suddenly to regard his beloved:

759
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,024
She was dead!”

760
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,536
I’d like to go to the Louvre.

761
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,793
No, I don’t like looking at pictures.

762
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,462
Why? Art and beauty are life!

763
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,638
I adore you.

764
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,428
And I love you.

765
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,063
Why not come and live with me?

766
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:08,899
Yes. I’ll tell Raoul it’s all over.

767
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,203
Let me at least put my coat on
or I’ll catch cold!

768
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,295
Stop acting hysterical.

769
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,047
No, Raoul, not now!

770
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,181
Stop acting hysterical!

771
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,555
You know each other?

772
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,945
What did I do wrong?

773
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,164
You must take anyone who pays.

774
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:00,872
Not anyone.
Sometimes it’s degrading.

775
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,788
See? That’s where you’re wrong.

776
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,466
The movies are a drag.
Weekdays we’re too busy,

777
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,135
and on Sundays
there’s always a line.

778
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,646
- Where are you going?
- Taking them back to their car.

779
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,311
Why did you make me come?

780
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,856
You’re going with them.

781
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:34,319
HADES AND SONS

782
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,349
Well, are you going?

783
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,567
First the girl.

784
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,745
First the money.

785
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,217
Get the money.

786
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,332
There’s 100,000 missing.

787
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,254
Don’t move.

788
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:53,711
Don’t think I won’t shoot
just because of the girl.

789
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,672
No, don’t shoot me!

790
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,427
You shoot.
I forgot to load.

1
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,300
GORGEOUS

2
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,660
Attention, please!

3
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,500
We have a special message
for all our dear, faithful listeners!

4
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,100
Fathers, mothers, relatives!

5
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,020
Stella Film has organized
a great contest

6
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,580
to find a little girl,
a child from 6 to 8 years of age,

7
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,780
a pretty little Italian girl.

8
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,620
Bring your daughter to Stella Film,

9
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
to Cinecittà offices,
Via Tuscolana, km 9.

10
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,740
It could turn your luck
and hers around!

11
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
All the girls from 6 to 8 years,

12
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,500
can enter the theatre,
quietly and calmly

13
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,620
to be seen by
the film director Blasetti!

14
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,700
Now, go along inside!

15
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,820
Hurry! Hurry! Move along there!

16
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,860
Vito!

17
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,060
Where is this little girl?

18
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,220
- What's her name?
- Maria Cecconi.

19
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,900
Maria Cecconi!

20
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,700
Quiet, please! Quiet!

21
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,900
There! Good manners will get you far.

22
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,180
You will get your daughters
tested by us,

23
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,300
as you'd like, quietly and calmly.

24
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,060
We'll be able to see them better.
Right? Fine!

25
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
- Ready?
- Ready!

26
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,780
Glori, send over the first child.

27
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,540
Let's see the first child. Come on!

28
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,500
What can you do?

29
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,180
I can do an imitation
of Betty Grable.

30
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Good! Go on!

31
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,300
Very good!

32
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Well done! You're starting early,
how old are you?

33
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,500
- Eleven.
- Eleven! Give her a number.

34
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
Next!
Another child, hurry!

35
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,580
Be quiet over there!

36
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,140
Fine... Keep that child quiet!

37
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
- What can you do?
- "Arrivano I nostri".

38
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,780
Perfect!
Sing "Arrivano I nostri". Go!

39
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,060
Fine!

40
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
- Very good!
- Her voice is a little low!

41
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,620
- We need a louder voice.
- Louder!

42
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,420
Very good! Give her the number.
Next!

43
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,380
Please, be quiet over there!

44
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,340
Good, you with the Chinese hat!
Quiet!

45
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,100
Incredible! I've been looking
for you for three hours!

46
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,020
How could I go home without you?
Look what a mess you're in!

47
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,660
Just look what a mess you're in!
Stand up!

48
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,540
You deserve a good smack!
Now you're crying?

49
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,660
Look at you! Damn!

50
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,980
You're all dirty. You drive me crazy!

51
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,820
- They called you over the megaphone!
- Mummy!

52
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,820
What do you want from Mummy?

53
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,620
What did she do wrong?

54
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,660
She nearly gave me a heart attack.

55
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,940
I've been looking for her
all over Cinecittà!

56
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
They won't let us back in.
Are you happy?

57
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,820
- Are you here for the contest?
- Yes! Look what a mess she's in.

58
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,860
She looks like St. Lazarus!
Come here!

59
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,860
If I had to take a child to the
contest, I'd leave her like that.

60
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,820
All dirty? Beautiful!

61
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,140
They're prettier grubby and with
their hair tossed. They look nicer.

62
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,820
It's you who's nice.

63
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,060
She has a pretty face.

64
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,260
She's photogenic.
And she has lovely eyes.

65
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,140
Let me see!
Really lovely eyes!

66
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,420
Good thing! Let's hope they pick you.
Come on!

67
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
- Goodness! I'm lost now.
- I think they're at n. 5.

68
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
- What's that?
- Studio n. 5.

69
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
How do I get there?
I'm completely lost!

70
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,900
- I'll take you there.
- You will?

71
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,340
- Sure.
- How kind! Thanks. Let's go!

72
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,140
Wait till we get home!

73
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,860
This is the little girl who got lost!

74
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,900
- The lady can go in through here.
- If you say so!

75
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,220
I brought some photos of her.
Did I do the right thing?

76
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,820
- She really is a pretty child!
- At this age, they're all pretty!

77
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,580
Right. They're all pretty,
but I prefer their mothers!

78
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,380
Listen, allow me to give you
a piece of advice:

79
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,740
the second time
the test will be a bit harder

80
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,060
and these photos
won't help you much.

81
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,980
- They're not very good.
- Yes.

82
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,620
You need to get them re-done larger
and better by a professional.

83
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,220
- I will.
- I can give you an address.

84
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,180
- That'd be great!
- Tell him I sent you.

85
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm Alberto Annovazzi.

86
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,060
The photographer
is at 14, Via Quattro Fontane.

87
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Go to him. He's a real artist.

88
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,020
I'll go there! Thank you so much.

89
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,580
- Not at all.
- I don't know how to thank you.

90
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,220
- Can I go in?
- It leads straight to the studio.

91
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,780
- If I hadn't run into you...
- Best of luck!

92
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,860
- Say bye-bye!
- Bye! Don't run off again.

93
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,900
- I'll hold onto her tight!
- That's best.

94
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,940
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

95
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,100
Good. Well done, little one!
What's your name?

96
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
Mario! Give her a number.

97
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,980
Now, the other little girl
who is waiting her turn.

98
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,020
Come forward.
Madam, we're not at the races!

99
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,860
The incident's over!
Go back to your places! Enough!

100
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,140
Back to your places!
The incident is over!

101
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,180
This is the child who got lost!

102
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,140
- Ah, that one!
- I lost sight of her!

103
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,340
- Where?
- I don't know!

104
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,060
- It's a village, you can get lost.
- Where was she?

105
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,060
- Near the pool!
- Silence, please!

106
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,340
For goodness' sake! Quiet!
Where did you find her?

107
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,860
- Near the pool, fishing!
- She got dirty.

108
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,140
Yes. I struggle to iron her dress!

109
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,020
- Cute! What's your name?
- Maria!

110
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,300
- He didn't catch that.
- Maria!

111
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,020
Nice! Maria what?

112
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,420
- Maria...
- Zecconi!

113
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,740
- Zecconi!
- No. She lisps slightly.

114
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
- So, what's her surname?
- Cecconi.

115
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,300
Cecconi.
Repeat: "Maria Cecconi".

116
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,900
Okay, maybe she likes that way.

117
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,180
When I made the announcement
you were looking for your girl,

118
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,740
but I said the child has to be
6-7 years old and no younger!

119
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,260
- Mr. Blasetti, she's 7.
- She's a little...

120
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,540
You find her small?

121
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,260
The dress makes her look small.

122
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,220
To tell the truth,
she hasn't grown much this year!

123
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,740
She will. For sure!
What are you going to do for us?

124
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Do you dance? Sing? Or what?

125
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,140
- Venice.
- You're doing Venice!

126
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,020
Mr. Blasetti won't understand!

127
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,660
- The poem on Venice!
- Fine! Off you go!

128
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,740
- Do you want to hear it?
- Of course!

129
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,620
<i>Venice, your final hour has come</i>

130
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,340
<i>Illustrious martyr, you are lost</i>

131
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>The plague is spreading,
we are starving,</i>

132
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>A white flag
is fluttering on the bridge</i>

133
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,900
Did you teach her that?

134
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,860
Did you teach her that?
She's a star!

135
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,860
She didn't recite it that well
even at Christmas!

136
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,020
Come on, don't waste time. It's 2pm.

137
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,340
If we get to the stadium late,
it'll be full,

138
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
we'll be standing like idiots!
Hurry up!

139
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,540
I've had enough,
I don't feel like coming.

140
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,860
What?
You're not coming to the match?

141
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Bruno, did you hear him?

142
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,140
There's nothing odd about it.
I'm worried.

143
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,380
She's been out since this morning
and she has the child with her.

144
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,300
Why hasn't she turned up?
I'm not coming, don't insist!

145
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,300
She said: "I'm going to give
an injection in Monteverde".

146
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,700
Where do you expect her to go?

147
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,700
What's the point of going
as far as Monteverde to give shots?

148
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,380
It's Sunday and the tram
costs 20 cents each way,

149
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,140
and the child pays full fare.

150
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Your wife is nuts!
Come on, Franco, drink your coffee.

151
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,780
See what you've done?
This idiot's always laughing!

152
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,940
- Drink your coffee!
- Can't you see it's boiling?

153
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,780
Mum, it's best not to fret over her.

154
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,140
- She does as she likes anyway.
- Make her respect you!

155
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Right! Make her respect you!
Once and for all!

156
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Do you know what I think?
She didn't go to Monteverde!

157
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,660
What are you saying?
She has your daughter with her.

158
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,780
That's the reason!
Because she has the child with her!

159
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Come on! Let's go! It's 3pm
and we're still chatting! It's late!

160
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's go, Spartaco! Hurry!

161
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Give her another kiss!
Mum, you're always the same!

162
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,380
- I dropped food on myself.
- I'll clean you up. Bye!

163
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,780
- Won't you kiss my forehead?
- Bye! Don't catch too much sun!

164
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,540
- Don't worry!
- When you see Maddalena...

165
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,780
I'll tell her not to bring
the child with her any more.

166
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,220
- She hasn't eaten yet!
- Don't take it out on her.

167
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,900
I won't, don't worry.
Bye-bye. See you soon.

168
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,540
- Have a good time!
- Come on!

169
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,340
Spartaco! Your wife's there!

170
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,020
There she is!

171
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,340
- I want to know where you've been!
- Spartaco!

172
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,380
Slow down!
You're in such a hurry now.

173
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,220
- I did go!
- Where?

174
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,500
To Cinecittà,
for the film role contest!

175
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,700
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy or not, they picked her!

176
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,300
- Who?
- Our daughter, not me! If only!

177
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,300
Don't tell lies.
You're always telling fibs!

178
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,940
Leave her be, she always does what
she wants. And she's always talking!

179
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,380
Let's go, the match is starting.

180
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,380
Why don't you mind
your own business?

181
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,780
Don't you talk
to my brother like that.

182
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm coming with you.

183
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,020
No, you go home
and feed the child.

184
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,620
- Your mother can do it.
- You feed her!

185
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,100
- Take me to the movies tonight!
- I'll give you the movies!

186
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,340
We'll discuss tonight.
Let's go, Franco!

187
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,740
- What needs discussing?
- She's always talking!

188
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,940
- Cut it out!
- Bye, Maddalena.

189
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
We're going to the movies, right?

190
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,900
Be serious and take the child home
to feed her!

191
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,500
You grouch! Come on! Bye!

192
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,180
Two, three, four.

193
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,340
One, two, three, four.

194
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Mrs. Molteni!

195
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,740
What do you want, Maria?

196
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,580
I can't hear you! Shout louder!

197
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,500
They start waking people up
very early in the morning, dammit!

198
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,220
What do you want, Maria?

199
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,340
- Is my mother up there?
- No, she's not here, Maria!

200
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,740
She's at Margherita's giving her
an injection. I'll call her.

201
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,660
Mrs. Maddalena!

202
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,500
- What's up?
- Maria's looking for you!

203
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,700
- Who?
- Your daughter's looking for you!

204
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,380
What do you want?

205
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,580
Mummy, there is a lady
who wants coffee!

206
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,340
- I can't understand you! What?
- A lady wants coffee!

207
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,060
You're holding me up. I'm giving
an injection. I'll be right down.

208
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Be good, now!
Thank you so much, Madam.

209
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,940
Mummy's on her way.

210
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,060
She's giving a lady an injection.

211
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,140
You see this egg?

212
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,060
God sees and provides.

213
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,100
- Your daughter's been calling you.
- I know!

214
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,860
Is she ill?

215
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,620
She's fine, she was picked!
We're going to the photographer.

216
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,500
When are you going to have
this baby? Hurry up!

217
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,780
You're always on the stairs.
Go home!

218
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,820
Mrs. Gisella, please, ask your
daughter to do Maria's homework.

219
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,060
We're going to the photographer's.
She was picked! Bye-bye!

220
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,180
She's mad! That fanatic!

221
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
For heaven's sake, don't choke!

222
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,300
Is this the lady
who wanted some coffee?

223
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,940
Do excuse me. I had
a sort of cramp in my stomach.

224
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,500
I asked for a drop of coffee.

225
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,740
We don't have any. We do have
some eggs, but I see that...

226
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,180
- They're better.
- Yes, I know they're better.

227
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,100
- Excuse me, but who are you?
- How silly of me, you don't know me.

228
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm Tilde Spernanzoni.

229
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,020
The actress.

230
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,220
- What?
- The actress.

231
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,860
I've given up the stage now,
I'm tired.

232
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,780
When you get to a certain age,
you have to rest.

233
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,700
Anyway, you have to make way
for the young.

234
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,540
I do a little film work.

235
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,860
Mummy!

236
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,660
- The lady drank an egg.
- It doesn't matter. Don't worry.

237
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,860
Little blabbermouth!

238
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,940
This is the child who was chosen
for the second test?

239
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,740
Dear lady, who sent you here?
Cinecittà? Stella Film? Who?

240
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,900
No one.

241
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,020
Someone must have sent you.
You're wasting my time!

242
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,220
An acquaintance gave me the names
of the ones who were chosen.

243
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
She's pretty, very pretty.

244
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,380
Take my hand, dear.
Give me your hand. Good girl!

245
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,740
While Mummy's making some coffee
with lots of sugar,

246
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,100
you'll recite something for me.

247
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,820
It's nice here! You have a garden!
Wonderful! Will you come with me?

248
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,660
- Let's go into the garden.
- Yes, it's a real palace!

249
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,300
Thank goodness we're moving.
Where are you going?

250
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,020
I've already asked
and she doesn't need lessons.

251
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,020
They want her just as she is,

252
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,580
provided she's bright
and intelligent. Look at her face.

253
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,740
My daughter doesn't need coaching.
Anyway, we can't afford it.

254
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,180
I see, but for our children
we can make sacrifices.

255
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,620
- But...
- Our children are our children!

256
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,620
Come here, dear, come here!

257
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,340
Have you turned up to teach me
how to bring up children?

258
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,340
You're holding us up.
We're going to the photographer.

259
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,540
How else can I put it to you?
Be reasonable!

260
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,300
- You'll go there later.
- What?

261
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,700
Where are you going?

262
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,540
Maria, recite
"The final hour of Venice".

263
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,500
She'll be satisfied and we can go!

264
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,860
What a clever girl!
Say "The final hour of Venice".

265
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,020
- I want to hear that poem.
- Who ever sent her here?

266
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,340
Who ever sent that mad woman
to my house?

267
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,660
You come home happy and
you find a mad woman in the house.

268
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,260
"I'm an actress..." She tells you
her life history. "I'm retired..."

269
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,180
I've so many problems of my own,
I'll give her coffee so she'll go.

270
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,140
How much time we're wasting here!
"I'm tired", "Now I'm teaching"...

271
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,140
But she's far from being mad!

272
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,540
You're tired,
but you drank three eggs!

273
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,260
What bad manners! How uncouth!
I'd best lock the meat up.

274
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,260
Now, we're wasting half an hour
to let her hear a poem?

275
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,620
It's simply incredible!

276
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,900
We'll miss our appointment
with the photographer!

277
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,860
Have you nothing better to do?
In this heat!

278
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,580
It's nice and cool at the park!
Instead of drinking others' eggs!

279
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
This really bothers me!

280
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,140
I can't accept it!

281
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,780
- Excuse me! Listen!
- Is the coffee ready?

282
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,100
I'm making it. Do you want it sweet?
With lots of sugar?

283
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,740
The little girl is talented.

284
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,940
But she'll get to poetry later!
Now, it's too soon.

285
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,420
It's tiring for her.

286
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,220
I'll teach her something myself.

287
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,580
We'll find a suitable,
quiet spot. Let's see.

288
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,060
Here we are! Take my hand, dear.
Come with me.

289
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,820
Come with me, here we are!
You'll see what I have to teach you.

290
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,700
This is an ideal spot.

291
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,780
Come with me. Good girl!

292
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,580
Imagine you're in a meadow,

293
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:07,300
a large, green meadow
that's cool, like here.

294
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,420
You're here to pick strawberries.

295
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,100
Excuse me! Excuse me!
She's even deaf.

296
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,940
The first exercise is
in role-playing.

297
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,740
Imagining yourself in a situation.
Do you like strawberries?

298
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,540
So you're happy
to pick strawberries.

299
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,780
Oh! Look how many strawberries
there are under that oak!

300
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,500
She's mad!
Where can she see an oak?

301
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,780
Run, run! Pick them! Go on!
Bend down, there's a good girl.

302
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,900
Pick them! There are so many!
Look how many there are!

303
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,820
And that silly girl listens to her.

304
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,340
Excuse me,
but you're sapping her brain.

305
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,220
Maria, what are you up to?
What are you doing?

306
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,380
She's picking strawberries,
isn't she?

307
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Can't you see
she's picking strawberries?

308
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,540
Give it to me. What a lovely one!
Bend down and pick it, dear.

309
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,060
You see?

310
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,140
- They don't understand anything.
- If she doesn't leave...

311
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,860
Maria, hurry!

312
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,060
How long does it take you
to come here, sweetheart? Hurry!

313
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Come on, you're making me late.

314
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,980
She drove us both crazy.
Who is that woman?

315
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,620
You must only listen to Mummy.
You're making me late! Come on!

316
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,380
Goodness me...

317
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Wash your hands.
Wait! Let Mummy pour the water.

318
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,860
Pick up the soap! Be quick!

319
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,300
Look what a state you're in.
Where did you go, in the coal shed?

320
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,020
Oh, what a slowcoach!

321
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,820
Can't you go any faster?
Now, rinse your hands properly.

322
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,420
Give your face a wash too.
Look what a state you're in.

323
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,340
Hurry, while Mummy gets ready.

324
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,620
How odd that woman is!

325
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,060
"Honey, pick the strawberries".
She was just pretending!

326
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,820
She was teaching you to act.
Yes, right, to act.

327
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,420
What is there to acting?

328
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,660
If I thought I was someone else,

329
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,940
if I pretended
to be someone else,

330
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,580
I'd be acting.

331
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,060
You're not interested, are you?

332
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,580
It's like when you say that poem,
the one about the butterfly.

333
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,180
"I'm a butterfly,
half white and half yellow."

334
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,820
The one you recite with
your hands like that! Show me!

335
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,580
I'm a butterfly,
half white and half yellow.

336
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,940
How do you move your hands?

337
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,580
My goodness!
You see that you can act!

338
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,140
You see you can act too?

339
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,740
But don't stutter, sweetheart,
otherwise they won't pick you?

340
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,580
You must speak without stuttering.
Do you understand?

341
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Picking strawberries...
Listen to your Mummy.

342
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,780
All the mothers in this block
make me laugh:

343
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
"My daughter, my daughter..."
They don't have what it takes!

344
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,020
You're my daughter,
you certainly can be an actress!

345
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,340
You can be an actress, you know?

346
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,940
I could have, if I'd wanted to.

347
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,060
Come here and let me fix your hair.
What a mess you're in!

348
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,340
How would you look
with a centre parting?

349
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Oh, Lord! You look ugly like that!

350
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,580
No, let's leave it.
All combed back, like Mummy!

351
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,740
Let's see.

352
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,780
Let's see how you look.
My beautiful potato!

353
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,060
Let's fix your plaits.

354
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,980
Let me see.

355
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,220
These plaits!

356
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
But... But you're cute!

357
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,820
You look pretty like that!
You look simpler and more natural.

358
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,180
Today, we'll just do the photo.
We can't afford anything else.

359
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,060
Understood? Understood?

360
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,060
Mummy, am I going back
to school tomorrow?

361
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,700
Oh, my Goodness! You're stuttering
and lisping. What are we to do?

362
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,940
Repeat it.

363
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,620
Louder!

364
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,300
What are you up to?
Are you doing it on purpose?

365
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,900
You never stuttered before.
You never lisped.

366
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,740
Pronounce it properly.

367
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
You can't speak Roman dialect
if you want to be an actress!

368
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,540
What's happening here?
Come here, next to Mummy.

369
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
This is a problem a real problem.

370
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,140
No, no, without lisping!

371
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
You're making me lisp too!
What's going on?

372
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Here! Take your shoes
and go and get dress in there.

373
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
Put on your socks and shoes.

374
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,780
Then put on the dress
that's on the coffee table.

375
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Don't toss your hair!

376
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,660
Do you have to stand there every
time I open the window? Scram!

377
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,860
What a brazen boy! At his age!

378
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,500
What a house this is! It's crazy!
They come right into your flat!

379
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,620
I'm lisping too! Really!

380
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,100
What's going on here?

381
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,140
Are you ready?

382
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,500
Don't toss your hair putting on
your dress, or you'll get a smack!

383
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,180
That's too high a pitch! Ready?

384
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,220
We have to do everything
in a hurry...

385
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,980
You're still there!
You're bothering me.

386
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,300
Supposing that mad woman's right?
Maybe you do need to study...

387
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,500
Is lisping a family trait?
Are you ready?

388
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,820
What's she like?

389
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,580
Show me.

390
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,820
There she is! Just a moment.

391
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,700
- What pose are you putting her in?
- This one. How's that?

392
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,980
That's not suitable!

393
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:15,340
- Put her in the tomboy one.
- Don't interfere!

394
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,780
Sorry. My wife's been an invalid
so long, she likes to get involved.

395
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,220
Let's hurry, now!
Would you like to choose a pose?

396
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,820
- Now, poppet, sit up straight!
- Put her in the pose I suggested!

397
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,580
I thought you knew each other.
That would be normal,

398
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,740
both here for the contest
and acquaintances of Annovazzi.

399
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,260
Me? I hardly know him.

400
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,820
Lift up your chin, won't you?
Come on!

401
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,980
Lift up your chin!
Keep your head straight!

402
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,540
I met him at Cinecittà
and he was interested in my girl.

403
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,340
Look over there, over there.
Don't cry!

404
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,580
Mummy's sweetheart!
Let's take a nice picture.

405
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,780
It was he who advised me
to come to you.

406
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Because he particularly liked
her eyes.

407
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,060
Why are you crying, sweetheart?

408
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,340
Poor thing, she's not used to this
and she's a little scared!

409
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,580
Smile, come on! Smile!

410
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,580
Your daughter takes ballet classes.

411
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,580
They have to dance in the film.

412
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,820
- Not at all! Who said it?
- I thought they did!

413
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,380
Because one of the little girls
I photographed

414
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,900
was from the Opera school.

415
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,220
- The Ruskaja School.
- No, the Opera school!

416
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,500
- The Ruskaja School!
- That woman!

417
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,820
Excuse me, but are you sure
they have to dance?

418
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,620
In the novel the film is based on
the little girl dances.

419
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,580
I've read it!
That's exactly how it starts!

420
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,980
I do believe you're mistaken.
I don't want to insist.

421
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,500
It starts with her saying
she can't stand it any more.

422
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,100
Yes, it starts like that,

423
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,100
then the girl dances around
the table on her birthday.

424
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,220
No. She tells him she's leaving him.
He wants to kill her.

425
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,980
The girl is very happy
because it's her birthday.

426
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,340
She's cheerful and dances and hops,
there's a cake on the table!

427
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,780
In the book, the girl dances!

428
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,020
Excuse me.

429
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,380
Anyhow, if they can dance,
it'll be for the better, won't it?

430
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,820
No, she doesn't have to dance!

431
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,780
- Ready?
- Wait! I just need to settle her!

432
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,980
- A big smile!
- Please step aside!

433
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,060
A big smile! Look at the camera,
he'll take a nice photo of you!

434
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,580
There we are!

435
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,540
- You nearly set me on fire!
- It all went fine!

436
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,860
The bang will have frightened her
and she'll have closed her eyes!

437
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,820
No, they were wide open!

438
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
- Did you watch them carefully?
- Don't worry!

439
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,700
- They're what I'm worried about!
- I'm busy now.

440
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,740
- I'm the photographer!
- No need to lose your patience!

441
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,700
Now it's the turn of the pretty girl.

442
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,700
- How did you have your eyes?
- Open.

443
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,420
You tell so many lies.
Were you feeling afraid?

444
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,380
We risk wasting time
and money here. Excuse me...

445
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,980
When shall I come
for the negatives?

446
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,140
- This evening. Tomorrow, rather.
- This evening, please!

447
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Why not yesterday?
I can't do them for this evening!

448
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,660
- Come tomorrow, they'll be ready.
- You're so kind!

449
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,260
Do you want to take it home?
Mummy will get you one like it!

450
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,780
It's really late, now.
Daddy will be starving!

451
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,900
- Goodbye! Thank you.
- Goodbye.

452
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,700
You know what the photos are for.
I'm in your hands!

453
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,020
Don't worry.

454
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,700
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Say goodbye to the gentleman!

455
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,500
Are you ready for your shot?

456
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,140
- Yes I am!
- So am I, I'm almost ready.

457
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,660
- Thank goodness.
- Decide where you want to have it.

458
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,020
I have. On the right again.

459
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,900
Always on the right!
You're full of holes there!

460
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,780
It hurts on the other side!

461
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,540
Very well. The right side it is!
But if it hurts, don't complain!

462
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,060
- What is it? Penicillin?
- No, we've finished with that.

463
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,180
You've had 8 million shots.

464
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,180
- So what are you giving me?
- We're back on Balerofosforo!

465
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,300
- I've had a whole box of that!
- You need another. You're run-down!

466
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,860
Look at the white of your eyes!

467
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,820
You're heavy,
but you have no strength!

468
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,220
Let's hope it helps!

469
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,060
What a chatterbox! I'm wasting time
here and I've so much to do!

470
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,500
Are you ready?
I must ask you for a favour.

471
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,620
- May I make a phone call?
- Of course! Naturally!

472
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,060
You're still lying there?
Come on! Show me where you want it!

473
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,140
I must phone my daughter.

474
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,260
We had the photos done!
They came out very well.

475
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,420
Don't hold me up, now!
Come on! Turn over!

476
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,980
Careful with that
or you'll set fire to the bed!

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,900
Hurry up! Turn over!

478
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,700
- Come on, skinny!
- Don't hurt me!

479
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,660
You're nice and plump!
Who enjoys all this abundance?

480
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,340
- Relax your leg.
- Don't hurt me!

481
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,820
Don't delay me. I must stop in on
the Commendatore.

482
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,180
- What's he got?
- Diabetes.

483
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,340
- He's worse off than you.
- That's life!

484
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,900
You'll get it too if you go on
eating, smoking, drinking...

485
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,980
They're vices.
I can't give them up.

486
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,740
- You're mad! Relax this leg.
- All right, but don't hurt me!

487
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,140
You hurt me!

488
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,660
You make me break out in a sweat
every time I give you a shot!

489
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,660
You didn't even feel the needle!

490
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,220
I have a very light hand!

491
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,860
The Commendatore, the diabetic,
says he only has his shots from me.

492
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
- He's in love with you!
- What do I care?

493
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,940
As long as he has his injections.
There you are, as good as new!

494
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,580
Rub the spot yourself.
I need to make that phone call.

495
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,140
- Go on, then!
- Thanks.

496
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,220
If you don't mind,
I'll move the phone over there.

497
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,100
All this stuff is open.
I don't want to spill anything!

498
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
- Come in!
- Are you expecting company?

499
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,860
It's my breakfast.

500
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,860
- Lord! You're having four eggs?
- I have to keep my strength up!

501
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,300
Your liver must be bombproof!

502
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,020
- What's she got to complain about?
- Who knows!

503
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,140
- Do you want an injection as well?
- No, I don't need one, do I?

504
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,620
- You do! You do!
- I don't need any injections.

505
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,060
You do! Can't you see how fat
you are? I'll help you slim down!

506
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,260
- She's huge! Where did you find her?
- Who knows?

507
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Hello! Mrs. Gisella?

508
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,620
Listen, this is Mrs. Cecconi.

509
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,580
Would you do me a favour?

510
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,620
Thanks. My little girl
is in the courtyard.

511
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,020
Would you please tell her...
No, don't bother to go down.

512
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,500
Call down from your balcony
and tell her

513
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,660
that I'm not coming and
she is to carry on with her lesson.

514
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,700
What do you mean, what lesson?
Acting! She's with her teacher.

515
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,220
Right! And tell her we'll collect
those things tomorrow.

516
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,260
We've even crossed paths
with a black cat!

517
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,900
Has he died by any chance?

518
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,340
- Who is it?
- Oh, you've answered at last!

519
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,380
- It's me, Mrs. Cecconi!
- Oh, right! Sorry!

520
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,700
She's locked herself in.

521
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,300
- Do come in!
- Another black cat!

522
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,260
- Don't be afraid. Come in.
- No. How is the attorney?

523
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,580
- Oh Lord, another one!
- Well, actually...

524
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,220
He's not well.

525
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
He has a fever again.

526
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,580
The doctor says he has
to go back to taking

527
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,260
the streptomycin every 12 hours.

528
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,860
And not to stop
even if his fever goes down!

529
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,940
- Of course he shouldn't!
- This was to be your last visit.

530
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,620
But you'll have to come back,
my dear.

531
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,940
- Thank goodness for that!
- What do you mean?

532
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,740
No, I meant for him, poor man!

533
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,060
I'll be right there. Just a moment.

534
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,780
I'll get my syringe and go through.

535
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
- Quietly, please.
- I'll walk on tip toe!

536
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,420
How could I do otherwise?
He's unwell, fortunately!

537
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,380
In five days, I'll pay for her dress.
Thank you, St. Joseph!

538
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,220
You're so kind to me!
I'll light a candle to you, later.

539
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,300
Eleonora!

540
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,500
What are you up to? We've been
waiting for you for an hour!

541
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,140
- Just a moment! Here I am!
- Don't keep the lady waiting!

542
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,780
This is all the tulle I've found!

543
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,180
But the storerooms are full of it!
You're making me look bad!

544
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,860
- That's all there is!
- Nonsense!

545
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,300
Look, Madam.

546
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,100
- Do you like it, Madam?
- Lovely! Just like a cloud!

547
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,300
- Let me feel it, Miss!
- Here!

548
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,060
A little hard, isn't it?

549
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
It's a pre-war fabric.
I'll sell it to you cheap.

550
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,260
- This is better.
- At cost price!

551
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,540
- This is nice and soft.
- You see?

552
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,740
This is the pattern
with a fluffy tulle skirt!

553
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,140
It's a classical tutu with
a sleeveless satin bodice.

554
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
- I see.
- Have you seen "The Red Shoes"?

555
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I'll make it identical to that one.
Don't worry! You'll love it!

556
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,780
How pretty you'll look!
Here! Do you like it?

557
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
It's the price that worries me.

558
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,740
Don't worry! I'll ask a fair price!

559
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,540
Since I'm a little short after
all I've had to spend on her,

560
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,820
at times, you never know,
one can think that...

561
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,260
I'm a nurse,
should you ever need shots!

562
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,220
Dear lady, are you joking?

563
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,540
If there's one thing I enjoy,
it's really good health!

564
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,020
You don't have shots
only when you're at death's door!

565
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,620
You have them when you're well,
as a tonic, to give you a boost!

566
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,620
- Are you here to bring me bad luck?
- You've misunderstood.

567
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,060
Maybe at home you've a relative
who needs a course of treatment.

568
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,940
What? I'm fine as I am
without you making holes in me.

569
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,100
And my family too. Right, girls?
Tell her we're bursting with health!

570
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,060
You can't get round me, you know?
Come here, dear. I'll measure you.

571
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,820
Come on!

572
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,300
She's cute!
She's about my daughter's age.

573
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,540
- Yes, she's very young.
- Right!

574
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,740
Oh, goodness!

575
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Excuse me, but must she always
stay so close to the wall?

576
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,940
She'll hurt herself like that!

577
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,300
Don't worry! She won't hurt herself!
It takes time.

578
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,980
We're in a hurry! Why doesn't she
put her with the others?

579
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,100
Aren't I right?

580
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,380
Always stuck to the wall?

581
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,940
Excuse me, does my daughter always
have to stay stuck to the wall?

582
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,620
It's been three hours.
Put her with the others!

583
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,660
But they've been studying
for two or three years.

584
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,260
You marched in here saying:
"Make her dance like a butterfly".

585
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,700
Where's your common sense?
You're asking for a lot!

586
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,340
That child is very small!
She isn't old enough for ballet!

587
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
- How old does she need to be?
- Eight!

588
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,620
Am I supposed to wait three years?

589
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,260
Do as you think best!
Anyway, her little legs...

590
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,860
Her legs? Look at them closely!
Her legs are as straight as a dart!

591
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,420
Straight legs are not enough!
You need other things.

592
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,180
You need intelligence. You dance
with your brain, not your feet!

593
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,340
What?

594
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,020
You dance with your brain,
not your feet!

595
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,420
She has a good brain. She was born
healthy, she wasn't born backward!

596
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,620
That's your opinion!
You're getting on my nerves!

597
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,540
We're the teachers! We decide
if a child is intelligent or not.

598
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,940
I decide because I'm her mother!

599
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,540
I assure you
my daughter is not stupid!

600
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:55,220
Sweetheart,
why are you crying like that?

601
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,580
They're not going to hurt you.
You too will become a good dancer.

602
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,340
Look at that girl!
How good she is!

603
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,500
Look! Can you see her?
Do you want to become like them?

604
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,420
You'll learn to be good too!

605
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,820
Did you have to make her cry?
How rude you are!

606
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,700
We're going home now.
Give Mummy a nice smile!

607
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,100
Don't let Daddy see you crying!
Let's go home! Come on!

608
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,740
Naturally, the child is rather
disheartened now,

609
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,580
but I must make it clear that
here, we study, study, study.

610
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,900
I've been dancing for 40 years,
but if I didn't practice daily,

611
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,420
these arabesques,
these temps levés...

612
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,620
You see these steps?
I couldn't do them!

613
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,500
You tell her, Placida!

614
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,660
Unfortunately, it's the truth,
you have to study

615
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,660
and sweat, sweat, sweat!

616
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,820
That's the way it is!

617
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,780
Hello, Spartaco.

618
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,300
Now you go out after dinner?
And you take the child with you?

619
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,660
What could I do? You weren't here.
Was I to leave her on her own?

620
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,020
- Where have you been?
- Giving injections.

621
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,060
- Say hello to Daddy, won't you?
- Hello, Daddy.

622
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,980
Daddy's little darling!
Give Daddy a kiss!

623
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,580
- Maddalena!
- Yes?

624
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,180
The instalments aren't
60,000 lire, but 65,000.

625
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,740
How come?

626
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,500
The lift has to be paid for.
We didn't include it.

627
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,820
Everyone's paid for it,
and so will we.

628
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
What happened to you, poppet?

629
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,900
- Tell Daddy what happened.
- I'm tired.

630
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,700
Daddy's little sweetheart!

631
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,660
This is the new house
that Daddy has bought you.

632
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,300
We're putting your bed here.

633
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
And Daddy will buy you a Pinocchio.

634
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,980
Do you know the story of Pinocchio?

635
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,940
The boy whose nose grew longer
because of all the lies he told.

636
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,860
He lied to his father,
an old man who...

637
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,980
There's only 60,000 lire here.

638
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,420
I don't have another cent.

639
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,900
How will we manage?

640
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,220
Spartaco, do we absolutely have
to pay the instalment on Monday?

641
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,820
Yes, on Monday.
We're only 5,000 short.

642
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,580
You'll just have to ask
for some arrears!

643
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,220
Didn't you feed the little one?

644
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,580
So now I'm starving her!
That's all we need!

645
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,660
She had a cup of coffee and milk
and two buns. Tell him!

646
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,020
- That wasn't much!
- Tell him!

647
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,700
- Leave it!
- Mummy will undress you.

648
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,860
- I'll do it!
- You'll tear her dress!

649
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,340
There! You undress her.

650
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,580
Daddy will put you to bed.

651
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,980
Tomorrow, I'll take her out
and buy her a big ice cream.

652
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,340
Ice cream's bad for her tummy.

653
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,420
- Maddalena, go away!
- You know I do whatever you say.

654
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,780
See how tired the child seems!
Look!

655
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,740
What do you want from me?

656
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,620
How pretty you are.
The baby of the family!

657
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,140
Do you love your Daddy?
Give me a kiss and a pinch.

658
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Tomorrow Daddy's taking you
for an ice cream all the same.

659
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,820
Are you happy?

660
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,260
- So, are you coming?
- I have a lesson tomorrow!

661
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,020
No, you're coming with Daddy.
No lessons!

662
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,700
Give Daddy a kiss.

663
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,100
Be good! Go to sleep now.
I'm turning off the light.

664
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:54,180
You see? It's Montgomery Clift.
He's nice, isn't he?

665
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:02,100
Maddalena,
forget about the cinema!

666
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,580
Spartaco, you don't understand me!

667
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,980
Look what lovely places!

668
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,620
Look where we're living.

669
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,700
When I see those things, I...

670
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,300
- Maddalena, it's all make-believe.
- It's not make-believe!

671
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,260
Oh! Look!
They're taking the wagon across!

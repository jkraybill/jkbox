1
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,440
You're very excited. What's up?

2
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,290
Oh, nothing.

3
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:56,602
Linda.

4
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,203
I'm calling you.

5
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:53,803
After that,
everything gets dark around me...

6
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,043
and she moans and embraces me.

7
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:02,054
Then I suddenly awake
with a start.

8
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:07,324
Every night I have this dream.
It's always the same.

9
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:13,604
And yet, I've never seen the woman
or the place where it happens.

10
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:17,245
It's always the same place.

11
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:21,115
I see it clearly,
as if I'd been there before.

12
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:26,406
Every time...
every time I get scared.

13
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:32,066
The strange thing is
that the dream arouses me.

14
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:36,547
More than once
I've reached orgasm.

15
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:43,427
Last night,
Omar and I went to a nightclub.

16
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,228
There was a woman performing.

17
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:51,028
I can't tell you
how shocked I was when I saw her.

18
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:55,739
It was her.
There's no doubt about it.

19
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:59,679
It was the woman
who appears in my dreams.

20
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:03,539
My dear Linda...

21
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,780
you mustn't think
your problem is unique.

22
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,530
Many women are
sexually frustrated.

23
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:16,481
Let me tell you the best cure.

24
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,271
Find yourself a lover...

25
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,501
a better lover.

26
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,035
Sorry it took so long.

27
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:01,045
Did you see Dr. Steiner?
What did he say?

28
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:04,985
Nothing much.
At least, nothing important.

29
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:37,198
I'm scared, Omar.

30
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:40,348
Let's spend the next few days
together.

31
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,700
Hello.

32
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,960
This is from the boss.
It's urgent.

33
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,601
Mr. Simpson
says it's confidential.

34
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,211
He feels our office should establish
a higher profile in Turkey.

35
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:19,562
I'm going to Anatolia to see
Countess Carody about an inheritance.

36
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:09,297
Linda.

37
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:32,639
Hello. I'm Linda Westinghouse.

38
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,939
You are to take me
to the Kadidados Islands.

39
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,349
We knew you were coming,
but you're too late.

40
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,750
The boat has already left.

41
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,990
Is there anywhere to stay?

42
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,740
Countess Carody has booked
a room for you here.

43
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:52,901
Have you come all the way
from Istanbul to see her?

44
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,381
Show the lady
to her room, Memmet.

45
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,732
It's on the first floor.

46
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:29,804
- I gave you the best room.
- Thanks.

47
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:34,964
It's nice and clean.
I got it ready for you myself.

48
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:37,545
See you tomorrow. Thanks.

49
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,875
- Call me if you need anything.
- That's very kind of you.

50
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,303
I'm sorry.

51
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:03,943
Please...

52
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,263
I didn't mean to scare you...

53
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,984
but you must not go
to the island.

54
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:15,664
- Why not?
- Death lives there.

55
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,804
Madness and death
rule the island.

56
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:24,445
Come to the wine cellar later.

57
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,415
Wait!

58
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:59,039
Is anyone home?

59
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,164
Hello.

60
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,185
Please, come here.

61
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:11,996
I'm from Simpson & Simpson.

62
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,656
- Are you Countess Carody?
- Yes.

63
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,067
- You are Miss Westinghouse.
- Yes.

64
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:22,347
- I was told you were coming.
- You have a nice view.

65
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:27,297
This is my favourite spot.
I love the isolation.

66
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,988
It's strange. I have the feeling...

67
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:35,338
I've been here before,
and that I know you.

68
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:39,768
I have the same feeling.
It happens quite a lot.

69
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,079
You must be tired.

70
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:46,249
Would you like a swim
before we get down to business?

71
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,849
Yes, that would be nice.

72
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,580
Let's go together.

73
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,360
Come on.

74
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:01,431
I didn't bring my swimsuit.

75
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:03,981
There's no need to be shy.

76
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:07,811
Don't worry.
Nobody can see us here.

77
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:16,432
Come on in,
the water's wonderful.

78
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,630
It's been a long time
since I sunbathed.

79
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,890
It's fun to be naked in the sand.

80
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,430
- Especially with another person.
- Yes.

81
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,691
You look delightful
in that suit.

82
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:04,052
Take a seat.

83
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:20,893
Your inheritance is unusual,
Countess.

84
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:24,094
I've never seen a will
like this one.

85
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:25,894
I can believe that.

86
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:30,364
It wasn't easy to transfer
the property to you.

87
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:34,105
- It always belonged to the Draculas.
- I know.

88
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:39,015
Could you tell me more
about Count Dracula and his family?

89
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:52,766
They came from Hungary, like me.

90
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:02,677
In his will,
he left everything to me...

91
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:09,228
to the woman
who made his life worth living.

92
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:13,178
Unfortunately, not everybody
is so generous.

93
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,779
It is wonderful
how much he had to give me.

94
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,050
One day I will pass it on
to someone who deserves it.

95
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,830
Maybe I can be of assistance?

96
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,171
Yes, that's quite possible.

97
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,481
Perhaps even sooner
than you think.

98
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:40,477
I love this red wine.

99
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:49,507
- What's the matter?
- I have a terrible headache.

100
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:56,458
Why don't you lie down?

101
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:59,908
I'll show you the room.
Nobody will disturb you.

102
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:03,369
Thank you. Please excuse me.

103
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,969
I don't usually drink wine.

104
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:55,414
Morpho!

105
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,475
Nadine?

106
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:12,924
Agra!

107
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:17,444
Pull yourself together.
Do you hear me?

108
00:34:19,915 --> 00:34:22,915
There, that's better. Calm down.

109
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:26,005
She's coming back. I knew it.

110
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:30,416
She will take hold of me again.
I'm so happy.

111
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,496
I sense her closeness.

112
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:39,197
Help me, so she won't
leave me again.

113
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,977
Yes, I'll make sure of it.

114
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:56,118
The moon will be red as blood...

115
00:34:56,198 --> 00:35:01,228
and the undead will step
from the dark...

116
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:05,209
Looking for victims,
ruthless and cruel.

117
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:09,339
Dr. Seward, could you come?
Agra had another fit.

118
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,080
The symptoms are always
the same.

119
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:25,141
We'd better give her
an injection.

120
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:42,322
Agra, how are you feeling?

121
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,603
Do you feel any better?

122
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:53,943
- You were hallucinating again.
- Yes.

123
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:58,784
- Was she here again?
- Yes.

124
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:05,335
I lost myself completely in her.

125
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:08,495
She was me, and I was her.

126
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:11,175
What is her name?

127
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:14,515
Don't you want to tell me?

128
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:19,426
Tell me. Who is she?

129
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:24,356
My friend is
the Queen of the Night.

130
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:26,267
I see.

131
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,390
Who are you?

132
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,560
Tell me where I am.

133
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,370
Listen to me.

134
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,830
I want to know
what it all means.

135
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,141
Wait!

136
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,141
Don't go!

137
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:21,812
Good morning.

138
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:26,752
I'm glad you are with us again.

139
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,633
How are you?

140
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:33,473
I see you're feeling better
than yesterday.

141
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,243
What's going on? Who are you?

142
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,143
Where am I?

143
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:45,954
I am Dr. Seward.
You are in my private clinic.

144
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,624
The man you saw is my assistant.

145
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,395
May I know your name?

146
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:00,705
I don't remember.

147
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:04,876
You're a foreigner, aren't you?

148
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:09,456
I don't know.

149
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:12,156
What happened?

150
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,967
I don't know.

151
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:19,997
I don't remember anything.

152
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,549
- Yes?
- Can I speak to Dr. Seward?

153
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:44,419
Please, take a seat.

154
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,520
- What can I do for you?
- I saw your ad.

155
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,570
- What's it got to do with you?
- A girl was found on the beach.

156
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,741
- I think she's my girlfriend.
- What's her name?

157
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:05,151
Linda Westinghouse.
She works for Simpson & Simpson.

158
00:39:06,392 --> 00:39:08,952
Why do you think
it's your girlfriend?

159
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:12,632
- She disappeared.
- What do you mean?

160
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:16,222
She left her hotel
without a word...

161
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:18,463
and didn't return.

162
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:22,563
Did you have an argument?

163
00:39:22,773 --> 00:39:26,343
I'm sorry, but I have to ask.

164
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:29,164
If it is her...

165
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:31,654
she's suffering
from severe shock.

166
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:36,224
But now she's a little better.
You can go and see her.

167
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:39,705
Come with me.

168
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,329
It was terrible, Omar.

169
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:26,969
I don't remember
what happened on the island.

170
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:30,299
My memory is blank.

171
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,410
I only remember
that I was alone on a boat.

172
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,180
Around me was only the sea.

173
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,030
And then there's nothing.

174
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,611
All I can see is a woman...

175
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:49,401
a naked woman
lying dead in a pool.

176
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,951
It was Countess Carody.

177
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,392
Omar, is it possible
that it was no more than a dream?

178
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:08,803
Don't think about it.

179
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,213
You must try to forget it.

180
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:15,773
We should take a vacation.

181
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:20,114
I'll try to get time off work.

182
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:23,494
Thanks, Omar. You're very sweet.

183
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,996
It was my parents' house.

184
00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:53,677
Was it a hundred
or two hundred years ago?

185
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,857
I was very young and all alone.

186
00:41:57,718 --> 00:42:02,208
From my window
I saw soldiers looting...

187
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:05,728
and raping the women
in the street.

188
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:09,238
They forced their way in
and grabbed me.

189
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,509
I struggled desperately
and cried in agony.

190
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:17,199
Suddenly the Count appeared...

191
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:19,909
Count Dracula.

192
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,350
He stuck his knife
into the soldier lying on top of me.

193
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,320
The man screamed...

194
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,330
and I felt his blood
running down my body.

195
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:35,131
He was the first man in my life.
It was horrible.

196
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:39,871
I thought I was going
to lose my mind.

197
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:44,032
I noticed the Count
leaning over me.

198
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:46,822
He whispered...

199
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:50,092
I will take
all your suffering away.

200
00:42:50,172 --> 00:42:52,872
When I woke up,
he was lying next to me.

201
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:56,773
His body was cold,
but his lips burned like fire.

202
00:42:56,843 --> 00:43:01,073
Night after night,
he came and took my blood...

203
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:04,113
to replenish his life.

204
00:43:05,154 --> 00:43:07,624
When he realised...

205
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:12,394
that I was losing my strength...

206
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:19,085
he shared with me
the secrets of the vampires.

207
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:25,056
Why did he do it?

208
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:34,896
He was addicted to my body.

209
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,807
It was he who initiated me.

210
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:40,677
Men still disgust me.
I hate them all.

211
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:45,637
Many were captivated by me.
Many women.

212
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:52,388
I bewitched them.
They lost their identity.

213
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,948
I became them.

214
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:59,099
But then I met Linda.

215
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:05,209
Now I'm under her spell.

216
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:08,069
I have to...

217
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,750
initiate her into our circle.

218
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:55,656
I was waiting for you.

219
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:12,543
This is blood.

220
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:17,624
Did you realise it was blood?

221
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:44,386
You are one of us now.

222
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:48,467
The Queen of the Night
will bear you up...

223
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,467
on her black wings.

224
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:57,728
Kovec nihe trekatsch.

225
00:50:58,618 --> 00:51:01,458
Kovec nihe trekatsch.

226
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,059
Save me.

227
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,068
Nadine!

228
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:03,869
He's lost a lot of blood,
but it's not serious.

229
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:22,051
Maybe what happened to him
is my fault.

230
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:24,851
You are a charming girl...

231
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:29,851
but you haven't got
the slightest idea about occultism.

232
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:33,762
You can't influence
the supernatural.

233
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:39,862
You should have seen how pale he was,
and he had marks on his neck!

234
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:44,213
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but Agra's having an attack.

235
00:53:44,283 --> 00:53:47,583
- Could you come over?
- Right away.

236
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:51,714
I've spent a lot of time
studying vampires.

237
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,844
Would you like to come with me?

238
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:06,775
I know who can get in touch
with these forces, and who can't.

239
00:54:08,656 --> 00:54:13,096
Your friend will never
cross over to their world.

240
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:18,436
That's why he won't fall victim
to these forces.

241
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:23,427
With you, Linda, it's different.

242
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:27,567
- You are in danger.
- I thought as much.

243
00:54:37,328 --> 00:54:43,428
I find myself in strange situations
and do inexplicable things.

244
00:54:43,509 --> 00:54:46,379
It's like a call from nowhere.

245
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:50,199
You have been chosen
by the Spirits of the Night.

246
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:53,519
I'm frightened of these powers...

247
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,150
and yet I have to study
the phenomenon.

248
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:03,260
I'm one of the few people
who know how to protect themselves.

249
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:06,371
I will let you in on my secret...

250
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:08,341
if you want me to.

251
00:55:08,411 --> 00:55:10,581
Yes, I do.

252
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:15,691
It depends on the desire to live
and to free yourself.

253
00:55:16,452 --> 00:55:21,862
If you succeed in killing a vampire,
the body will vanish into nothing.

254
00:55:25,133 --> 00:55:27,863
The brain must receive
a deadly blow.

255
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:39,553
You have to split the head
with an axe...

256
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:43,564
or pierce it with a bar.

257
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:04,596
What's the matter?

258
00:56:04,826 --> 00:56:07,526
What's up? Please, calm down.

259
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:13,627
She was inside me.

260
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:19,677
And now she's gone.

261
00:56:20,158 --> 00:56:22,498
Nobody can save me!

262
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:24,578
Why not?

263
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,688
Because she's left me.

264
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:32,639
But why can't you be saved?

265
00:56:34,279 --> 00:56:36,049
Agra!

266
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,850
You must trust me
and tell me everything.

267
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,420
No, no. It's too late,
much too late.

268
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,460
You can't help me now, Doctor.

269
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:00,571
Okay, fine.

270
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:05,912
She just told me
she's coming back.

271
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:09,162
She wants to come back to me...

272
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:13,962
because she wants to meet you.

273
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:44,645
- How are you?
- Better, thanks.

274
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:47,426
May I leave now?

275
00:57:47,486 --> 00:57:53,016
You can leave whenever you want.
You're not in danger.

276
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:55,566
I'm worried about Linda, Doctor.

277
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:01,217
She's been very strange lately.

278
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:05,537
She doesn't reply to my questions.

279
00:58:05,618 --> 00:58:08,478
It's as if she's miles away.

280
00:58:08,558 --> 00:58:14,468
When she does say something,
it's mostly incoherent.

281
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:21,479
She's better.
There's no need to worry.

282
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:27,149
But why is she growing weaker
every day?

283
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,320
She won't survive another attack.

284
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,090
I told your girlfriend
what she has to do.

285
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,560
It just depends on whether
she is strong enough to resist.

286
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:45,071
If she's is,
she'll soon be out of danger.

287
00:58:45,141 --> 00:58:47,741
- That's a promise.
- Thanks.

288
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:51,581
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

289
00:59:14,254 --> 00:59:15,514
Wait!

290
00:59:16,994 --> 00:59:18,614
Don't go!

291
00:59:19,834 --> 00:59:23,744
You must help me.
They won't let me talk to anyone.

292
00:59:24,135 --> 00:59:29,835
I escaped. They locked me up
because they think I'm crazy.

293
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:32,545
Why did they lock you up?

294
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:37,116
Because they're idiots
who don't know...

295
00:59:37,196 --> 00:59:39,226
that there are supernatural powers...

296
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:42,126
and that I'm in touch with them.

297
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:44,167
You have to...

298
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:49,037
You have to go to her house.
Do you know it?

299
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:53,277
The old house of Uskalan,
up on the mountain.

300
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,338
Tell her she's got to help me.

301
00:59:56,088 --> 00:59:58,248
She's here now.

302
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:02,748
Tell her, but be careful.

303
01:00:02,828 --> 01:00:06,388
She'll hate you
because you're a man.

304
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:10,839
Go on, lock her up!

305
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:17,739
Did you escape again?
That was the last time, I swear.

306
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,690
Get out!
I don't want to see you here again.

307
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,360
Leave!

308
01:00:45,202 --> 01:00:48,502
- Where is Miss Westinghouse?
- She left.

309
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:51,843
- When?
- She checked out yesterday.

310
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:55,273
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

311
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:22,474
The more I study
the phenomenon of vampires...

312
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:26,505
the more I'm drawn to their world.

313
01:08:26,575 --> 01:08:30,015
Its powers stem
from unknown depths...

314
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:34,176
powers that are
inaccessible to most of us.

315
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:37,626
I can barely resist the temptation...

316
01:08:37,966 --> 01:08:44,746
to cross over into the dark world
of the supernatural.

317
01:08:46,577 --> 01:08:50,307
- I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor.
- What is it?

318
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:53,908
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thanks.

319
01:08:53,988 --> 01:08:58,788
- I'm finished now.
- Agra is calmer. She's sleeping.

320
01:08:58,858 --> 01:09:01,728
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

321
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:12,975
Who are you?

322
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:16,575
You know, so why ask?

323
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:22,226
I've been waiting to meet you.

324
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:26,006
But why? What do you want?

325
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:29,236
I want to enter your world.

326
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:32,107
Only with your help
can I enter this world...

327
01:10:32,177 --> 01:10:35,587
and contact the supernatural.

328
01:10:36,547 --> 01:10:39,177
You want to take Linda from me.

329
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:42,958
That's why I won't aid you.

330
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:47,918
I wanted you to come to me.

331
01:10:48,028 --> 01:10:50,188
What do you want from me?

332
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:55,869
I want to be one of you.
Help me to fulfill my wish.

333
01:10:55,939 --> 01:10:59,169
- Kovec nihe trekatsch.
- Shut up!

334
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,450
Our words have no power
when you say them.

335
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,530
He who is our enemy
will lose the battle...

336
01:11:11,131 --> 01:11:13,661
and will never join our empire.

337
01:11:14,511 --> 01:11:16,571
Why did you come here?

338
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:20,181
Because this is the hour of your death.

339
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:22,481
You will never succeed!

340
01:11:22,552 --> 01:11:25,382
Sanctus spiritus benedictus...

341
01:11:26,422 --> 01:11:29,182
aberatio aberni mandati nolet.

342
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:32,322
Morpho!

343
01:13:31,184 --> 01:13:34,174
I've come to say goodbye.

344
01:13:34,254 --> 01:13:37,054
I have to leave you forever.

345
01:14:28,309 --> 01:14:32,749
The famous scientist Aldon Seward
was killed last night.

346
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:37,809
Two people dressed in black
were seen leaving the scene.

347
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,250
Oh, it's you.

348
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:44,390
How's your girlfriend?

349
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,620
- Did you see this?
- Yes.

350
01:14:48,441 --> 01:14:52,641
They killed the charlatan
who studied vampires.

351
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:57,021
- What's it to you?
- Linda has disappeared!

352
01:14:57,082 --> 01:15:00,172
She's got to be
in the hands of the killers.

353
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:03,392
Your imagination is running wild.

354
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:06,702
She's probably with another man.

355
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:08,692
There was another murder.

356
01:15:08,763 --> 01:15:12,673
A dancer killed her partner
by biting through her jugular.

357
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:16,133
This dancer will lead us to Linda.

358
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,884
I managed to find out
where she lives.

359
01:15:21,424 --> 01:15:25,094
- Where?
- In an old house in Uskalan.

360
01:15:26,964 --> 01:15:30,104
You shouldn't go on your own.
I'm coming.

361
01:15:49,696 --> 01:15:53,726
You are here to meet Dracula's heirs.

362
01:15:53,807 --> 01:15:58,447
You will be mine
in this night of darkness.

363
01:15:58,507 --> 01:16:03,947
You're beautiful when you're scared,
but even more so in death.

364
01:16:04,488 --> 01:16:08,548
Go on, scream.
Nobody will hear you.

365
01:16:08,628 --> 01:16:12,028
Since my wife left,
I've been searching.

366
01:16:12,099 --> 01:16:18,039
Her name was Agra.
She went to the woman on the island.

367
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:21,239
When she came back,
she was crazy.

368
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:24,509
The doctor locked her up.

369
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:28,120
Your death will be sweet.

370
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:30,280
You will beg me.

371
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,660
You will beg me to kill you.

372
01:16:33,731 --> 01:16:36,101
In death, you'll kiss me...

373
01:16:36,201 --> 01:16:39,401
and tell me
you can't live without me.

374
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:42,911
I want your blood.

375
01:16:42,981 --> 01:16:46,671
Your blood, your blood!
I want to hear you scream.

376
01:16:47,822 --> 01:16:53,152
I'll take the ropes off,
so you're free to feel the pain.

377
01:16:53,262 --> 01:16:57,862
- Leave me alone!
- You will beg for love, not hate.

378
01:16:57,933 --> 01:17:01,423
My hate and my love for you
are infinite.

379
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:10,894
Your blood... red as death!

380
01:17:11,754 --> 01:17:14,484
As red as...

381
01:17:15,995 --> 01:17:21,595
Your beauty...
godlike and yet so deadly.

382
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:28,975
I will inflict pain on you.
You will love me!

383
01:17:29,056 --> 01:17:34,156
I'm not the one who will hurt you.
It is your choice.

384
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:37,486
Will you obey me
like the one before you?

385
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:41,897
She was happy.
Come, you can meet her.

386
01:17:48,218 --> 01:17:52,928
She felt happiness in my arms
through my torture.

387
01:17:52,988 --> 01:17:56,218
- Her death was love.
- I love you too.

388
01:17:56,898 --> 01:17:59,628
- Yes, my little dove.
- I love you.

389
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:03,189
Yes, in agony they all love me.

390
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:07,109
It was like a game when I hanged her.

391
01:18:07,179 --> 01:18:10,479
I will play the game
by your rules.

392
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,070
It'll be like never before.

393
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:16,950
We'll both be perfect
and enjoy my pain.

394
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:21,530
I want it too!
I'll do what you want.

395
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:24,291
But you'll have to free me.

396
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:30,041
- Yes, I will.
- Do it!

397
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:36,322
It'll be nice for both of us, yes.

398
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:39,192
You are so beautiful...

399
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:46,633
Beautiful...

400
01:20:27,862 --> 01:20:29,292
Morpho!

401
01:22:32,484 --> 01:22:35,324
Nadine, open up!

402
01:22:46,105 --> 01:22:51,305
Nadine, open up!
Don't you hear? Please...

403
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:31,499
What is it? What's the matter?

404
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:36,709
The end has come... for me.

405
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:46,201
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

406
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:49,841
Only you can help me.

407
01:23:50,371 --> 01:23:54,671
Only through your blood
will my strength return.

408
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:58,612
No, I don't want to belong to you.

409
01:24:05,903 --> 01:24:07,373
You...

410
01:24:10,073 --> 01:24:13,663
You want to leave me?

411
01:24:50,737 --> 01:24:53,207
This is the end.

412
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:56,697
It has to be the end.

413
01:25:41,111 --> 01:25:45,711
No, I don't want to be like you.

414
01:25:46,152 --> 01:25:48,882
That's why I have to do it.

415
01:28:00,424 --> 01:28:03,124
Come on, Dr. Steiner.
Here she is!

416
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:30,067
I don't understand...

417
01:28:31,547 --> 01:28:35,487
I don't understand...

418
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:39,178
It was a bad dream, Linda.
Nothing more.

419
01:28:42,228 --> 01:28:45,958
No, it wasn't a dream...

420
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,299
unbelievable as it may seem.

421
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:52,409
Even if there is no explanation.

422
01:28:53,509 --> 01:28:55,569
The pain will fade in time...

423
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,990
but the memory will remain...

424
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,920
for as long as I live.

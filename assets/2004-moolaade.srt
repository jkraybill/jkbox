1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,392
Push! Push guys, harder!

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,279
Mercenaire has arrived.
Mercenaire has arrived.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,557
My greetings, ladies!

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,153
Mother Collé! Mother Collé!

5
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
God! What is it?

6
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,114
Mother, what is it?

7
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,229
Do not beat them. Look at their clothes,
they've deserted the excision.

8
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,871
Quick, call your mother Adjaratou.

9
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,071
Mother Diattou. Mother Diattou.

10
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,879
- What is it?
- My mom's asking for you.

11
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,991
What's going on?

12
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,756
- They've run away from purification.
- My god!

13
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,674
What is this early morning drum
announcing?

14
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,512
- Bathily.
- Traoré.

15
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,559
- Good morning.
- Bathily.

16
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,474
We were also wondering about the drum.

17
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,911
They are looking for something.
It sounds rather serious.

18
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,557
They are looking for human beings.

19
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,238
Not one or two people.
Six people are missing.

20
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,998
- Greetings, ladies.
- Did you have a good night?

21
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,038
- Ciré, ready?
- Yes, all set.

22
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,475
First wife, we are ready to depart.

23
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,914
- May you have a safe journey.
- Amen.

24
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,108
- May you return safely to us.
- Amen.

25
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,317
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

26
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,195
Stand up.

27
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,110
Mother Collé,
we are requesting your protection.

28
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,555
We do not wish to be cut.

29
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,077
My elder, if you grant them protection,

30
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,869
it will be said you inspired them.

31
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,033
Mother, do not deny them.

32
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,875
One cannot deny someone protection.

33
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,072
Allah willing, tomorrow,
I will make their case public.

34
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,276
Tomorrow?

35
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,035
The moolaade will have started.

36
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,715
Amsatou, have them change clothes.

37
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,316
- Follow me.
- I am going to the well.

38
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,554
Mercenaire. Mercenaire.

39
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,109
Hey, Sanata.

40
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,236
Good morning, Mercenaire!

41
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,391
Greetings, ladies!

42
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,994
Come and see my inventory.

43
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,994
Hey, Sanata, I brought beautiful things.

44
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,392
Nice clothes for the purified girls.
I also have bread.

45
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,949
Greetings, Mercenaire.

46
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,875
- Hey, Collé, good morning.
- Morning.

47
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,839
Mercenaire,
keep three kilos of bread for me.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,549
It is as if you already
have them in your belly.

49
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,798
- You do smell great, don't you?
- You naughty.

50
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,793
You are troubling for the mind.

51
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,875
Mercenaire, you are a womaniser.

52
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,629
Can I help you?
How much bread?

53
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,758
One and a half kilos.

54
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,871
A kilo...

55
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,071
and a half.

56
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,310
Patience.

57
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,638
Sweet for the kids.

58
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,431
Goodbye, fellow.

59
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,229
Thanks, sister.
Here, some sweets.

60
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,348
Next in line.

61
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,589
Woman, candies for your kids.

62
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,149
Thanks.

63
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,710
- Amsatou.
- Yes.

64
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,751
Mercenaire is in town.

65
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,313
Go buy 5kg of bread
and batteries for the radio.

66
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,596
I am on my way.

67
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,956
Oumy.

68
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,633
Awa.

69
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,199
Nafissatou.

70
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,831
Do not step out. Wait.

71
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,909
Come closer.

72
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,279
See this rope? You will only cross it
with my permission.

73
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,790
Neither can I dismiss you from the house
before the end of the moolaade.

74
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,871
This -

75
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,797
whoever breaks that law
will be killed by the moolaade.

76
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,349
- Hear me?
- We do.

77
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,589
Now, let's go back in.

78
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,037
- So, Amsatou.
- Mercenaire.

79
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,272
You don't stop growing.
Anything you desire?

80
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,113
Five kilos of bread and radio batteries.

81
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,794
Coming up. Come see.

82
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,358
Two.

83
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,278
Five kilos.

84
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,757
Let me do the wrapping.

85
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,310
- Voilá.
- Mercenaire, good morning.

86
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,233
Amsatou, do not move.
Wait.

87
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,516
Anything, beautiful?

88
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,159
A razor blade.

89
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,709
Here.

90
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,589
State of the art.

91
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,354
Very flexible.

92
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,957
- Your money.
- Please, allow me to do the giving. Here.

93
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,634
Say, could you come see me tonight?

94
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,156
God, someone is lucky.

95
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,710
You people my dreams.

96
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,270
I am out of here, you womaniser.

97
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,198
Amsatou, seen anything you like?
Like this one?

98
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,072
Look. The latest fashion,
and a perfect fit. Buy it.

99
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,798
I am penniless.

100
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,751
Not to worry, come back tonight.

101
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,357
The money I don't have now,
how can I have it tonight?

102
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,911
Amsatou, I'll ask to have you as wife.

103
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,517
Marriage?
I am already taken.

104
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,789
I'll triple your bride price.

105
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,158
My fiancé is richer than you are.
He works in Paris, France.

106
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,393
You are nothing but a mercenary.

107
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,312
Do you know that word means?

108
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,715
Mercenaries are people
who kill women, children,

109
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,235
and they also do coup d'états.

110
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,756
See, I too do listen to the radio.

111
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,435
You sure are a smart cookie.

112
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
So long,

113
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,595
Mercenaire.

114
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,233
Doucouré. Doucouré.

115
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,278
- Bathily.
- Good morning.

116
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,477
Amsatou, your future husband
should arrive soon.

117
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,829
You will hand him the welcoming water.
Look your best, and see you soon.

118
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,193
Dougoutigui.

119
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,669
Doucouré. Welcome.

120
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,638
- What can I do for you?
- We want batteries.

121
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,349
- It is for a radio?
- Indeed.

122
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,076
I have both local
and French-made batteries.

123
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,552
The French are more durable,
but they also cost more.

124
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,439
Go for the French. We want to listen
to the recital of the Koran.

125
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,593
I also have children's clothing,

126
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,278
kitchen utensils, and much more.

127
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,235
What about you, Dougoutigui?

128
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,632
I want batteries and 30 kilos of bread.

129
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,555
My son arrives soon from France,
he'll pay you.

130
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,477
- I'll send someone to pick them up.
- Very well, Dougoutigui.

131
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,711
I heard the drum this dawn.

132
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,796
- It's about the girls' purification.
- Allah be praised, a minor domestic issue.

133
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,554
This one is good.
Hand me another one.

134
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,711
Worthless.

135
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,632
Good.
Some music now, shall we?

136
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,358
Mother, the bread and the batteries.

137
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,836
Mother, Mercenaire brought
beautiful clothes.

138
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,470
They are very expensive, Amsatou.

139
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,359
It's my duty to welcome the guest.

140
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,036
I am penniless.
Wait for your father's return.

141
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,230
- What if someone buys what I want?
- What if Mercenaire had not arrived?

142
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,349
I saw beautiful things at Mercenaire's, and I
have been assigned to welcome the guest.

143
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,193
Good news.
Let's go.

144
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,113
- Collé.
- Yes.

145
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,032
We are going to Mercenaire's.

146
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,919
Her fiancé is on his way.
She is to present him the welcoming water.

147
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,110
Coming back from France.
Besides, marriage is a serious issue.

148
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,676
Why did you choose
to come to me for protection?

149
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,195
Nafi?

150
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,557
Six of us wanted to go to the city,

151
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,793
but we do not have any connection.
You are our last resort.

152
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,191
The two others went a different way.

153
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,310
You mean six of you
deserted the purification?

154
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,031
How did you get the idea?

155
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,191
Oumy?

156
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,710
We were told you refused
to have your daughter cut.

157
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,193
Now you are our only lifeline.

158
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,638
Oumy, there is too much gossip
at the well.

159
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,756
You should know that
purification is one thing,

160
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,435
and moolaade a different thing.

161
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,514
Diattou, what about you?

162
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,835
My older sister died of the purification.
That's why I don't want to get cut.

163
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,074
Awa?

164
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,710
Mother, you did not have Amsatou cut.

165
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,757
Her fiancé in France
is the son of the Dougoutigui.

166
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,631
He is bringing back a lot of money
and he is going to marry her.

167
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,756
Diattou?

168
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,070
Is it true that a bilakoro
cannot have children?

169
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,231
That is not true.

170
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,635
Collé, we went and took the things,
on credit.

171
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,712
Her fiancé will pay when he gets here.

172
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,872
When he arrives from France, he'll pay.

173
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,236
Kids, take these things inside.

174
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,350
Take all of it.

175
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,430
Go with them.

176
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,396
Collé, you've started the moolaade.

177
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,074
Are you aware of the responsibilities?

178
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,028
Elder, it is a question of life and death.

179
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,036
I won't add a word.

180
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,749
Mother, the salindana are here, mother.

181
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,994
Mother Diattou, they are on us, dear.

182
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,831
You take this.

183
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,795
Collé Ardo, seven years ago,
you refused to have your daughter purified.

184
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,512
I purified you,
along with Seynabou, Binetou,

185
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,717
Salba, Coumba and Binetou.

186
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,839
Why do you oppose
the purification of these children?

187
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,198
Truth be told,
you cut me and stitched me twice.

188
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,955
Twice,
and you also buried my two children.

189
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,190
When my Amsatou was being born,

190
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,992
the woman doctor opened me up to here
to let her out.

191
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,359
These children requested protection.
They'll get it.

192
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,353
What are you talking about?

193
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,670
Who put them under your care?

194
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,550
You want our daughters to remain
a bilakoro like your Amsatou.

195
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,869
Hey, Collé!

196
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,319
During our purification you were
the only disgraced girl to cry. You peed too.

197
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,793
Whoever crosses this rope

198
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,394
will be punished by the moolaade.

199
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,029
Oumy, Diattou, Awa, Nafi,

200
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,759
if you want to be cut
cross this rope.

201
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,232
- Diattou, Diattou come here.
- I don't want to.

202
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,233
Do come, you won't be purified.

203
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,555
Diattou, come here, bastard.
You will never get a husband.

204
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,790
Collé, it's you who manipulates them.

205
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,154
I do not wish to be cut.

206
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,312
- Me neither.
- We don't want to.

207
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,189
Collé, have you seen my child?

208
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,636
I only know of these four.

209
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,598
Mom, let's go find our children.

210
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,117
For each child you received 10,000 CFA
and imported bar soap.

211
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,590
Ardo, you are too subversive.

212
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,437
I will have to neutralise your powers.

213
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,157
Niassi, Salba, Binetou, Senebou,

214
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,914
under my protection
your children will be safe.

215
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,315
Now, let's go find the two missing children.

216
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,270
- Good morning, Mother.
- Bathily.

217
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,631
- How is the farm?
- I praise Allah.

218
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,079
Nothing serious.
The salindana did complain.

219
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,990
- Send them back the children.
- Never!

220
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,720
They have not committed any crime.

221
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,952
Mother, the salindana
will cast a spell on them.

222
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,989
Go tell your mother Collé,
the children are under her care.

223
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,278
You know she's a mad woman.

224
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,754
She manipulates them.
She refused to have Amsatou purified.

225
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,832
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

226
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,470
Thank you.

227
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,029
Didn't she refuse?

228
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,071
End of conversation.

229
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,834
- Why is she crying?
- She is not able to pee.

230
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,632
With your pinkie covered with Karite butter,
remove the clot.

231
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,715
Do not drive in your finger.

232
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,670
Take off their loincloth.

233
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,037
Quick on your feet.

234
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,795
Quick. Follow me.

235
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,631
Form a circle.

236
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,830
Spread your legs.
You have to open up.

237
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,549
Now jump. Jump. Now jump. Jump.

238
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,993
Now jump. Jump. Now jump. Jump.

239
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,832
Hand me my bag.

240
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,910
Thank you.

241
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,117
Now this has become
a contentious issue.

242
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,594
The two missing girls
escaped to the city.

243
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,597
Seven years ago,

244
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,594
Collé Ardo refused
to have her daughter purified.

245
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,632
Now she is harbouring four girls in
her house to keep them from purification.

246
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,078
She things her powers greater than ours.

247
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,391
She wants us to give up our knives.

248
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,438
Should we give in?

249
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,950
Let's request
a meeting with the Dougoutigui.

250
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,238
Collé is challenging us.

251
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,235
I will destroy her powers.

252
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,191
- Balla is rather early today.
- What was he saying about the girls?

253
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,432
What does he intend?

254
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,397
Is he about to snatch them from me?

255
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,951
My conversation with my son
is none of your business.

256
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,673
And don't you ever raise your voice when
talking to me. Be back to your quarters.

257
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,235
Welcome, all.
You the noteworthy, welcome.

258
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,878
Hail, Doucouré. Bathily.

259
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,237
You, Kémo, I salute you.

260
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,397
You dignitaries, I welcome you.

261
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,839
Women give birth to kings.

262
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,752
They give birth to the poor.

263
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,833
They also give birth to the valiant.
I salute you, women.

264
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,237
Like a man, a valiant woman
deserves to wear the pants.

265
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,757
Dougoutigui, Kémo, dignitaries.

266
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,592
The salindana wish to be heard.

267
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,911
We shall hear them.

268
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,470
Purification is a tradition
none ever questioned.

269
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,158
Seven years ago,

270
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,519
Collé Ardo had refused
to have her daughter purified.

271
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,877
- Say who?
- Collé Ardo Gallo Sy.

272
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,952
Your younger brother's second wife.

273
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,829
My brother is out of town.

274
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:16,071
I give you permission
to get the girls and to purify them.

275
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,594
Dougoutigui, may I speak?

276
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,194
You may.

277
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,797
Dean of the salindana,
did you have some girls escape?

278
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,157
We are still looking for them.

279
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,394
Haven't you heard what Amath just said?

280
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,074
His younger brother is not here.

281
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,916
He gives you permission
to get hold of the girls.

282
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,189
No one ever married a bilakoro.

283
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,828
Never, ever.

284
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,834
We cannot get hold of them.
Collé Ardo granted them the moolaade.

285
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,319
Oh, Lord!

286
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,391
Kawako!

287
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,309
Moolaade, you are in this anthill...

288
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,112
that embodies our first king,
Yérim Dethié Kodé Ndiak.

289
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:32,074
His people rebelled
and he was transformed into this anthill.

290
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,429
He had offended the moolaade.

291
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,999
Kalfa!

292
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,836
His rebellious subjects killed him.

293
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,593
After he was buried here,

294
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,038
his body was swollen and...

295
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:01,075
transformed into his anthill.

296
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,759
Years later,
our ancestors converted to Islam.

297
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,835
To Allah they erected this mosque

298
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,912
next to the tomb of the first king.

299
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,079
None can transgress the moolaade.

300
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,158
Its sprit is formidable.

301
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,356
To calm its spirit

302
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,717
one needs to shed blood.

303
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,591
Eskey. Eskey.

304
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,510
That's all I had to say.

305
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,668
Collé Ardo is challenging our traditions.

306
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:16,552
Seven years ago,
she refused to have her daughter purified.

307
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,713
Will you men then marry bilakoro women?

308
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,269
- Never!
- Hell no.

309
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,469
- Amath Bathily.
- Yes.

310
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,679
Hear this.
My son is not going to marry a bilakoro.

311
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,514
Dougoutigui, take it easy.

312
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,796
There still is a way
to purify all these girls.

313
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,951
Isn't your son arriving in two days?

314
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,157
If we purify then, including Amsatou,

315
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,633
your son will have to wait only 15 days.

316
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,318
15 days?
That's too long to keep an erection!

317
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,794
Silence, please.

318
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,555
As long as Collé Ardo
has not uttered the word,

319
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,751
no one will be able to take the girls
away from her quarters.

320
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,314
- Kémo Tiécoura.
- Yes.

321
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,631
Our ancestors offer a way out.

322
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,475
A husband has unlimited powers.

323
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,111
He may demand his wife
to utter the redemptive word.

324
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,230
This has to be done publicly
to bring an end to the moolaade.

325
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,829
Kémo Ansoumana,

326
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,753
thank you for your wisdom.

327
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,310
I understand what you are suggesting.

328
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,239
Ladies, you may leave.

329
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,517
The Dougoutigui excuses you.

330
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,878
You'll be informed of his decision.

331
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,917
Mama Collé, help!

332
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,114
Kawako, they are like
vultures that smell blood.

333
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,274
They took their case to the Dougoutigui.

334
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,876
Elder, I am scared of their curse.

335
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,350
The girls are not under your care.

336
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,270
Shut up or I'll kick your ass!

337
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,035
Do not touch her.
She has my protection.

338
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,915
You are not crazy after all.

339
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,755
She still has respect for me.

340
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,352
- Good morning, brother-in-law.
- Good morning.

341
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,271
- Bathily.
- Traoré.

342
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,954
- Bathily.
- Bah.

343
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,554
Our husband has been away
for a long time.

344
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,995
Not to worry.

345
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,517
You know how meticulous he is.

346
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,831
In his absence, Collé...

347
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,913
Hold on.
Wait for her to be here.

348
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,239
Wait here.

349
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,153
On my way.

350
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,991
Let's go in.

351
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,277
- Your co-wife has bad manners.
- Uncle is right.

352
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,954
Purification dates back long ago,

353
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:48,275
and she wants to challenge it.
No, over my dead body.

354
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,871
Elder, I do not want to be burnt
by the fire Collé has started.

355
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,191
Shut up and go back to your quarters.

356
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,355
Here he is.
He has arrived.

357
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,431
- Alima, are you ready?
- Let's go.

358
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,028
You are not coming to be welcome party?

359
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,395
Sorry, I am too busy.

360
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,876
Go in peace.

361
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,153
People, admire the valiant.

362
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,118
Admire the son of the lion.

363
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,159
Doucouré, proud heir to your ancestors.

364
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,598
Heir to the throne,
the people salute you.

365
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,751
Doucouré, Doucouré, the generous.

366
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,874
Doucouré, here is your brave son.
He arrives from France.

367
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,953
He's coming to get married.

368
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,875
Doucouré, they also hail you as Cissé,
Sylla, Touncara.

369
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,191
Doucouré, descendent of Segou.
Your origins are in nine Soninke villages.

370
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,029
Women, the heir to Alpha Doucouré
is back with us.

371
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,872
He is tall, strong,
and as handsome as the rising sun.

372
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,273
- Good morning, Mother.
- Good morning, son.

373
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,629
Thank you.

374
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,998
Folks of Djerisso.

375
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,597
Our good Dougoutigui's son
is back from France.

376
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,591
Come all and welcome him.

377
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,038
The blessed son is back from France.

378
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,635
Let us be reminded that
everything has its time and place.

379
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,151
Mother.

380
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,995
Why didn't you have me purified?

381
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,154
I would have given Ibrahima Doucouré.
The welcoming water.

382
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,755
Allah is great.

383
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,959
Feel no shame in being bilakoro.
Hear me?

384
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:11,309
Nafissatou, I am speaking for you too.

385
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,270
Your two older sisters died before birth.

386
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,515
You owe your life to your doctor namesake.

387
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,992
She tore me apart to deliver you.

388
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,357
Genital mutilation is a bad thing.
A bilakoro is a good wife,

389
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,193
a good mother.

390
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,795
Look at all these goodies. He must've
brought back all the wealth of France.

391
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,996
What a worthy man.

392
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,036
Rich.

393
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,430
- Bad, we are already old.
- I would be stalking him.

394
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,195
- Doucouré.
- Greetings.

395
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,959
- You are Aunt Khardjatou?
- Yes, I am.

396
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,270
I cannot forget you.

397
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,910
As a child,
I used to steal from your cornfield.

398
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,034
What a good memory!

399
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,638
Meet my husband's third wife.

400
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,395
- What about Auntie Collé Ardo?
- Amsatou and her mother send greetings.

401
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,394
I'll come and visit them.

402
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,471
Welcome back.

403
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,473
What's happening?

404
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,870
The two missing girls
threw themselves in the well.

405
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,429
- Ibrahima, go have a rest.
- Yes, Mom.

406
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,351
Dougoutigui,
the girls threw themselves in the well.

407
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,353
- Oh, my God.
- Allah is great.

408
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,115
Tomorrow we'll fill it in.

409
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,034
Our emissaries are back.

410
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,270
The women should not be allowed
to listen to the radio.

411
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,273
All their radios should be confiscated.

412
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,238
What to do now?

413
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,836
Amath, speak to Ciré, your brother.

414
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,270
Collé is at the roots of the moolaade
and of the two girls' suicide.

415
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,477
I do understand.

416
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,351
Ciré, welcome back.

417
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,196
Bathily, did you have a nice trip?

418
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,630
Welcome back both.

419
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,395
Ciré, in your absence,

420
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,156
Collé gave asylum to four girls in your
house to shield them from purification.

421
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,912
I witnessed it.

422
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,278
Ciré, Dougoutigui wants you to know,

423
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,592
his son cannot marry your daughter.

424
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,038
- And why?
- Because she is a bilakoro.

425
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:10,275
She has to be purified.
Collé's radio should be confiscated.

426
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,874
- Confiscate her radio?
- Absolutely.

427
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,110
Hamsatou, her daughter's namesake,
gave it to her.

428
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,431
What about your authority?

429
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:25,599
Tell Dougoutigui
we brought back good crops.

430
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,310
We are listening to you,
our children's father.

431
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,189
You may listen,
but then you do what you please.

432
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,028
How come as a first wife
you allowed Collé to keep the children?

433
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,756
You went against my authority.

434
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,434
We did not mean to.

435
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,309
If, in your absence,
I'd told Collé to give up the girls,

436
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,715
it would be said in your absence
I denied young girls a needed protection.

437
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,079
You should've expelled them.

438
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,800
Out of here!

439
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,438
- Collé.
- Yes.

440
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,636
Do come back.

441
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,153
Down to the floor.

442
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,239
Collé,

443
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,918
18 years of marriage,
only one daughter.

444
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,913
You are my favourite wife.

445
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,275
You refused to have our daughter purified.

446
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,510
I did not object.

447
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,478
Now you want all girls to remain bilakoro.

448
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,154
You have climbed over my head,
I did not object,

449
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,279
and now you want to shit on my head.

450
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,839
Collé,

451
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,958
tomorrow morning,

452
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,753
you will utter the word
that ends the moolaade.

453
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,153
Amsatou and all the other girls
shall be purified.

454
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,956
And one more thing.

455
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,953
This radio, this damned radio,

456
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,032
I no longer want to hear it in my house.

457
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,191
Hear me?

458
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,711
May I be excused?

459
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,193
The village is silent.
Like a graveyard.

460
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,272
I heard the men confiscated
all the women's radios.

461
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,352
All this was cooked up by Amath.

462
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,559
I never liked him.

463
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,838
I am really worried about Amsatou.

464
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,197
She asked me why I did not have her cut.

465
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,198
Since she learned that Doucouré's son
is not going to marry her,

466
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,750
she has been disappointed.

467
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,310
Now she hangs a lot around Mercenaire.
I do not like that guy.

468
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,914
You do not know that fellow.

469
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,471
He's worst than a goat,
always around women.

470
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,359
Womanising all the time.

471
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,559
I know a magic potion
that will reduce his craving.

472
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,269
Elder, hand some to Amsatou's father.

473
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,635
Yes, he needs it.

474
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,873
Amsatou's father has decided
to make me say the redemptive word

475
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,873
to ward off the spell.

476
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,795
Do not utter it.
It is dangerous.

477
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,349
The moolaade is unforgiving.

478
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,991
Years ago two wives died from it.

479
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,358
Keep the girls here.

480
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,910
Elder, I do not understand you.

481
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,992
You do not, do you?

482
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,436
But I am on your side.

483
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,229
I often lie to protect you.

484
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,710
You can trust me.

485
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,516
- I too do not like excision.
- You don't?

486
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,114
- No.
- Liar!

487
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,512
Why did you have your daughters cut?

488
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,035
It did it against my will.

489
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,070
I got it.
I am taken as the sacrificial lamb.

490
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,036
Elders, it's getting late.
I am going to bed.

491
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,590
- Good night.
- Amen.

492
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:55,349
The four girls will sleep in my quarters.
Keep Amsatou with you.

493
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,229
- Good night.
- Good night.

494
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,196
I don't want to!
Mercy. Mercy!

495
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,793
Please, don't!
I beg you!

496
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,114
Mother, I'll handle it.

497
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,953
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

498
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,877
Morning, elder.
Morning, Collé.

499
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,270
Ibrahima, turn off your radio.

500
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,551
The elders are blessing you
for your generosity.

501
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,438
Amen!

502
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,639
You've honoured your family.
You paid for a whole building.

503
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:04,035
You provided food during hard times.

504
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,868
- The women too send their blessings.
- Amen.

505
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:17,197
You gave them a water pump
that improved their daily lives.

506
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,676
Ibrahima, we are happy to have you back.

507
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,796
May Allah reward you.

508
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,394
Before your arrival,
things happened.

509
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,712
The elders confiscated
all the women's radios.

510
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,440
You can't turn on your TV set around here.

511
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:41,197
Its influence is even worst
than that of the radio.

512
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,876
Why deny them radios and TVs?

513
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,797
Uncle,

514
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:58,399
you can no longer silence these media.

515
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:05,839
Today, everywhere in the world

516
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,791
radio and TV are parts of life.

517
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,758
We cannot cut ourselves off
from the progress of the world.

518
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,956
Before your return,

519
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,715
two girls chose to drown themselves in
a well rather than submit to purification.

520
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,318
It's Collé who sets the women
against purification.

521
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,394
I opposed your marriage
because Amsatou is a bilakoro.

522
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,199
- Fily.
- Yes.

523
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,593
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

524
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,875
You are cousins.

525
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:56,752
Yesterday the elders blessed your union
in front of Allah, at the mosque.

526
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,357
Father,
I still do honour and respect you,

527
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,638
but my marriage is my own business.

528
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,439
Say what?
You damned son!

529
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:18,073
Kawako, I am your father!
You shall marry whom I want.

530
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,833
If you don't submit,
I disinherit you.

531
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,477
Take your TV out of here.

532
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,794
Nephew, this is not a way
to talk to one's father.

533
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,349
Fily, you are excused.

534
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,277
Mother, I am going to visit families
and deliver them their money.

535
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,796
- May Allah bless you.
- Amen.

536
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,949
- Ibrahima.
- Father?

537
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:12,113
- Go see Mercenaire and pay my debts.
- I shall.

538
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,189
I've never spoken to my father like this.

539
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,955
I bought this radio with my toil.

540
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,513
I'll take it anyway. Since when
does a woman challenge her husband?

541
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,199
- Balla.
- Father.

542
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,078
Come here.

543
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,559
- Here, this one too.
- Father, this is my radio!

544
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,872
Amsatou, you shall be purified.
Yes, it will be done,

545
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,953
and I'll deliver you to the first
who requests you for marriage.

546
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,475
Let's go!

547
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:34,196
- You like them?
- I do.

548
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,632
He is my son.
Rewarding him with his first pair.

549
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,917
- He worked well.
- Well, what do you want?

550
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,991
A kettle.

551
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,878
You should not torture bank notes like this.
Here, candies.

552
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,951
Thank you.

553
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:22,398
Put on your shoes and go show them off to
your grandma before the purification party.

554
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,835
Doucouré! Konaté.

555
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,035
Greet the Dougoutigui's son.
He returned from France.

556
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,430
- How are you?
- Fine.

557
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,559
When you grow up, you too will go
to France where money is printed.

558
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,359
- May Allah protect you.
- Amen.

559
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,151
Francenabé.
How is the return to the native land?

560
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,756
>Aimé Césaire,
Notebook of my Return to my Native Land.

561
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,798
- Exactly.
- It is going well.

562
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,829
Did you know this ostrich egg
has been up there for 150 years,

563
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,390
when this shrine to Allah was built?

564
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,878
- Collé.
- Yes.

565
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,111
- Collé.
- Yes.

566
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,036
Look at this radio.

567
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,510
It only needs batteries.

568
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,796
Pati.
Pati.

569
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,993
It must be older than my grandmother.

570
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,795
Now, be aware.

571
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:42,872
If Balla or his dad catch you with it,
I don't know you.

572
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,229
There is a grave behind the mosque.
You know what is it?

573
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,628
No.

574
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,712
It is the moolaade.

575
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,959
- I came to pay my dad's debt.
- Well!

576
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,315
Dougoutigui.

577
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,994
30 kilos of bread,
at 150 Francs per kilo.

578
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,311
Six new alkaline batteries.

579
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,470
- Here's what he owes me.
- This is cheating.

580
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,837
One kilo of dry bread
at 140 Francs per kilo.

581
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,390
In the city, fresh bread costs
135 Francs per kilo.

582
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,917
When unsold, the next day
you have it for 65-70 Francs per kilo.

583
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,913
You are cheating people.

584
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,150
What do you think?

585
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,709
I too have to pay for
transportation and conservation.

586
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,477
Besides, this dry bread
is cheaper than rice or millet.

587
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:53,033
You visited Europe, and you know what
globalisation and free market mean.

588
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,669
Will I have to tell your dad
you refused to pay his debt?

589
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,755
What a bullshitter, this guy.
You are a true mercenary.

590
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,037
New bank notes!

591
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,149
That is not all.

592
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,559
You have a bill.
Your fiancé's, that is.

593
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,993
- My fiancé?
- Yes, Amsatou Ardo Bathily.

594
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,630
She came and took goods
for your wedding.

595
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:34,874
You unloaded your junk on to this girl
and I don't have to pay.

596
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,716
Francenabé,
you'll settle that with Khardjatou.

597
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,591
Good morning.

598
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,551
Good morning.

599
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,555
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

600
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,995
- Is Auntie Khardjatou in?
- Here she is.

601
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,789
Ibrahima Doucouré, how are you?

602
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,875
- Doing fine.
- Traoré!

603
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,031
- Collé. Collé.
- Yes.

604
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,510
Bring in the chair.
A distinguished guest.

605
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,797
Doucouré. Doucouré.

606
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,393
- Sy-Doucouré.
- Have a seat.

607
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,873
Amsatou, bring your husband
the welcoming water.

608
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,072
- I heard it's very cold in France.
- Cold, with snow.

609
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:49,473
No sun, girls with their hair
down to their buttocks.

610
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,950
You are right.

611
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,472
- Amsatou.
- Coming.

612
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,950
Is it you who refused to be purified?

613
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,556
You will never have husbands.

614
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,599
Won't you marry a woman bilakoro?

615
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,955
A woman bilakoro!

616
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,788
- You do have a sharp tongue.
- We listen to the radio.

617
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,796
The radio! The elders prohibited all
the women from listening to the radio.

618
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,471
How come?

619
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,192
- Thank you.
- You welcome.

620
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,513
Amsatou. Come back.

621
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:00,718
- The youngest, what's your name?
- Diattou Coulibaly.

622
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:13,392
Some candies to share.
But don't let them cheat you. Candies.

623
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,710
<i>Merci.</i>

624
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,358
Ibrahima.

625
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,556
You are about to steal our girl.

626
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,314
- Aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

627
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:33,590
Since marriage is such a serious matter,
we visited Mercenaire,

628
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,548
took things for credit,
with the promise you will pay.

629
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,271
- I hope I did the right thing.
- You sure did. I'll pay.

630
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,433
- I have to leave now.
- Doucouré.

631
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,909
- Greetings to your parents.
- Thank you.

632
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,791
- Traoré.
- So long.

633
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:01,512
- Ibrahima, do not forget to see Mercenaire.
- No, I won't.

634
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:36,113
- Our radios, we want our radios.
- Out of here. Go back home.

635
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,077
Fast.

636
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,595
You bastard.

637
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,197
- Sanata. Sanata.
- Yes.

638
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:15,796
Since you hang a lot around men, do you
know why they confiscate our radios?

639
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,509
Our men want to lock up our minds.

640
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:24,834
But how do you lock up
something invisible?

641
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,358
We are all ignorant.
I am telling you.

642
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,715
Binetou, let's go.

643
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:17,157
Ah! Without my radio
I can no longer sleep.

644
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,833
Me neither.

645
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,950
Without these programmes,
no more sleep.

646
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,392
Sisters, my sisters,

647
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,109
why this vigil at this well?

648
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,273
We bought these radios, didn't we?

649
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,232
Who should dictate what we listen to?

650
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,919
- Let's have a shower.
- Are you sleepy?

651
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:19,552
I am outraged.
It's intolerable.

652
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,434
- Hi, Francenabé.
- Mercenaire.

653
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,955
Came to pay your bills?

654
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,678
Yes.

655
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,719
I told you,
Khardjatou is a bully.

656
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,999
So, let's see for Amsatou.

657
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:05,551
Here, what you owe me.

658
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,951
All this?
This is perverse!

659
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:13,639
Your junk is not worth even half of this!

660
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,395
Francenabé, watch out.
I could tell Khardjatou.

661
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,199
Don't let it annoy you.

662
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:25,434
Here, a rubber, your first wedding present.
From me.

663
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,591
Thanks.

664
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,276
New bank notes!

665
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,915
It is expensive to have a wedding.

666
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:43,598
I know you are loaded.
You can be a friend.

667
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,955
Listen, I would like
to help with your marriage.

668
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,634
My marriage to Hamsatou won't happen.

669
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,590
My father is opposing it on
the ground that she is a bilakoro.

670
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:03,312
From a nearby village he summoned
my uncle and Fily, his daughter.

671
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,029
The elders celebrated and blessed
the marriage at the mosque.

672
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:13,476
- He doesn't know you already laid her.
- I didn't, she's eleven.

673
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:19,431
- No shit, eleven!
- Yes, but purified.

674
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:25,550
Francenabé, Fily is still being breast-fed!

675
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,518
You, your father,
and your uncle are paedophiles.

676
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,355
Did you say paedophiles?
Fuck you!

677
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,594
Now, let's talk about you.
Why were you kicked out of the military?

678
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,837
That's ancient history.

679
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,677
I participated in many UN military's peace
expeditions in the Middle East and Africa.

680
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,389
At a point,
we, the junior officers,

681
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:57,192
noticed that the senior officers
were stealing from our earnings.

682
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,591
I became our spokesman.

683
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,594
We made so much noise that
they hurriedly returned our money.

684
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,513
But it was not to end there.

685
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,911
I was especially targeted.

686
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,640
Five years in the jug,

687
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,076
and dishonourable discharge.

688
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:21,593
In the media I was nicknamed Mercenaire!

689
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,037
It suits you well.

690
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,749
Let's come back to you.
I have to speak to your father.

691
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,117
No, I can speak for myself.

692
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:39,914
You shitty little fellow, your dad and uncle
should be jailed for being paedophiles.

693
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,948
Africa is a real bitch!

694
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,554
Good morning, brother-in-law.

695
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,835
Balla! Come here.

696
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,434
- Collé!
- Yes.

697
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,671
You sit here.

698
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,910
I wouldn't have married you
if you were a bilakoro. Never!

699
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:47,360
We do not need to have a witness
to have this kind of conversation.

700
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,360
Younger brother,
your wife just kicked me out.

701
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,195
Not so fast. Calm down.

702
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,358
Sit down, older brother.

703
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:10,469
Collé, have you gone mad? How dare
you expel my elder from my house?

704
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:17,510
Young brother, have you given up
your authority as a husband?

705
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,677
Purification dates way back.

706
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,116
It is required by Islam,

707
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,635
and you woman want
to put an end to it.

708
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,950
Why are you dishonouring us?

709
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,711
Why are you opposing purification?

710
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,832
Amsatou is going to be purified.

711
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,433
- Mother.
- Yes.

712
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,272
You have visitors.

713
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,836
Father, the salindana want
to speak to my mother.

714
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,911
You may go.

715
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,035
Young brother,

716
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:14,115
Collé is holding you up to ridicule.

717
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,471
To put an end to it,
I had you take Alima as a third wife.

718
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,553
A very docile girl.

719
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:30,034
You have become
the laughing stock of the village.

720
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,638
To restore your authority,

721
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,511
you have to repudiate Collé,
kick out the four girls,

722
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:44,912
and have Amsatou purified.

723
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,916
Take this!

724
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:02,349
You have to flog her to have her utter
the word that exorcises the moolaade.

725
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,354
Here. Take it.

726
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,675
I have never beaten a woman before.

727
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,434
- Not even my daughter.
- Say what?

728
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,912
On your feet.
I am your elder.

729
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,711
Do as I say!

730
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:47,476
Mah, take care of the kids.
The moolaade is still in effect.

731
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,551
Alima, follow me.

732
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,318
Collé Ardo,
there is still time to purify the girls.

733
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:20,358
You only need to say the word.

734
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,431
- Collé.
- Yes.

735
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,235
Utter the word!

736
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,791
- My Amsatou's father...
- Say the word!

737
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,439
Say it!

738
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,434
Say it! Say it! Say it!

739
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,192
Utter the word!

740
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,113
Say it! Say it! Say it!

741
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,799
Tame her! Tame her! Harder!

742
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,989
Collé, the word.
The word!

743
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,233
Collé, say it! Say it!

744
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:39,869
Do not say it. Do not utter it.
Do not. Resist, Collé!

745
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:54,320
Collé, what are you waiting for?
Collé, what are you waiting for?

746
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,756
No shit, say it!
Say it, damn it!

747
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:10,956
Tame her. Break her.

748
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:18,911
Say nothing. Nothing.

749
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,152
Do not fall. Do not fall!

750
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,517
Why are you meddling with this?
She is his wife!

751
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,679
Kémo Amsoumana,
she did not say the word.

752
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,398
She did not say it.

753
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:09,997
After all this beating,
not a word!

754
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,594
- Unprecedented.
- That's the end of it.

755
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,753
The kalfa is with Mercenaire.

756
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:20,833
- What a failure.
- A real blow.

757
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:51,558
Tell me,
have you ever laid a bilakoro?

758
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,029
Allah forbid.

759
01:32:54,200 --> 01:33:00,389
Kémo Tiécoura, I have never done that.
Never!

760
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:07,079
- What about you?
- That's blasphemy!

761
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,390
I'll never do that!

762
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,631
Mercenaire!

763
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:21,792
What have you just done?
Stop a husband from beating his wife?

764
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:27,034
- Who do you think you are?
- I cannot bear the violence!

765
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,514
Motherfucker, you are perverting
our wives and daughters.

766
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:37,753
Get hold of this motherfucker.

767
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,438
Once out of the village,
make him disappear!

768
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,512
Hurry up! Quick!

769
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,758
- Elder, it hurts!
- Be strong.

770
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,554
I regret having my girls cut.

771
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:51,190
Allah is my witness,
no other girl will ever be cut.

772
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,069
Alima, I swear!

773
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,877
- Easy, I am in pain!
- Don't move.

774
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,510
I felt the blows in my flesh.

775
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:10,595
Amath orchestrated it all
to publicly humiliate Collé.

776
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,912
I hate that man!

777
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,197
Where are my girls?

778
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,832
During your flogging,
Salba stole Diattou.

779
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,596
She had her cut and she died from it.

780
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,790
My poor Diattou.
May Allah protect her!

781
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,678
Mercenaire has also been murdered.

782
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,072
- What?
- Yes, and all his money was stolen.

783
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,309
Poor fellow!

784
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,868
Don't cover your wounds.

785
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:19,110
Elder, the moolaade has ended.

786
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:29,348
Alima, go undo the symbol.

787
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,397
Right away.

788
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,631
Greetings.

789
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,708
- Mah, bring the mats.
- All in peace?

790
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,110
- Peace.
- Thanks.

791
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,711
Be seated.

792
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,155
- Collé.
- Yes.

793
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:21,076
- Salba, our condolences.
- Amen.

794
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:25,119
- Greetings, ladies.
- Bathily. Bathily.

795
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:28,556
- I am heading for the mosque.
- Well.

796
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,438
- Pray for us.
- Allah willing.

797
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,835
Elder, your husband looks pained.

798
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,518
He is remorseful.
It is Amath who manipulates him.

799
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,839
We are being told everyday
that a woman bilakoro smells bad,

800
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,758
and yet nothing can smell worst
than a man who does not shower.

801
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,431
Sisters, I am pleased with your visit.

802
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,518
- Nafissatou.
- Yes.

803
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:11,117
Come reunite with your mothers.
From now on, the moolaade has ended.

804
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,670
- Amsatou.
- Yes.

805
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,593
Bring water.

806
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,439
- Mah.
- Yes.

807
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,319
Bring the girls' loincloths.

808
01:41:54,240 --> 01:42:00,349
My Diattou died in my arms.

809
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:13,115
Collé, we too felt the blows.

810
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:25,111
I was so choked up
that I peed in my pants.

811
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:32,312
Collé, we honour your resistance.

812
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:43,075
Any other mother
would have done what I did.

813
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,279
Salba, dry your tears.

814
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:52,468
Coumba, Ibatou, my condolences.

815
01:42:53,920 --> 01:43:00,678
Diattou's blood was dripping on my arms.

816
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:07,757
Diattou shouted her hate for purification.
My Diattou, my Diattou.

817
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:13,995
Collé, purification
robbed me of my daughter.

818
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,115
Oh, my Diattou!

819
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,271
- Oumy.
- Yes.

820
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,192
Your loincloth.

821
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,071
Nafissatou. Yours.

822
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,194
Awa. Your loincloth.

823
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:48,312
Salba.

824
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,311
Salba.

825
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,839
Salba.

826
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,152
I can hear her screams.

827
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:15,876
I want to follow my daughter.

828
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,070
Diattou.

829
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,435
Diattou, come here, here.

830
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,951
Diattou, here.

831
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:13,071
No, no, I don't want to!
I don't want to get cut.

832
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:46,114
No, don't cut me!
I don't want to.

833
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,831
Mothers,

834
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,315
be my witnesses.

835
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,871
Salba.

836
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:42,238
Here is your goddaughter,
have her for life.

837
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,435
This one will not be cut.

838
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,990
No girl will ever get cut.

839
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,432
No girl will ever get cut.

840
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:55,913
Why are these females still bitching?

841
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:02,713
They are aroused by Collé's resistance.

842
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:07,431
Do what they please
but no one will marry a bilakoro.

843
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,797
- Never.
- Never.

844
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,598
Our radios.
Our radios ablaze.

845
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,797
This one will not get cut.

846
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,032
- No girl will ever get cut again.
- Never ever again.

847
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:29,712
Our radios.

848
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,391
Allah!

849
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,315
Our radios blazing.

850
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:47,918
Some give birth, others kill!

851
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:55,516
The child killers are here.

852
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:02,312
- They will no longer cut anyone.
- Let's end our genital mutilations!

853
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:07,511
Calm down.
Calm down.

854
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:15,556
- No girl will get cut.
- Forever!

855
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,756
Throw your knife, quick.

856
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,913
Are you deaf?
Throw your knife.

857
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,951
Your knife.

858
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,471
Now yours.

859
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:13,591
No girl will ever get cut again.

860
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:18,153
I am going to confront the men.

861
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:24,509
Give it to them. Now or never, let's put
an end to female genital mutilations.

862
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,830
But don't forget the knives.

863
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,197
This day will see the end of our ordeal.
I am coming too.

864
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:35,593
Hope gives birth to courage.
Women's hope.

865
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,957
What is this?

866
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:54,397
Brother, if you don't subdue your wife,
I'll do it.

867
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,879
Elder, Collé is not a newborn.

868
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,033
If you touch her, I'll deal with you!

869
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:08,876
- He lost it.
- Brother-in-law.

870
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,952
You already burnt our radios.

871
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:14,315
But if you raise your hand on me,

872
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:20,396
I, Collé Ardo, will set the village on fire
and drown it in blood.

873
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,880
My warrior has spoken.

874
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,239
Admire my noble warrior.

875
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:35,428
Collé Ardo Gallo Sy has spoken

876
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:39,354
Collé from Niani has spoken

877
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:44,275
Djerisso women, fasten your belts

878
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:48,069
You are more valiant than men

879
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:54,353
Sanata, shut the fuck up!
You are but from a lower caste.

880
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:59,514
You are scared of the radios.
Fear also lead you to murder Mercenaire.

881
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:02,513
Collé Ardo, take away this filth.

882
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:12,911
Collé Ardo, be reminded that purification
is a legacy decreed by Islam.

883
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:19,392
Here are the knives
the salindana use to mutilate us.

884
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,913
Purification is not required by Islam.

885
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,831
The Grand Imam said it on the radio.

886
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,869
Each year millions of women
go for pilgrimage to Mecca.

887
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:40,270
- All have not been cut.
- Astarfirou Allah.

888
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:45,275
You are Satan.
Satan himself!

889
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:24,553
Balla, let's get out of here.

890
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:28,319
Ciré, you are betraying your menfolk!

891
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:32,678
It takes more than a pair of balls
to make a man.

892
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,478
- Ibrahima!
- Father.

893
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,632
You will not marry this bilakoro.

894
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:32,317
Father, my marriage is my own business.

895
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:39,590
Cursed son, challenge me
and I shall disinherit you.

896
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,508
You will have a bad ending.

897
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:02,512
Father, it is easy to hit a son,

898
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:09,908
but the era of little tyrants is over.
Forever and ever.

899
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,833
From now on I'll have the TV on.

900
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,111
Son of a bitch!

901
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:31,711
I am and shall remain a bilakoro!

902
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:14,352

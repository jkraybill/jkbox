1
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,347
What are you so scared of?

2
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,308
If you move, you'll
get stabbed in the face.

3
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:07,276
P-Please stop this!

4
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,488
Dumb-ass. Stop crying.

5
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,618
As punishment, we'll all
throw our knives at once.

6
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:19,372
Ready, set...

7
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,998
Cut that out!

8
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:31,175
What if that kid gets
stabbed by your knives?

9
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,597
Who are you?

10
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:39,725
This is none of your business.

11
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,729
Unfortunately, it is my business.

12
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,276
You remember, don't you?

13
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,654
Yu Hyuga. My little brother.

14
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,283
You bullied him to death.

15
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:58,411
I have no idea who that is.

16
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,788
Oh, really?

17
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:06,460
Even if you don't remember him,
he's waiting for you in hell!

18
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:10,673
I'm gonna kill you!

19
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,412
Stop screaming so pathetically.
You're a man, aren't you?

20
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,041
You won't die from
getting your hand cut off.

21
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,876
After all...

22
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,837
I only have one arm too!

23
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,619
I'll blast you to pieces!

24
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,505
That thing is real! NO fair!

25
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,006
So what?

26
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:23,931
Hey!

27
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,958
Are you okay?

28
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,253
You're safe now.

29
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,340
Murderer... Murderer...

30
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,425
Murderer!

31
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,598
That's right. I am a murderer.

32
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:53,479
But until a half year ago, I was
a normal high schooler who was able...

33
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:56,774
...to hold her little
brother with her left arm.

34
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,445
Here we go, Yoshie.

35
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:02,863
All right!

36
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,741
Wait up!

37
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,537
Wait, Ami!

38
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,873
Wait! Wait!

39
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,128
Nice shot! You're amazing, Ami!

40
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,590
You're really something. So cool.

41
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,135
If you were a boy,
I might have fallen for you.

42
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,512
Stop it.

43
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,890
I don't want a girl
to have a crush on me.

44
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,436
But it looks like
it's not that way after all.

45
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,479
How so?

46
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:39,316
Because it looks
like you have a young fan.

47
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,193
You're so popular!

48
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,779
And he's so cute. I'm jealous.

49
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,324
Dummy. That's my little brother, Yu.

50
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:02,006
I'm impressed, Sis. I had no idea
you were so good at basketball.

51
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,466
You're always lying around the house.

52
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,801
Quiet, you.

53
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,680
So Why'd you stop by today?

54
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,311
There's always something going on
when you come visit me like that.

55
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,565
I'll pay you back, so please lend
me money to buy a new game!

56
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,650
I knew it.

57
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,027
No way.

58
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,447
We don't have that
kind of money to spend.

59
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,116
Sis, please. I really want it.

60
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,494
I'll clean up every day,
even wash the dishes.

61
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,080
Sis. Come on, Sis.

62
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,919
Really?

63
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,931
Yu.

64
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,225
Takeshi, how much did you bring?

65
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,938
I took 10,000 yen from my mom.

66
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,398
I see. Me too.

67
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,027
They're not gonna be happy.

68
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,965
Hello, it's Yu.

69
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,383
It's Takeshi.

70
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,343
Excuse us.

71
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,388
You're late.

72
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,931
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,817
Where's the money?

74
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,445
Hurry up and hand it over.

75
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,784
This isn't even half
of what we agreed on.

76
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,412
Hey!

77
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,873
Hey, Yu...

78
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,544
How'd you get that money?

79
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,548
I borrowed it from my sister.

80
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,933
Then I expect you to get
more by tomorrow. 200,000 yen.

81
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:24,815
If you can't, then I'll make your
sister work at my dad's whorehouse.

82
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,359
She has nothing to do with this!

83
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,821
Who do you think you are?

84
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,703
Don't get me wrong.

85
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,289
I don't really want your money.

86
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,461
I just wanna have fun
by seeing you guys suffer.

87
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,610
Teppei...
He's a peon, but he's cunning.

88
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,531
Ryota Fujii... He's just a coward.

89
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,498
But the one I hate most
is the leader, Sho Kimura.

90
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,418
It's morning! Wake...

91
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,296
Oh, you got up early.

92
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:35,135
We're having fried chicken for
breakfast. They're still hot and tasty.

93
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,261
Hot!

94
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,849
Hey, what happened to your face?

95
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,184
I fell.

96
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,144
That can't be.

97
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,272
Come back here.

98
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,609
Yu, tell me the truth.

99
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,487
Okay, I got into
a fight and got pummeled.

100
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,405
You weren't bullied?

101
00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:00,786
NO, I'm not that hopeless. I hit
a classmate who pissed me off.

102
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,037
Watch it.

103
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,457
You've done it now.
I won't go easy on you.

104
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:11,004
You shouldn't use violence like that.
Remember what Dad used to say'?

105
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,714
Jeez.

106
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,512
Violence doesn't solve anything.
It only hurts people.

107
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,684
You and I fully understand that.

108
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:35,404
When Mom and Dad killed
themselves over murder allegations...

109
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,322
We promised then.

110
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,659
Not to lose loved ones.

111
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,288
To always be there for each other.

112
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:49,334
NO matter what happens,
I'm going to protect you.

113
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,795
Sis...

114
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,166
Listen, Sho.

115
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:37,007
Whatever you do, do not ever bring
shame to our Hanzo Hattori clan.

116
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,679
I know, Dad.

117
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:51,438
We may be yakuza now,
but never lose your ninja pride.

118
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,734
Never let your guard down.

119
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:56,860
Never!

120
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,286
Everyone except
yourself is an enemy!

121
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,081
Think of them as slaves, right?

122
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,290
That's right!

123
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,043
Do not fear blades.

124
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,504
Use them to destroy your enemy!

125
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,839
Destroy! Destroy!

126
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,094
Very good.

127
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,681
You are my flesh and blood.

128
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,853
I will make our bond even greater.

129
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,902
A cup of my own blood.

130
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,698
Drink it to strengthen our bond.

131
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,201
Drink it...

132
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,870
Drink more...

133
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,541
Drink it...

134
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,586
She...

135
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,384
As long as you're around,
our clan will never die.

136
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,056
You are my treasure!

137
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,603
Master, your breakfast is ready.

138
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,816
Hey.

139
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,278
You must be new.

140
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,868
How dare you interrupt our sacred
ritual between father and son?

141
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,786
You!

142
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,792
Young master, have a good day.

143
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,675
Good morning, Mom.
What are you doing?

144
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,677
Oh, good morning.

145
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:50,599
This maid's been messing
up a lot, so I'm punishing her.

146
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,601
Have a nice day.

147
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,066
Have a nice day!

148
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,989
She was a terrible maid.

149
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,576
Bye-bye.

150
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,833
Have a nice day.

151
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,473
Where are you going?
School's the other way.

152
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,642
Where's the money?

153
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,522
Wait! Come back!

154
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,401
What the hell?

155
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,736
Watch where you're going!

156
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,865
Come here, you! Come on!

157
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:50,909
You open?

158
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,327
Hello.

159
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,915
Excuse me! Is Takeshi here?

160
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,294
Hey! Wait! Who are you?

161
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,842
What's wrong with kids these days?
They don't even say hello.

162
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,761
Miki, do you know that kid?

163
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,805
Miki?

164
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,686
What was that?

165
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,567
I'm scared... I'm scared...

166
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,113
Those guys are... It's me.
We're in trouble. Run for it.

167
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,114
What should we do?

168
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,825
What should we do?
What do you want with Takeshi?

169
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,701
Sorry...

170
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,745
Ma, this is my friend, Yu Hyuga.

171
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,836
You're the son of
those alleged murderers.

172
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,882
That's not true! My dad
was framed and killed himself.

173
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,800
I don't care.

174
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,429
Just stay away from my son.

175
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,972
GO home!

176
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,058
Takeshi? Takeshi!

177
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,270
Takeshi, where are you going?

178
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,688
Takeshi!

179
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:04,566
Ready?

180
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,484
Okay.

181
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,860
Go for it!

182
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:12,073
You're amazing!
Nice shot! Just as I expected!

183
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,411
I'm jealous of you. Seeing you
and Yu get along like that.

184
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:20,081
He seems like a nice kid.
He must be easy to deal with.

185
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,000
That's not true.

186
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,921
He's very selfish.
I don't know what to do with him.

187
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,966
This is bad!

188
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,470
Y-Yoshie, excuse me.

189
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,472
W-Wait, Ami!

190
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,225
Where are you going? Jeez...

191
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,443
Hold it!

192
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,154
Where do you think you're going?

193
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,406
Stop running away, man!

194
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:04,960
Sorry...

195
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,294
Hey.

196
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,837
Where to, girl?

197
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,214
I'm in a rush.

198
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,342
What's the rush?
Where are you going?

199
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,802
Stop!

200
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,890
Who do you think you are?

201
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,893
No! No! Stop!

202
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:22,978
No!

203
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,481
Stop...

204
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,900
No! Stop!

205
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,740
What are you thinking?

206
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,826
You broke your promise.

207
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,706
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for a yakuza's son'?

208
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,676
Stop!

209
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,636
Stop!

210
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,522
Beating on you two isn't much fun.

211
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,067
I think I want Yu's sister to be my toy.

212
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,280
I hear she's got big tits,
and she's cute. GO find her.

213
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:22,454
Don't you dare lay
a finger on my sister!

214
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,345
You sissies. You pissed me off.

215
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,265
I won't take it easy on you!

216
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,351
What the hell?

217
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,658
Yu!

218
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,932
You're pretty strong.
Is your sister strong too?

219
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,809
She's much stronger!

220
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,478
Then she should've trained you better.

221
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,322
Takeshi"

222
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,034
Are you okay?

223
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,869
Yu, I'm scared...

224
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,872
Shut up!

225
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,253
Takeshi

226
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,255
Takeshi

227
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,098
See ya.

228
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,280
Sis...

229
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,828
Yu?

230
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,505
Yu...

231
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,341
Yu!

232
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,120
Yu...

233
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,498
Yu...

234
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,793
This is some kind of joke, right?

235
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,450
Sugihara Motors

236
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,878
Takeshi"

237
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,299
Why did you have to go?

238
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,553
Takeshi"

239
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,847
Takeshi"

240
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,057
Excuse me.

241
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,613
Who are you?

242
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,449
I'm Yu's older sister.

243
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,912
I'm so sorry about Takeshi...

244
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,582
What do you want?

245
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,252
The police are trying
to call it a suicide.

246
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,716
But I know someone was
responsible for their deaths.

247
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,511
If only I had a lead...

248
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:49,804
Stop it.

249
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,100
I don't want you playing the victim.

250
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,560
Look.

251
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:01,566
If it weren't for your brother,
Takeshi would still be alive!

252
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:03,902
But...

253
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,071
You people are murderers.

254
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,116
Your family brings misfortune
to everyone around you!

255
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,409
Stop it!

256
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,244
Get out of here!

257
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:14,537
MM .

258
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:31,471
Neither Yu, Dad, nor 1
would ever kill anyone...

259
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,358
There's no way Yu would kill himself.

260
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,819
No way.

261
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,325
Someone forced him into it.

262
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,995
Someone must've killed him!

263
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,185
"People I want to kill."

264
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,604
What is this?

265
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,526
Why didn't I find out sooner?

266
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,738
Yu...

267
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,740
I'm sorry!

268
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,226
I'm sorry.

269
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,605
I'm not sure about tempura
in the morning. Is it okay?

270
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,168
The incident with your
brother breaks my heart.

271
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,171
I'm sad since I was his friend.

272
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,427
Ryota, who's the leader of the group?

273
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,724
Ryota needs to get to school, so...

274
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,852
Wait.

275
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:46,230
Well, I'm going.
Make yourself at home.

276
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,775
So...

277
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:55,448
Are you saying that our
Ryota bullied your brother?

278
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,620
This diary is proof.

279
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,916
I'd like you to come to
the police precinct with me.

280
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,667
You're an idiot!

281
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:13,091
We've been in the police business
ever since my grandfather's time.

282
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,095
You're Hyuga, right?

283
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,432
I know that your father is a murderer.

284
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,062
Trying to falsely accuse my son...

285
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,900
What do you want?

286
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,736
Murderer!

287
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,240
What?

288
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:43,121
If he was being bullied...

289
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,834
...maybe it was because something
was wrong with your brother.

290
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,879
I don't want you blaming us
for your brother's problems.

291
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,510
Please stop.

292
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,097
I want to talk calmly.

293
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,932
I can't talk to you.

294
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:09,438
A minx like you should be arrested!

295
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,199
Stop!
There's no need for this violence!

296
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,911
I'm doing this to protect my son!

297
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:32,753
Please stop!

298
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,786
It's hot!

299
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,590
Oh, it fried up very nicely.

300
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,634
Such tasty tempura.

301
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,226
Hot! Hot! Hot!

302
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,525
Damn it!

303
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,194
H-Honey!

304
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,907
Honey, are you okay?

305
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,994
Don't call the cops.

306
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,540
I'll find her and finish her off!

307
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,676
It stings.

308
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,052
Oh, it stings...

309
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,428
It stings.

310
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,305
L4tsflngs™.

311
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,099
Ow...

312
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,934
Ow...

313
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:34,792
Stop.

314
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,379
If you make a noise, I'll slit your throat.

315
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:42,717
Now apologize to Yu
and tell me who your leader is.

316
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,051
I don't know.

317
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:51,517
I'll tell you. The leader is
a yakuza's son, Sho Kimura!

318
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,894
Sho Kimura?

319
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,525
I can't breathe... Murderer...

320
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,988
I always believed that it was
wrong to kill no matter what.

321
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:08,367
But I learned from your parents...

322
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,330
...that there's a time and place for it!

323
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,426
A blackout?

324
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,868
Ryota!

325
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,652
I hope you rot in hell together!

326
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,497
Mother, there's no conditioner.
Can you get some?

327
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,586
Sir, how about
an unusual conditioner?

328
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,340
It can't be... you!

329
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,892
Ryota!

330
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,853
Wash your hair with your son's blood!

331
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,067
Ryota!

332
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,240
RYOTA??

333
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,368
Please, God!

334
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,541
Serves you right.

335
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,723
I'm a demon! I turned into a demon!

336
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:28,817
I'll remain a demon until I kill
every last one of Yu's enemies!

337
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,329
Delicious.

338
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,466
Here are your noodles and soup...

339
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
Hot!

340
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,972
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

341
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,642
What'll you do
about the master's leg?

342
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,603
I don't like that look on your face!

343
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:08,440
Hey!

344
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,446
Keep it down.

345
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,960
Sorry about that.

346
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:33,424
You must be the new chef, right?

347
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,758
Yes...

348
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,552
Got kids?

349
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:37,636
No.

350
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,267
Kids are great.

351
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:51,358
I did a lot of bad things in
my life, but my kids need me.

352
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,073
Sho means everything to me.

353
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,285
I live because of him.

354
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,707
And you caused him great pain...

355
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,004
Cut off a finger as an apology!

356
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:14,923
Please forgive me!

357
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,640
Honey, that's not right.

358
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,643
You always do this.

359
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,979
I'm really sorry about all this.

360
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:33,776
You're too soft!

361
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:41,492
Even all five fingers wouldn't
be enough to make it up to Sho!

362
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:46,997
I am formerly of the Kanto Beasts!
Don't fuck with me!

363
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,708
No!

364
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,836
If you don't want to die...

365
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:58,842
...then at least apologize like
the true chef you are, huh?

366
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:10,020
Excuse me. I want
to ask you for directions.

367
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,564
Where do you need to go?

368
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,067
Where's Sho Kimura?

369
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,695
Take me to him!

370
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:24,368
Now, eat some sushi...

371
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:29,164
Eat as much as you want...

372
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,171
GO ahead and eat.

373
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,592
If you say so...

374
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,227
How do your fingers taste?

375
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,650
We need a new
chef starting tomorrow.

376
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,278
I'm going to the bathroom.

377
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:26,930
You're Sho Kimura?

378
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,516
Who the hell are you?

379
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,685
What was that sound?

380
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:32,895
Sho!

381
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,190
Who the hell are you?

382
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,859
Stay back or I'll slit his throat.

383
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:42,613
I'm not afraid to die.
I just want to kill him.

384
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,494
NO way. You can't kill me.

385
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,454
What's that?

386
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,251
You won't get away! Someone!

387
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,544
Right!

388
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,812
She's good.

389
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,184
You...

390
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,437
You killed my Yu!

391
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,320
GO through!

392
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:24,047
You did pretty good for a girl.

393
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,051
But it's over now.

394
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:32,347
I'm sure you know what's
going to happen to you, right?

395
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,372
Yu's sister, I feel sorry for you.

396
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,416
You were so close.

397
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,755
Wounds from burns and a katana.
Your arm is a mess, girl.

398
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:12,095
We, the Hattori clan, won't kill
our enemy after they're captured.

399
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:19,311
We give them a taste
of hell before killing them.

400
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:26,485
I thought your stupid
son was the crazy one...

401
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:33,158
...but you're all insane!

402
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,665
You have pretty fingers...

403
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:46,672
I can't believe these belong
to such a strong girl like you...

404
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:53,178
Slice, slice, slice these fingers off...

405
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,057
O great Hanzo Hattori.

406
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:01,603
Provide this girl with
great pain and suffering.

407
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:11,363
It hurts!

408
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:20,664
That was for all three of us.

409
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,876
But we're not done yet.

410
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,215
Now this is from the great Hanzo!

411
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:44,021
It looks pretty nice without any fingers.

412
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,318
I think that's enough for today.

413
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:52,070
One minute.

414
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,197
Wait.

415
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,993
You should keep going, honey!

416
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:02,914
Torture isn't fun unless
you do it a little bit at a time.

417
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:08,045
That's why you're too soft.
You should finish her off at once!

418
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,672
You shut up and let me do my job!

419
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,590
I'm gonna give you a painkiller.

420
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,093
The boss is being kind.

421
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:01,765
It's a shame you're
gonna be hacked up tomorrow.

422
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,145
Such a nice body.

423
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:14,236
Give me the key
to unlock this chain! Now!

424
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:24,037
What is this?

425
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,082
Shit. She escaped.

426
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,502
Hey! Someone!

427
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:33,797
What's wrong?

428
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,257
That girl...

429
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:42,764
That bitch... Where did she go?

430
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:49,771
Like I said,
you were too easy on her!

431
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:55,652
Find her and kill her.

432
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:34,858
Yu...

433
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,486
Where are you taking me?

434
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,517
Don't overdo it.

435
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,563
You won't be able to work
efficiently even if you work overtime.

436
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:14,522
I'll take over.

437
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,149
Don't.

438
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,986
I want to keep working.

439
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:26,743
If I stop working for even a bit,
I start to think about Takeshi.

440
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:28,912
I see...

441
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,840
Hey, Miki!

442
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:42,968
Someone's collapsed outside!

443
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,053
Hey! Are you okay?

444
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:47,597
Hey!Hey!Hey!

445
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,725
Hey, Miki...

446
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,144
Are you okay? Hey!

447
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:54,771
Hey!

448
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,606
This girl...

449
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:13,164
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

450
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,584
Yeah. Don't worry.

451
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:20,005
I'm the son of a doctor.

452
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:26,970
When I was in the biker gang, I fixed
up buddies who got hurt in fights.

453
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,931
Including you.

454
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:36,104
Hey, you're going to throw her
out when she wakes up, right?

455
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,649
I don't want to get
dragged into anything.

456
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,321
Even if it has something
to do with Takeshi's death?

457
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:49,159
I'm sure she's like this
because she discovered the truth.

458
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,287
It's not safe for her out there.

459
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,290
So you want to keep her here?

460
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,584
No way.

461
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,589
You have nothing against her, right?

462
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,511
Hey, are you okay?

463
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,730
You...

464
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:30,909
I'm home.

465
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,131
NO! Who are you people?

466
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:47,133
NO! Get off of me!

467
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:57,268
Sorry to barge in.

468
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:04,275
We hear that you're
best friends with Ami Hyuga.

469
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,573
Is she here?

470
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:16,037
I don't know what you're
talking about. She's not here!

471
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:19,874
I'm not involved with anything!

472
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:24,796
I don't know any Ami.

473
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,424
I don't know her!

474
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,300
I see.

475
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,720
I apologize then.

476
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:36,850
She wasn't here after all, huh?

477
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:41,521
Then we have to keep
you quiet about all this.

478
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:05,420
Hey, why don't you do it with her?

479
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:06,963
Right.

480
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:11,468
It's not often that
you get to do a college girl.

481
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,143
Where the hell did she go?

482
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,208
You can eat a rice ball
with one hand, right? Here.

483
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,923
So what you told us is true?

484
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,468
Takeshi was killed by a yakuza's son?

485
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,221
I wouldn't have lost
my arm if it weren't true.

486
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,224
Who and where is he? Tell me!

487
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:04,270
Shut up. I thought you didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

488
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:07,982
Is that how you talk
to people who saved your life?

489
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:13,238
You told me once
not to play the victim.

490
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,407
Well, right back at you!

491
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,629
Now you did it.

492
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:34,926
I don't give a damn
if you only have one arm!

493
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:45,436
Hey... What are you doing, Miki?

494
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,814
She hasn't recovered yet.

495
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,732
Please don't stop us.

496
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:54,612
No matter what shape I'm in,
I just want to settle this.

497
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,367
It's a battle between those
who've lost loved ones.

498
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:23,057
The loser will be covered in blood.

499
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,896
I cant lose.

500
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:36,863
NO matter what happens to my body,
I have to seek revenge for Yu's sake!

501
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:38,573
Me too.

502
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:44,287
I'm furious with myself for not
being able to protect Takeshi!

503
00:52:57,884 --> 00:52:58,718
Ow!

504
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,514
Are you okay?

505
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:10,021
Ami, you're pretty good
even if you only have one arm.

506
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,360
You came at me
with everything you had.

507
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,236
I like that.

508
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:22,909
Mind if I join you
in getting your revenge?

509
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,995
You'll be with a murderer.

510
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,622
Are you sure?

511
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:30,124
They're my enemies too.

512
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:34,587
Besides, if there's a way to get
revenge by not killing people...

513
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,006
...then I'd like to know it.

514
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:40,760
It's kill, kill, kill.

515
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:58,444
Ami, it must be hard
to fight with that kind of body.

516
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,531
I'll make you a new arm.

517
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,908
One made of steel.

518
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:44,574
You think you can
avenge your brother like that?

519
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,910
He won't be able
to rest in peace, you idiot!

520
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:55,460
It's tough!

521
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:58,004
This training is for moving forward!

522
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,715
You didn't even move a millimeter.

523
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,134
Come on! Keep going!

524
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,449
Cute face.

525
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,243
Those are the eyes. Remember that!

526
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,217
Can I help you?

527
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,805
The Kimuras moved away recently.

528
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:50,515
Where?

529
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,975
How should I know?

530
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:55,895
But I'm glad the yakuza are gone.

531
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:57,814
Thank you.

532
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:21,629
.

533
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:23,923
Oh, Ami.

534
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:26,926
I'm almost done.

535
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,638
Thank you... for everything.

536
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,685
I hope you'll stay friends with my wife.

537
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,315
She can't have any more kids.

538
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:47,530
I wasn't able to understand her pain.

539
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:50,324
But, Arm...

540
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,495
She was saved by meeting you.

541
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:59,208
So please take good care of her.

542
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,503
I Will.

543
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,716
Ami! We have a problem!

544
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,801
The Kimura family's gone.

545
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:09,886
What?

546
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,929
They're up to something.

547
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:14,849
Hey, do you hear a strange noise?

548
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,364
The machine gun...

549
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:31,782
Okay!

550
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:40,750
All right, calm down... Calm down...

551
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:47,924
We are...

552
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:54,722
...the Junior High Shuriken Gang!

553
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,566
Whoa.

554
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,195
Takeshi's house is really dirty.

555
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:16,202
Excuse me, but could
you stop wandering around?

556
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,039
Your family members
died on their own...

557
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:22,500
...so don't hold a grudge against us.

558
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,835
Honestly, it's disturbing.

559
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,340
I'm going to kill that bastard!

560
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,593
You stupid brat.

561
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,680
You're gonna get it!

562
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,470
We might get killed first!

563
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:31,902
The wire...

564
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:37,700
Honey, is that
machine gun finished yet?

565
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:41,245
Hang on! I just have
to attach the trigger!

566
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,034
Aw, looks like it's over now.

567
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,080
Damn it...

568
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,796
It went in! Yes! It's done!

569
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:36,383
I'm finished...

570
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,766
Ami! Take it!

571
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:34,358
Honey!

572
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,403
Honey! Honey!

573
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:16,817
Shit...

574
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:18,485
She's pretty good...

575
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:27,828
I'm hit!

576
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,967
Mommy...

577
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,136
Mommy...

578
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,792
Honey! Honey...

579
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:18,712
Honey...

580
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,340
No!

581
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,512
Honey! Honey!

582
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:30,474
Honey...

583
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,268
Suguru...

584
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,529
.

585
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,875
Damn it... Who killed my son?

586
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,259
I'll never forgive... Who killed him?

587
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:09,179
I'm sorry about your loss.

588
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,353
I know who killed your sons.

589
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,358
Do you want me to help you'?

590
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,307
There's no point hiding here.

591
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:59,646
My boss will find you two
and send out an assassin.

592
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,985
I'm not running away.

593
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,988
I'm just waiting for
my chance for revenge.

594
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:14,787
Stop bluffing and
give me something to eat.

595
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:19,792
I'm hungry. I'm really hungry.

596
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:24,671
If I kill you, then I won't know
where to find the Kimuras.

597
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:27,633
So I'll let you live for now!

598
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,635
Here's a rice ball.

599
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:31,595
Eat it.

600
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,348
Come on.

601
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:40,979
Thanks.

602
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:46,360
But that kindness
happens to be your weakness.

603
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:56,245
Thank you for coming.

604
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:05,587
I know that you have all lost
your children for no good reason.

605
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:12,761
Your enemies will surely come here.

606
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:20,144
I want to help you get your revenge!

607
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:27,025
We're going to kill those women!

608
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:33,991
Ryota!

609
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,624
Damn...

610
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,879
I can't believe I screwed up...

611
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,218
Ami.

612
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:56,472
Did you find out
where the Kimuras are?

613
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,933
I really want to kill them.

614
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:03,896
Miki?

615
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,608
Miki, let me take a look.

616
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,026
No...

617
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,738
It looks bad...

618
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:17,576
Her wound is getting infected.

619
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:21,538
She'll die if you don't
get her to a hospital.

620
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,668
Miki... You can't fight like this.

621
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:31,131
Let's go to the nearest
hospital to get you fixed up.

622
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,300
Wait a minute...

623
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,429
You want to go without me?
You've gotta be kidding me.

624
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,768
I can't just relax without
getting my revenge!

625
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,269
No!

626
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:48,815
Miki?

627
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,902
'ZZZ

628
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:55,864
I don't want you to die.

629
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:02,663
I'll be the one to die
after getting our revenge.

630
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:13,340
So I don't want you to die.

631
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:18,595
I lost everyone I loved.

632
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,183
I have no more hope left.

633
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,438
But after I met you...

634
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:33,527
...was able to understand
what it's like to protect someone.

635
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:36,780
MM .

636
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:43,036
You're the only one who
means something to me now.

637
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:51,169
Thanks, Ami.

638
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:56,049
But I lost my husband and Takeshi.

639
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,845
I'm as good as dead.

640
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:08,687
If I don't crush the Kimuras,
then they'll never rest in peace.

641
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:13,775
Ami...

642
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:22,826
Ami, I'm begging YO"-

643
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:31,293
Please let me die in peace.

644
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,632
Miki...

645
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:42,638
Come on.

646
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,474
We don't have much time.

647
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,644
Tell me where the Kimuras are hiding.

648
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:55,901
I'm not going to tell you
even if you bash my head in!

649
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,235
I see.

650
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:04,284
Hey, what are you doing?

651
01:10:04,785 --> 01:10:06,662
Stop messing around...

652
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,248
Stop! Stop!

653
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:11,958
Stop it...

654
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:16,838
You nailed me!

655
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,299
Using a nail isn't fair!

656
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,593
Stop complaining.

657
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,098
We're risking our lives, you know!

658
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:31,269
Miki, let's go.

659
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:36,149
Let's go on a journey to hell
in order to kill the Kimuras!

660
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:44,783
It's time to get your revenge.

661
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,099
This is too much! NO more!

662
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:57,856
The Kimuras have
a hideout at Ichinooka Shrine.

663
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:00,859
Ichinooka Shrine?

664
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:17,292
This is the way
to Ichinooka Shrine, right?

665
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:22,339
Ami, if you can't use your machine
gun, use the weapons in this bag.

666
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,468
We're running short
on machine-gun bullets.

667
01:12:26,802 --> 01:12:28,386
You can use...

668
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,514
This.

669
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:33,391
These bullets are very powerful.

670
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:36,561
It's nothing like the other ones.

671
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,023
Use it to finish your opponent.

672
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:44,569
It's got too much power and might
just destroy your machine gun.

673
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,783
Think of it as
a last present from Suguru.

674
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:51,785
Okay.

675
01:12:55,497 --> 01:13:00,669
Even with a weapon like that,
the two of you are gonna get killed.

676
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,924
But it's impressive that
you got the boss all fired up.

677
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,635
Shut up.

678
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,681
Come on, Arm.

679
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:15,725
Let's go!

680
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:59,185
What? You actually came?

681
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,980
My parents are angry.

682
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,817
Why don't you just die
before you complicate things?

683
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,488
What? You little punk!

684
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,035
Huh? What's this?

685
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,486
H v U

686
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,863
Tomokazu...

687
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,157
Takeshi"

688
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:55,951
Yoshio...

689
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:57,160
H v U

690
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:58,912
Tomokazu...

691
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:01,289
Takeshi"

692
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:16,054
I'll give you credit for coming this far.

693
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:21,309
I'll do whatever
it takes to protect our son!

694
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:30,068
You're not the only ones who can
become demons for your families.

695
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:33,405
Listen!

696
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:44,874
We have gathered to punish
you for our sons' deaths.

697
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,920
We're the Super Mourner Gang!

698
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:55,510
Shit... You bastards...

699
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:59,639
Feel the wrath of my son!

700
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,197
Am".!

701
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:45,852
You killed my son!

702
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:47,562
Give him back!

703
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:56,237
NO way.
Bulletproof vests under the pictures...

704
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,084
.

705
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:08,393
Tomokazu! I'm sorry!

706
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:42,594
I'm out of bullets.

707
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,748
Wrong target.

708
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,128
Thanks for waiting, Ami.

709
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,424
Do you think you can kill me?

710
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:25,053
My most deadly ninja weapon.

711
01:19:25,637 --> 01:19:28,097
The executioner's blade. Take this!

712
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:28,700
Takeshi"

713
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,204
Ami.

714
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,971
Here we go! Take this!

715
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:24,130
Miki!

716
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,133
Miki!

717
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:35,183
Ami...

718
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,102
Don't worry about me...

719
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:40,188
Kill the Kimuras.

720
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:44,901
You have to kill them for me!

721
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:55,912
I've chopped off such a useless thing.

722
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,250
In a matter of minutes, you will die.

723
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,463
Then you won't be able
to hold a grudge against me.

724
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:09,092
But if you still want to kill me...

725
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:12,136
...then come this way!

726
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,810
How dare you do this to Miki...

727
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,396
Miki...

728
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,233
GO...

729
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:47,588
Die in front of our great Hanzo's spirit!

730
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:07,483
You will perish.

731
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:12,071
Apologize to the great
Hanzo in the afterlife!

732
01:23:26,586 --> 01:23:27,962
She...

733
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:33,217
I couldn't protect you...

734
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:43,019
Take that, you brutal yakuza.

735
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,691
Ami...Ami...

736
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,570
I-I... I'm coming...

737
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:55,031
You're not going anywhere!

738
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,644
Ryota!

739
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:28,606
Ryota!

740
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,372
Am".!

741
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:50,836
Don't let them beat you!

742
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:16,862
MM ...

743
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:27,123
Miki, I wish I could join you...

744
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,794
But I want you to wait for me...

745
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:34,797
Sho Kimura's still in the main hall...

746
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:41,596
I can't die until I take his head.

747
01:25:57,028 --> 01:25:59,614
Missy, I'm over here.

748
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:02,533
L-I'm scared... I'm scared...

749
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,581
I'm using these three as my shield.

750
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,376
If you want to kill me, go ahead.
But they're going to die too.

751
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:16,714
You're such a coward.

752
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:27,475
A ninja does whatever
it takes to survive.

753
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:35,066
Sho is much more of
a ninja than his father was.

754
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:40,071
That's because I raised him right.

755
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:43,366
You stupid bitch.

756
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:49,163
A person without love
can't possibly love their child!

757
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,982
NO way...
The chainsaw was deflected?

758
01:27:17,775 --> 01:27:19,110
I'm sorry.

759
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:22,405
I'm wearing a special bra.

760
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,366
A steel one.

761
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:26,784
A drill bra.

762
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:31,330
It can't be...

763
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:34,375
Yes, it can be.

764
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:41,424
What do you think of it?

765
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,267
Enjoy my drill.

766
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:09,910
Well?

767
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:29,346
Well?

768
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:32,308
How do you like my drill bra?

769
01:28:37,563 --> 01:28:40,316
Now I'll drill your face.

770
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:56,165
I'm scared... I'm scared...

771
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:37,248
.

772
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:38,541
Sho!

773
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,379
Are you okay?

774
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:50,678
This is for the ones you killed!

775
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:16,912
Your love turned out to be harmful...

776
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:19,790
I hope you both rot in hell!

777
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:36,849
Listen up. GO down
the mountain and get some help.

778
01:30:38,142 --> 01:30:42,771
Find the police and tell them
that lots of people have been killed...

779
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,983
...and that a girl
named Ami Hyuga did it.

780
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:47,985
GO on.

781
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:51,780
Even if you get bullied,
don't let them win.

782
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,198
Promise?

783
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:58,162
Yeah, I'll be strong like you one day.

784
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:17,014
.

785
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:20,684
I'm such a stupid sister.

786
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:24,813
You probably have nothing
but contempt for me now.

787
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:39,912
Yu...

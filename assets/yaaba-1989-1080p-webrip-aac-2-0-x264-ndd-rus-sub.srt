1
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,880
<i>For Watamou</i>

2
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,240
Mother, I miss you...

3
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,280
if only you could come back.

4
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,840
Say what you will.
She won't return.

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Bila,

6
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,480
the old woman is behind us.

7
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,640
Don't be afraid, she's leaving.

8
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,560
Is she really a witch?

9
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,920
I don't know...
but that's what everyone says.

10
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,840
She's following us!

11
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,280
Coward! Let's go...

12
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,040
Nopoko,

13
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm going to hide...

14
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,520
If you can find me,
I'll give you two coins.

15
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Alright!

16
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,920
One, two, three...

17
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,200
four, five, six, seven...

18
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,280
eight, nine, ten, eleven...

19
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,760
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

20
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,440
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen...

21
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,560
nineteen, twenty...

22
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,520
l'm starting now.

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,880
I've got you.

24
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,320
I want my money!
You promised me.

25
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,760
She helped you!

26
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,880
You tricked me.

27
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,280
There's nothing else we can do.

28
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm telling the truth.

29
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
lt was Bilgo's son
who set fire to the granary.

30
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
I saw him.

31
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,960
Noaga, you're drunk again.

32
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,760
You are all hypocrites.

33
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,080
Enough of your insults.

34
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,320
It's your mockery that makes him
drink so much.

35
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,440
You should be more considerate.

36
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,320
The witch...

37
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
She is the cause
of our misfortune

38
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,680
We should drive her from the village!

39
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,360
Pegda, you're a cruel woman.

40
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
We will all help him.

41
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Father...

42
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,600
The old woman is innocent.

43
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,040
What did you say?

44
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,680
Nothing at all.

45
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,120
Stop talking foolishness.

46
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,960
Go on and get your mother.

47
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,360
Idiot!

48
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,560
What makes you think
Sana had nothing to do with the fire?

49
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
Nopoko and I were at the cemetery...

50
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,520
and she was there too.

51
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,920
I have forbidden you to go
to the cemetery.

52
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,760
Kougri, stop
going on about it.

53
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,400
Don't start up again.

54
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,720
Koudi, greetings.

55
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,200
Razougou, what do you want?

56
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,760
I have a husband now...
Leave me in peace.

57
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,680
I love you,

58
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,680
leave that drunkard and
come away with me.

59
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,520
You haven't changed at all.

60
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,080
I love you, too.

61
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,040
Go on, we'll see each other later.

62
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,480
Now pay attention...

63
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,840
There's a lovely present for
whoever guesses correctly.

64
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
Who walks like this?

65
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,280
I know who...

66
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,320
It's Noaga, the alcoholic,
when he's drunk.

67
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Noraogo,

68
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,240
you've guessed it.

69
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,560
Nopoko will be your wife.

70
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,920
Nopoko,

71
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,640
here is your husband.

72
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,560
I don't want her...
My money!

73
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Who do you think you are?
You little shit!

74
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
There's the witch!

75
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,200
Come on!

76
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,720
I've hit her...

77
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,000
Stupid ass!

78
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,200
Animal!

79
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,520
Stay out of this.

80
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,080
Grab him! Grab his feet!

81
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
You fight dirty.

82
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,920
Get lost, bastard!

83
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
That's enough!

84
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Stop it!

85
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,680
You Bila, and you Noraogo,
be careful...

86
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,640
I've got my eye on you.

87
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,840
Now get going, clear off!

88
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,280
Come on.

89
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,720
I'll show Tibo who he's dealing with!

90
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
Tibo, listen...

91
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,480
Let me settle the score
with that bitch!

92
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,640
Forget about it. That woman
looks for trouble.

93
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,080
He's right. Forget about it.

94
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,720
You hear what she's saying?

95
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,720
Don't listen to her.

96
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,000
You're a coward,
let's see how you do against me!

97
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,480
You helped Bila beat
up my children, you pig!

98
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
Let's get out of here.

99
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,640
Calm down.

100
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,120
Noaga!

101
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,800
I want you.

102
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,760
Wake up...

103
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,600
An impotent fool,

104
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,280
that's all you are.

105
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,680
Greetings.

106
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

107
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,480
I can't stay long.

108
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Let's go!

109
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,320
Where?

110
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,840
It's a surprise.

111
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
You should leave that drunkard.

112
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,000
I can't do that.
Because of my family.

113
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,760
He's a fool, but he
is still my husband.

114
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,640
Let's hurry,
we don't have much time.

115
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,720
You!

116
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,800
Bastard!

117
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,680
Son of a bitch...
if I catch you, I'll strangle you!

118
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,680
Pig!

119
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,320
A thief... and it is all
your fault. Like mother, like son!

120
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,000
Idiot!

121
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,880
Come back here!

122
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,160
Open the door!

123
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,360
First of all,

124
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,480
take back what you just said.

125
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,040
Are you going crazy?

126
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,080
You know I'm not!

127
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm sorry.

128
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,360
What?

129
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,760
Please forgive me.

130
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,800
My beauty, open the door
and I will give you presents.

131
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,320
You're telling me stories.

132
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,320
No, I'm not lying.

133
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
In that case...

134
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
Ah, that's life!

135
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,760
Yaaba!

136
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,480
Here you are.

137
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,520
Where did you get that?

138
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
Did you steal it?

139
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,800
No,

140
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,560
uncle Tibo gave it to me.

141
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,000
Is that true?

142
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,360
Yes.

143
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,520
Then I'll accept it.

144
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,000
lt tastes very good.

145
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,160
It's too bad you have no teeth!

146
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,160
Stop making fun of me.

147
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,320
You know...

148
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,520
that's the first time someone
has called me Grandmother

149
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,360
and that makes me very happy.

150
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
He's a terrible boy!

151
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,560
Look!

152
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,000
Did you see what he did?

153
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,600
Rotten little kid, I'll teach you a lesson!

154
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,320
You're wrong.

155
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,520
What has he done to you?
– Everything!

156
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,560
Settle down.

157
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,120
Mind your own business!

158
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,720
Where were you?

159
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,680
I know.
He was with Sana...

160
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,760
Big mouth!

161
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,200
That's enough!

162
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,440
I'll bring him to his father.

163
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,520
You're going to be punished.

164
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,520
And you're going to hell!

165
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,600
I'm bringing Bila to you.
He was with Sana.

166
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
With Sana?

167
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Promise, you won't hit him.
– I promise.

168
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,320
Alright, I'll see you later.

169
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,640
Rascal, I warned you.

170
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,640
Quickly!

171
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,560
You've disobeyed me.

172
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,080
Faster!

173
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,560
Scram!

174
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,880
Quickly!

175
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,000
Maybe now you'll learn.

176
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,720
You're going too far,
leave him alone.

177
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,600
What did you say?

178
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,280
Go and play...

179
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,760
Tattle-tale!

180
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,600
This is all your fault,
I was in big trouble.

181
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,280
You'll change your tone
or I'll stop massaging you!

182
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,400
Look at this!

183
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,360
Where did you get it?

184
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,400
I don't know if I should tell you.

185
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,120
It's a gift from Sana,
but don't tell that...

186
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,520
to anyone.

187
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,040
Aunt has heard everything.

188
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Poko is a very good cook.

189
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,320
That's why I'm still in love with her.

190
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,120
Let's have another song!

191
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,560
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

192
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
You're like father,
you talk too much.

193
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,640
You're rude!

194
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,120
Go and fetch some water.

195
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,200
There's Bila!

196
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
You know,

197
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,840
with a nice pair of earrings
you could pass for a little girl...

198
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,080
You're stupid...

199
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,960
you've always been stupid.

200
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,160
I was kidding!

201
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,920
I didn't mean to offend you.

202
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,640
Let me carry the jug.

203
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,440
See, you can be kind too.

204
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,560
Let's go.

205
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,360
Wait for me here!

206
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,600
Where are you going?

207
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,000
You can't stay out of trouble.
I'll wait for you at the pond!

208
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,360
Coward!

209
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm frightened,
someone may find us here.

210
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Don't leave,
I want to stay here with you.

211
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,040
That was just a cow,

212
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,840
you were afraid for nothing.

213
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,120
You were afraid too.

214
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,120
I love you.

215
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,560
I love you, too.

216
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,640
Really?

217
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,240
But of course.

218
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,680
Thank you.

219
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,240
Stay a while!

220
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,400
I can't,
Nopoko is waiting.

221
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Later, then.

222
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,120
Don't come closer!

223
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Turn around!

224
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,000
One, two,

225
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,560
three, four,

226
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
five, six,

227
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,640
seven, eight,

228
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,040
nine, ten.

229
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,720
Can I come now?

230
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,760
No!

231
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,160
Tease!

232
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,000
One, two, three, four, five.

233
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,720
You can come now.

234
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,400
You'll get yours one day.

235
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,040
I didn't know
you loved me that much.

236
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Stop talking nonsense,

237
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,440
little fool!

238
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I'll never play with you again!

239
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,040
Go on ahead, I'll catch up with you.

240
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,360
One day, walking past here,

241
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,840
father and I saw a huge rabbit.

242
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,160
But by the time we
strung an arrow, it fled.

243
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Stop telling lies...

244
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,800
They're challenging us,

245
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,520
let's run!

246
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,320
lt won't do us any good.

247
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,360
I'm going to fight them.

248
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,680
Bastards!

249
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,960
Why don't you get lost!

250
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,440
Pig!
Give up or I'll kill you.

251
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,520
Bastards, sons of bitches!

252
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,040
Are you hurt?

253
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,080
Wipe away your tears.

254
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,040
You're nothing but trouble.

255
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,160
My problems have only begun.

256
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,680
Let me see.

257
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,800
I've been to the market...

258
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,600
and I've drank a great deal,

259
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,880
I'm high, I'm happy, I've had a great meal.

260
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,480
You make a horrible wife,

261
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,640
get out... and your kids too.

262
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,440
Here's your stuff!
All of you, get out!

263
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,400
You're throwing me out?

264
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,640
Yes, I don't want to see you!

265
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,920
I've warned you before.

266
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll go, but one day
you'll beg me to come back!

267
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,520
Get out of my sight!

268
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,360
Forgive them!

269
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,040
No, I refuse.

270
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,880
That bitch has poisoned
the children with her filthy ways.

271
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,200
I want them to go!

272
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,000
This is all your fault.

273
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,240
Leave him alone.

274
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,480
Does this concern you?

275
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,680
Are you in pain?

276
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,760
No!

277
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,680
Tell me the truth,
Sana is worried about you.

278
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,520
I'm telling you,
I'm not in pain.

279
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,760
Look at that...

280
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,480
She got exactly what she deserved.

281
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,320
Leave me be,
you deserve the same thing.

282
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,160
You're always mean to me.

283
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,880
Come here!
– Leave me alone!

284
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,680
Alcoholic during the day
and impotent at night!

285
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,400
Why are they behaving like that?

286
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,680
I don't know
but it's a shame.

287
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,560
It is...

288
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,080
What are you doing there?

289
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,360
We wanted to keep you company.

290
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
You could drink a little less.

291
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,400
I know this man,
he's a charlatan.

292
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,720
I found him once with Noaga's wife.

293
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,440
Wait here!

294
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,600
What are you going to do?

295
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,800
Don't worry about it.

296
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,880
Give to a blind man...

297
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,440
Give me my money!

298
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,920
He's not blind!

299
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,520
Catch him!

300
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,840
You see, I was right.

301
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,560
What's the matter with you?

302
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,200
I don't know...

303
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,680
My head hurts and I feel dizzy.

304
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,400
Let's go back to the village.

305
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,840
Mother,

306
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,920
she has tetanus,

307
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,400
Sana told me.

308
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,520
Don't worry. It's malaria
and she'll be better soon.

309
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,800
Your wife died a long time ago

310
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,760
and Nopoko needs a mother,

311
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,080
and Tenga's daughter would be perfect.

312
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,880
You're right,
but I'll have to think about it.

313
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
Uncle!

314
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,440
What do you want?

315
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
Nothing.

316
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,720
He can be very strange.

317
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,680
I agree with you.

318
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,800
It's Nopoko...

319
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,640
she is very sick,

320
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,080
but no one believes
that it's because of the knife.

321
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,880
Will you help us?

322
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,240
No, I can't.

323
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,320
I will help you.

324
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,320
Thank you. See you soon.

325
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,000
See you soon.

326
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,200
The sick girl is in the village.

327
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,600
Come!

328
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,360
No. The work will be done here.

329
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,920
-We've brought a cock!
-Get it!

330
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,920
Here's the cock!

331
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,560
There's nothing wrong with your child,

332
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,280
someone has stolen her soul.

333
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,600
I see an old, old woman...

334
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,640
it's a witch.

335
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,160
I told you!

336
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,400
You must drive her from the village

337
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,360
but sacrifices must be performed!

338
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,000
A bull,

339
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,320
a lamb, fifty coins.

340
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,600
Liar!

341
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,400
I know who he is.

342
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,800
He just wants to swindle you.

343
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,480
That's enough, drunkard!

344
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,160
Then it will be your problem.

345
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,520
Thank you for your help.

346
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,240
The old woman will be chased from the village.

347
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,640
I will wait for you this evening.

348
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,120
At sunset.

349
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,400
We will be there.

350
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,000
Let's go!

351
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,560
Witch, give us the child!

352
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,520
Let me do it!

353
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,440
Bila, come out of there!

354
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,440
He isn't inside.

355
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,080
Look!

356
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,120
Now she has no home!
– It's just as well.

357
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,160
You no longer have a home,

358
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,440
but one day, I'll build you one!

359
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,680
Let me have a drink.

360
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,800
You!

361
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,000
Where are you going?

362
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,320
We're going home!

363
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,160
Go away!

364
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,320
There's the child.

365
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,000
Bila,

366
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,720
come here!

367
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,360
Is she going to be okay ?

368
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,800
Here!

369
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,400
Tibo,

370
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,000
I'm afraid that all is lost.

371
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,120
Have courage.

372
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,280
Yaaba, greetings.

373
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,400
Old man, welcome.

374
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,720
He is a cousin of the sick girl.

375
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,240
A pleasure!

376
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,320
Let's go!

377
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,680
Father, this man can help us.

378
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,360
Idiot,

379
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,720
be quiet!

380
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,880
And you, where are you from?

381
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,840
That doesn't matter,
I come as a friend.

382
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,360
Liar!

383
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,640
The witch has sent you to
finish what she started,

384
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,720
but I'm not going to let you do that!

385
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,640
As you wish.

386
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,680
You are fools!

387
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,480
I know that man,

388
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,600
it's Taryam the great healer!
He could have helped you.

389
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,720
Filthy drunk!

390
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,040
You'll regret it.

391
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,480
Let's go find other medicines.

392
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,320
Come here!

393
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,440
I heard everything.
Your father and Tibo are wrong.

394
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:50,640
Find Taryam and bring his medicine, go!

395
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,600
Yaaba...

396
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,480
Taryam...

397
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,720
It is all going to work out.

398
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,200
Mother would like to try the medicine.

399
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,520
Is that true?

400
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,480
Then take this!

401
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,080
Good luck.

402
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Sana,

403
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,880
I have to go.

404
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,840
Good bye.

405
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,840
Thank you very much.

406
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,480
I'm going as well.

407
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,720
May the gods favour you.

408
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,400
Nopoko, drink this.

409
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,200
Drink!

410
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
No!

411
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,520
If you refuse,
you won't get better.

412
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,680
Drink it!

413
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,680
Father, wait for me!

414
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,200
Where is your mother?

415
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,600
At a baptism.

416
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,120
We'll go there, too!

417
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,760
Nopoko!

418
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,200
Nopoko, they've left, come out.

419
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,480
Wake up!

420
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,760
I'm speaking to you!

421
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,240
Wait,

422
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,360
I tricked you.

423
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,240
Here.

424
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,880
I don't want any,
I already had some this morning.

425
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,880
Silly, that's no reason
to not have a drink.

426
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,520
Take it!

427
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,920
Have some yourself.

428
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,240
No. I'm not the one that's sick.

429
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,360
You know,

430
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,440
we all thought that you were going to die,

431
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,760
but thanks to Taryam and Sana
you're going to be alright.

432
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,280
When you're feeling stronger
we'll go and see Sana. Alright?

433
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,600
Alright.

434
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,760
Now then, let me massage you.

435
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,480
Liar, he'll have your hide!

436
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,080
That man is a charlatan!

437
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,160
He's the one that burned your hut!

438
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,600
He promised a king he would turn
cow shit into silver.

439
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,280
Tibo is going to get married.

440
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,440
There's his bride.

441
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,240
I know her well,
she's a good woman.

442
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,760
She's not like my wife Pegda.

443
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,520
No, that one's a bitch!

444
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,440
Long live Tibo and his wife!

445
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,120
Look at Koudi!

446
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,880
What she's doing is wrong.

447
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,440
Don't judge her,
she may have her reasons.

448
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,040
Let's go.

449
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,320
Do you think they've seen us?

450
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,480
I don't think so.

451
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,160
But sooner or later
everyone will know.

452
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,240
Come on!

453
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,520
Ah, that's life!

454
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,480
More.

455
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,880
Let's really do it!

456
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,560
Let's get going.

457
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,320
Was that nice?

458
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,920
Don't you know?

459
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,120
Yes, but I want to hear you say it.

460
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,560
Razougou, look!

461
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,920
Go away, drunkard!

462
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,840
We'll settle our business after!

463
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,920
This is all your fault,

464
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,320
I will never be forced to live with you again.

465
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,240
Idiot!

466
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,320
Alcoholic!

467
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,600
I will go with Razougou.

468
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,200
Impotent fool!
I don't care if everyone knows it!

469
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,280
Bila, bring the old woman
something to eat.

470
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,400
Where are you going?

471
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,320
He's bringing the old
woman some food.

472
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,840
I can't feed her as well.

473
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,080
This is the last time, okay?

474
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,840
Bila, go on your way.

475
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,720
Old hen!

476
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,560
The gods saved Nopoko, not that witch.

477
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,480
If something should happen to Bila,
it will be thanks to you.

478
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,560
I will change you yet.

479
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,520
Where is Koudi going?

480
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,840
Probably to join Razougou.

481
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,240
The tramp!

482
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,040
Don't judge her.
She has her reasons.

483
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,840
Vultures...

484
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,840
I don't like that at all.

485
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,480
Me neither.

486
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,240
Let's go.

487
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,040
We've brought you something to eat!

488
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,880
She seems to be sleeping.

489
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,480
Wake her up.

490
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,200
Let's go home.

491
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,080
Come on.

492
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,640
You promised, you'd
tell me about Yaaba.

493
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:06,920
Yaaba never knew her parents.

494
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,360
Her mother died giving birth

495
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,200
and her father died of grief.

496
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,480
And that's why they called her a witch?

497
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,480
That's the only reason.

498
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,240
I know that story.

499
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,120
Yaaba told it to me.

500
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,360
And you said nothing to me.
Some cousin, I'll never speak to you again!

501
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,680
I'm sorry.

502
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,360
That means nothing!

503
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,400
Here then,

504
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,120
it's a keepsake of Sana

505
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,360
and it's very dear to me.

506
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,520
I will never lose it.

507
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,280
If you can catch me, I'll give it back.

508
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,520
Count to ten.

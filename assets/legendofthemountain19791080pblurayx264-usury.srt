00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,553
<i>In the olden days,</i>

16
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:25,933
<i>there were a lot of Chinese legends.</i>

17
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,979
<i>Some are about spirits and monks,</i>

18
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,482
<i>while others are about
ghosts and fairies.</i>

19
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:41,407
<i>These legends were popular
with all audiences.</i>

20
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,452
<i>One of the legends</i>

21
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,957
<i>is set in the Song dynasty,</i>

22
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:55,838
<i>maybe in the 11th century.</i>

23
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>A scholar failed the imperial exam.</i>

24
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,927
<i>All he knew how to do was study,</i>

25
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,764
<i>but he couldn't find a decent job,</i>

26
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,602
<i>so he started working as a copyist.</i>

27
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,105
<i>It was a living.</i>

28
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,317
<i>One day he got a letter</i>

29
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,237
<i>from a monk at the Ocean Mudra Temple</i>

30
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,949
<i>asking him to copy a Buddhist sutra.</i>

31
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,620
<i>Well, he wasn't a Buddhist,</i>

32
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,498
<i>nor did he believe in a spirit world.</i>

33
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,793
<i>But then he thought it over</i>

34
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,672
<i>and could hardly say no to the money.</i>

35
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,383
<i>It was merely another job, after all.</i>

36
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,651
OCEAN MUDRA TEMPLE AT GAYA MOUNTAIN

37
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,155
Wait here for the sutra and the prayer beads.

38
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,865
What about the mudra?

39
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,494
The old master will show you.
Remember not to speak.

40
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,579
Just listen to what he says.

41
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,997
Yes, of course.

42
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,213
So later...

43
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,548
Will you...?

44
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,217
Me? I'm not allowed to go in.

45
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,404
Master Pujing in the capital
needs this sutra for a ritual.

46
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,822
I see.

47
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,577
It's a ritual to release lost souls
who died on the frontier.

48
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,454
It will be a great meritorious act.

49
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,414
So copy the sutra as fast as you can.

50
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,666
I shall.

51
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,002
I've found you a quiet place to copy it.

52
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,129
This is a letter of introduction.

53
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,048
Tsui Hung-chih?

54
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,841
Tsui is an adviser to General Han.

55
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,302
I haven't seen him in over a year.

56
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:17,224
Here's a money order
to cover your expenses.

57
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,813
What's Mr Tsui like?

58
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,232
He's a good friend of mine.

59
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,734
He's mild-mannered, widely read,

60
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,570
but uninterested in an official career.

61
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,489
His current position is a sinecure,

62
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,491
so he doesn't have much to do.

63
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,828
He spends his days enjoying
wine, poetry and nature.

64
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,955
Mr Tsui and I are birds of a feather.

65
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,873
Just make sure to keep yourself in line:

66
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,252
spending too much time in
nature will delay the work.

67
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,129
Don't worry.

68
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,858
Sir.

69
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,236
Where is Qinfeng Road?

70
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,738
Go through the gate, go straight,

71
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,239
cross the bridge and turn left.

72
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,908
Thanks.

73
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,147
BAMBOO ISLAND PAVILION

74
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,574
Sir, I hope you don't mind my asking,
but how do I get to North Fort?

75
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,794
How far is it?

76
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,671
Why do you want to go there?

77
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,631
To see a friend.

78
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,842
You'd better not go.

79
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,303
Why not?

80
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,390
Nobody lives there.

81
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,102
Great, I'm looking for peace and quiet.

82
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,063
How do I get there?

83
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,568
Go downhill and cross the river.

84
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,113
There's no bridge, but it's not deep.

85
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,615
You can cross on the rocks.

86
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,521
Sir.

87
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,485
Sir, wait!

88
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,196
I have a question.

89
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,459
Sir, wait!

90
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,752
I'd like to ask you...

91
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,003
Be careful.

92
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,755
Sir!

93
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,800
What are you doing?

94
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,429
Stop it.

95
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,982
Old Chang, let him go!

96
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,735
What's gotten into you?

97
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,490
Be gone.

98
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,867
Leave!

99
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,517
Sorry, my old subordinate is deranged.

100
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,020
If he has offended you,
please accept my apology.

101
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,189
No, it's my fault.

102
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:08,025
I kept pestering him,
hoping to ask for directions.

103
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,237
He probably thought
I was up to no good.

104
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,947
No, that's not it.

105
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,117
He gets confused when he sees strangers.

106
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,494
Maybe you can tell me the way.

107
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,164
How do I get to the General's Mansion
on Qinfeng Road?

108
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,667
It's right up ahead.

109
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,169
I'll take you.

110
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,337
Great! Please.

111
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,631
- Let me show you the way.
- Thank you.

112
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,473
This way.

113
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,908
I've got something else to ask you.

114
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,493
Oh, I'm no expert.

115
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:04,248
The road's been so desolate since the pass.

116
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:08,669
I didn't see any soldiers in the fort.
Did they transfer somewhere else?

117
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,172
The rest transferred back.

118
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,923
- The rest?
- Yes.

119
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,553
There were only a few left.

120
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,473
Did they lose control of the area?

121
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,517
You don't know what happened here.

122
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,770
I heard there was a conflict.

123
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,065
We battled Xixia bitterly
for three years,

124
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,360
but the imperial court was irresolute.

125
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:36,238
The Xixia king saw a weakness,
and launched a massive assault.

126
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,784
Almost all our soldiers were slaughtered.

127
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,120
The court signed a humiliating treaty,

128
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:46,082
so that neither side can station troops.

129
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,668
The area is now a no man's land.

130
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,049
Then what happened to General Han?

131
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,759
He died defending his country.

132
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:57,885
He's dead?

133
00:27:58,302 --> 00:27:59,011
Oh no!

134
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,431
What, did you know him?

135
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,849
No, I didn't.

136
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,860
I want to ask you about someone.

137
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:15,861
Who?

138
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,698
One of his advisers, a Mr Tsui.

139
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,368
I am Tsui Hung-chih.

140
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,286
What a coincidence!

141
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,331
Huiming at Ocean Mudra Temple
sent me with a letter for you.

142
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,125
Sorry.

143
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,627
Here it is.

144
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,640
Oh! Mr Ho.

145
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,309
You're here to find a quiet place
so you can copy a sutra.

146
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,270
Yes, but given the situation here,

147
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,147
I don't know if it's convenient or not.

148
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,232
No inconvenience at all.

149
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,613
It's quiet here if nothing else.

150
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:03,284
I left my pack in the pavilion.

151
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,828
I'll tell Old Chang to get it for you.

152
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,079
Old Chang?

153
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,373
That man just now.

154
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:29,935
GENERAL HAN'S MANSION, QINFENG ROAD

155
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,697
So this is the General's Mansion.

156
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,620
- Mr Ho, let's go inside.
- Yes.

157
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:02,092
This is where General Han gave orders
and reviewed the troops of his armies.

158
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,323
In his letter Huiming said
you're going to copy a sutra.

159
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,826
Which sutra are you going to copy?

160
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,536
The Great Mudra Sutra.

161
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,372
Has it been translated?

162
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,792
Yes, it took Master Fayuan
ten years to translate.

163
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:40,089
I heard whoever owns this esoteric sutra

164
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,049
can navigate the realms of life and death.

165
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,676
I don't know too much about it.

166
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,554
Monk Huiming said, of all the sutras from India,

167
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:49,515
only it can grant release to lost souls.

168
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,602
I hear the hardest part is the mudra.

169
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,855
I know a thing or two about it.

170
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,982
- How reassuring!
- Why?

171
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,694
To think that lost souls can get
release from suffering.

172
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,699
Mr Tsui, do you believe in all this?

173
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,826
I believe. What about you?

174
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,661
I didn't used to believe.

175
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,162
But now more and more I do.

176
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,247
Why?

177
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,165
I've seen so many strange things lately.

178
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,125
Really?

179
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,294
I'll tell you some other time.

180
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,297
Mr Ho, about the mudras...

181
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,216
Did Master Fayuan pass them
on to you personally?

182
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,679
Yes, when I got there,
the venerable sir taught them to me,

183
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,307
especially the art of subduing demons.

184
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,686
He worried demons might harass me on the way.

185
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,856
But I don't know if it really works.

186
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,483
Mr Ho, after you.

187
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,985
Thanks.

188
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,530
It will work if your heart is true.

189
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,241
- Good point!
- Please.

190
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,162
Here it is.

191
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,540
- It's fairly plain.
- No, it's perfect.

192
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,544
Once the abode of
the General's favourite concubine,

193
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,380
it's now a guest house.

194
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,591
Make yourself at home.

195
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,350
This is the bedroom.

196
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,146
You'll find everything you need.

197
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,774
If you need anything else let me know.

198
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,484
No, I'll be fine.

199
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,570
It's really comfortable and quiet.

200
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,491
It may be, but you have to be careful.

201
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,535
What you mean? It's not safe here?

202
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:37,414
You won't get robbed,

203
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,167
but I'm worried about the sutra.

204
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,460
Really?

205
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,215
This is a gazebo.

206
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,469
And there's a lotus pond over there.

207
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,847
Wonderful.

208
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,393
You said you're worried about the sutra?

209
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:01,647
I heard that if
evil sorcerers got hold of it,

210
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,692
they could enslave fiends and do evil.

211
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,277
Does the sutra really have such power?

212
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,197
So I hear.

213
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,117
Better safe than sorry.

214
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,703
I think it would be safest

215
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,706
not to tell anyone you're copying the sutra.

216
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,916
One more thing:

217
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,002
I'll tell Old Chang

218
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,379
to bring your meals every day

219
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,215
and take care of your laundry.

220
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,634
Old Chang? I can cook my own meals.

221
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,720
And I always wash my own clothes.

222
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,514
Don't worry about such trivialities.

223
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,849
Really, it's fine.

224
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,267
There's no need to trouble Old Chang.

225
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,520
Mr Tsui, Mr Tsui...

226
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,065
Oh no! That old lady
is rather trying.

227
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,191
You are really something.

228
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:49,737
Old Chang is useless, too clumsy.
How can he serve anyone?

229
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,865
Madame Wang, what are you doing here?

230
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,993
I heard Old Chang say you have a guest.

231
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,786
I knew he'd be staying here.

232
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,581
Mr Tsui, when will you introduce me?

233
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,957
This is Madame Wang,

234
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,043
General Han's chief housekeeper.

235
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,335
And this is Mr Ho.

236
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,462
Hello Madame Wang.

237
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,047
Let's talk inside.

238
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,716
Mr Ho, cooking and cleaning
is for old ladies.

239
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,092
You leave everything to me.

240
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,677
Mr Tsui, Old Chang's not up to it.

241
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,637
He's deaf and mute, and inefficient.

242
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,639
Put it here, Old Chang.

243
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,436
Madame Wang, how could we impose on...

244
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,313
Don't treat me like a stranger.

245
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,565
Mr Ho, is there any laundry in here?

246
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,567
I will wash it while I am at it.

247
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:29,985
No, I don't have any laundry.

248
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,029
All I carry in my pack is books.

249
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,366
Don't be afraid to ask for help.

250
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,410
I know how hard it is
to be away from home.

251
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,621
Old Chang, take his pack into the room.

252
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,122
Madame Wang,
please don't go to the trouble of...

253
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,957
Don't interrupt me while I'm working.

254
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,834
Mr Ho, I'll tell you the truth,

255
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,419
I'm bored out of my skull.

256
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,213
Don't worry, I don't want your money.

257
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,256
I can take it myself.

258
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,218
I don't want to impose.

259
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,845
I've got an idea: I have a child.

260
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,181
You teach my child for free,

261
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,850
and I will cook and clean for you.

262
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,894
Is it a deal? What do you say?

263
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,020
Well, I...

264
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,021
Madame Wang,

265
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,815
Mr Ho has a lot of things to do.

266
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,859
Tutoring won't take much of my time.

267
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,361
Good, it's a deal!

268
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,987
Mr Ho, you must be tired.

269
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,031
Mr Tsui, let's go.

270
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,951
Madame Wang, I'm going to
invite Mr Ho to dinner.

271
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,494
You go first.

272
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,996
Right! Tonight I'll make a few dishes

273
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,207
to welcome Mr Ho here on your behalf.

274
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,043
- No...
- Let's go, I don't want to hear it.

275
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,670
Mr Ho's been on the road for days.

276
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,380
At least let him take a nap.

277
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,799
Let's go! Old Chang...

278
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,843
Let me go!

279
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,638
This evening I'll send someone for you.

280
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,598
Mr Tsui, let's go to the market.

281
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:42,766
To the market?

282
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,686
- Mr Tsui...
- We'd better just go along with her.

283
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,354
- No need to send me off.
- Bye.

284
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,564
Old Chang, let's go.

285
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,648
See you later.

286
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,067
All right, see you later.
Thanks in advance.

287
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,319
Thanks for what? See you this evening.

288
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,696
See you this evening.

289
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,947
All right.

290
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,074
Quiet now. Let's go.

291
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,127
What?

292
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,214
Old Chang!

293
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,777
Mr Ho.

294
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,282
Mr Ho, the person I'll send
is my maid, Qing.

295
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,909
All right.

296
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:45,078
Mr Ho, remember, don't be late.

297
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,205
All right, thanks.

298
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,298
Who is it?

299
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,507
Me.

300
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,720
Madame Wang sent me to escort you.

301
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,224
Please come in.

302
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:26,865
You are?

303
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,284
I'm Qing, Madame Wang's maid.

304
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,244
Great, let's go.

305
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:05,445
Were you scared to come alone just now?

306
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,658
I hear this area is haunted.

307
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,898
Look! Over there!

308
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,610
What is it?

309
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,828
Don't be afraid.

310
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,876
It's just a Lama. Let's go.

311
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,892
Hurry up.

312
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,314
Here we are.

313
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,669
I'm coming.

314
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:45,879
- Mr Ho, you're here.
- Madame.

315
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,089
- Please come in.
- All right.

316
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,509
- Mr Ho, over here.
- All right.

317
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,347
Sit inside.

318
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,599
- You made it!
- Mr Tsui.

319
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:58,517
Please sit down.

320
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,726
You two!

321
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,520
- I'll do what you say then.
- Sit yourself down!

322
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,355
- Sit down, you two...
- All right.

323
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,065
- Sit...
- After you.

324
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,236
I'm grateful to you both
for your hospitality.

325
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,820
- Sorry for all the trouble.
- Here we go again.

326
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,531
Mr Tsui and I want to welcome you.

327
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,032
Make yourself at home.

328
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,701
With Madame's delicious wine,
a toast to you.

329
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,119
Thanks.

330
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,455
- A toast to you too.
- All right.

331
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,417
Good wine.

332
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:25,544
To be honest,

333
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:27,963
I brewed this herbal wine myself
over ten years ago.

334
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,131
- No wonder.
- Here it comes.

335
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,759
The hot pot is served.

336
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:34,761
What an amazing meal!

337
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,264
Just simple country dishes.

338
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,432
Madame Wang is famous for her cooking.

339
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,809
If it weren't for you,

340
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,060
I wouldn't be here to enjoy it.

341
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,562
Just listen to yourself!

342
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,648
Yunqing, there's no
such thing as a free meal.

343
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,816
Really?

344
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,568
Why do you say that?

345
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:52,195
Mr Ho, didn't I mention

346
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,823
I don't want my child
sitting around all day.

347
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,533
I want to hire a tutor.

348
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,034
If you're not too busy,

349
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,911
then why don't you take a pupil?

350
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:01,580
I don't have what it takes.

351
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,957
Mr Ho, don't belittle yourself.

352
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,672
Yes, Yunqing, don't put yourself down.

353
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,132
Just see if you have the time...

354
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,843
I have the time, but I've never...

355
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:15,802
Mr Ho,

356
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,262
You can be straight with me.

357
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,139
Just name your tutoring fee.

358
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,307
No,

359
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,641
that's not what I meant.

360
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:22,851
I've never been a tutor.

361
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:23,935
I'm afraid I'll do a bad job.

362
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,229
You learn by doing.

363
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:28,857
My child isn't slow,
just a bit naughty.

364
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,025
Naughty is normal.

365
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,985
Children will be children.
But has he been taught before?

366
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,280
For a couple of years.
The zither, chess, poetry, and painting.

367
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,365
How old is your son?

368
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,826
My son? Oh, here she is.

369
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,996
All grown up!

370
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,999
That's her.

371
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,126
This is that child of mine.

372
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,670
Please sit down.

373
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:53,173
Come over.

374
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,759
All grown up and still so shy?

375
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,177
Meet Mr Ho.

376
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,638
- Yes.
- Go over.

377
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,184
Come, sit by Mr Ho.

378
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,977
Mr Ho, her name is Melody.

379
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,354
We've already talked it over.

380
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,230
Mr Ho will be your tutor.

381
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,815
Madame Wang, this will not do.

382
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:11,941
I didn't know you meant a girl.

383
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,110
Mr Ho, you can't go back on your word.

384
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,571
Come, bow to your teacher.

385
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,406
Sir.

386
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,366
I'm not a teacher!

387
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,284
Mr Ho, please sit down.

388
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,495
Clumsy girl! You splashed the wine.

389
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,789
No, it's my fault.

390
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,667
Young lady, get up.

391
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,252
- I don't deserve it.
- Quick, wipe the wine off.

392
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:32,796
- No!
- I'm sorry, sir!

393
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:33,880
It was my fault.

394
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:34,964
Refill Mr Ho's cup.

395
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,132
I'm fine, no need.

396
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,884
She's kowtowed to you,
so you must take her as your pupil.

397
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,386
Mr Tsui, am I right?

398
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,637
Mr Tsui...

399
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,016
You'll have to make the best of it.

400
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,814
It'd be inappropriate to teach a girl.

401
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,357
But we can study together...

402
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,693
Study what together?
She'll take lessons from you.

403
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:55,735
Madame Wang...

404
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:57,070
Mr Ho, you've agreed.

405
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,863
- Hurry up and toast your teacher.
- I...

406
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:01,324
Mr Ho, a toast to you.

407
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,492
All right.

408
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,870
Then it's settled.

409
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,206
All right, Yunqing.

410
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,083
Now you've got a beautiful disciple.

411
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,043
Come, a toast to you.

412
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,628
- I shouldn't drink.
- Melody, refill Mr Ho's cup.

413
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,921
All right, thank you.

414
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,048
Yunqing, Melody is a good student,

415
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:18,508
and a talented musician.

416
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,301
She plays lots of different instruments,

417
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,929
and excels in percussion.

418
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,432
- Uncle Tsui!
- Then you should teach me instead.

419
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,600
- Mr Ho, you're not serious!
- I mean it.

420
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:29,853
Don't listen to Uncle Tsui,
I don't deserve his praise.

421
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,771
- Drink some more!
- I don't hold my liquor well.

422
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,273
You've barely drunk anything.

423
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,315
Come.

424
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:35,900
Very well.

425
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,610
Please.

426
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:39,863
Madame! Miss!

427
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,781
You won't believe it.
Come quickly!

428
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,201
What are you making such a fuss over?
Come here.

429
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:48,496
You keep drinking.

430
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,915
There is a Lama begging for alms.
I'll take a look.

431
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,835
What's the matter?

432
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,296
Lamas often come begging for alms.

433
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,757
<i>Amitabha Buddha!</i>

434
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,341
<i>What do you want?</i>

435
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,635
<i>We don't give out alms here.</i>

436
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:03,845
<i>Get out!</i>

437
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,847
Mother has a bad temper,
I'll go and see.

438
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,682
All right, go ahead.

439
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,227
<i>Do you hear me? Get out!</i>

440
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,898
Yunqing, a toast.

441
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,733
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

442
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,613
You just said Lamas often come here.

443
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,864
I'm going to see for myself.

444
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,491
No need, Yunqing.

445
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:25,867
No, on the way here,

446
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,327
I was followed by a Lama.

447
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,037
He did not look friendly.

448
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,622
I will go and see if it is him.

449
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,624
<i>Are you looking for trouble?</i>

450
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,335
Why are you being difficult?

451
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,337
I think it's him. I'll go for a closer look.

452
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,006
No need, Madame Wang can handle him.

453
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,674
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

454
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,635
Leave!

455
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,724
Go!

456
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:51,851
Away with you!

457
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,022
Next time, don't make a fuss.
Shut the door!

458
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,278
Now let's all sit down again.

459
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:08,034
Sir, I hope it hasn't ruined your evening.

460
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,160
What just happened?

461
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,745
That Lama was probably drunk.

462
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,039
He insisted on coming in for a drink.

463
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,457
What nerve!

464
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:15,917
Yes, sit.

465
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,293
Please.

466
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:20,672
Mr Tsui, just now...

467
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,714
- Another drink.
- I can't.

468
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:22,882
Since...

469
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:24,592
Uncle Tsui just praised my drumming,

470
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:27,929
let me perform to the best of my ability
to entertain both of you.

471
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,973
- All right.
- Wonderful!

472
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,347
Not bad.

473
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:59,354
Mr Tsui, look.

474
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,191
It's Old Chang.

475
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,859
Old Chang, you've come just in time.

476
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,569
There is a Lama outside making trouble.

477
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,363
Go and get rid of him.

478
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,700
- Please sit over there.
- Mother's over there, go quickly.

479
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:46,401
Yunqing, have another drink.

480
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:57,388
- Yunqing...
- Uncle Tsui!

481
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,515
Let Mr Ho enjoy himself.

482
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:10,860
Very... good... wine...

483
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,598
The Lama's here.

484
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,051
You're awake?

485
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,310
I'll pour you a cup of tea.

486
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,812
Please don't bother.

487
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,698
Miss, when did you come?

488
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,326
Me? I brought you back with Old Chang.

489
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,036
Thank you...

490
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,079
I'm really sorry.

491
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,332
Sorry?

492
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,336
You said I had to take you home,

493
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,254
or you wouldn't leave.

494
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,465
Did I say that?

495
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:43,304
I was really drunk last night.

496
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,784
Then... after you brought me back...

497
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,285
So you did spent the night here...

498
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:35,982
What happened last night?

499
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,067
Ask yourself.

500
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,612
Ask myself? Miss...

501
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:45,658
Please don't call me "Miss".

502
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:49,370
All right... then...

503
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,807
Mi...

504
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,183
Melody.

505
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:18,107
Did you sleep here last night?

506
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,360
Were you really drunk last night?
Or just pretending?

507
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:26,115
I think I was really drunk.

508
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,621
What about everything that happened?

509
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,458
You don't remember anything?

510
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,258
I don't remember a thing.

511
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,679
Maybe you're forgetting on purpose.

512
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,431
Me?

513
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,352
Oh, I see, you regret what happened.

514
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,523
You men are always playing around.

515
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,609
It doesn't mean a thing to you.

516
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,986
Melody, you...

517
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:08,532
Fatherless girls and widows
are easy to take advantage of.

518
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,453
What are you talking about?

519
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,249
Should I tell you everything?

520
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,085
Yes...

521
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:23,130
I told you everything last night.

522
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:27,134
Having been sold to General Han
to be an entertainer,

523
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:30,679
I'm like used goods,
not worthy of your love.

524
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,433
But last night you pledged
to spend your life with me.

525
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:38,062
I pledged to spend my life with you?

526
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,483
So I gave you my body,

527
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,818
not realising...

528
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,988
...everything you said was facetious.

529
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,366
How could this be a laughing matter?

530
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,243
Melody, listen to me...

531
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,452
Mr Ho.

532
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,123
Karma arranged for us to meet!
At least we had last night!

533
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,582
Goodbye!

534
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,334
Melody!

535
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,586
Don't worry, I won't cling to you.

536
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,088
Melody!

537
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:07,758
Melody, listen to me.

538
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:08,843
What?

539
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,469
How could I be that kind of man?

540
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,555
What kind of man are you then?

541
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,974
Melody, if what you said was true,

542
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,267
I'd be afraid I don't deserve you.

543
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,726
You mean I was lying?

544
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,272
Of course not, I just never thought
I could win you over.

545
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,690
You already got what you wanted.

546
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,650
I...

547
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:31,907
These pills will ease your hangover.
Take one when you get a headache.

548
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,416
And this is the pledge of your love,

549
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:42,501
which I am now returning to you.

550
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,338
I'm not a heartless man.

551
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:52,261
But... I still don't get it.

552
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:57,099
Last night, right here,

553
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,894
you played the flute, I the drums,

554
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,146
and you whispered sweet nothings.

555
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,482
Was it the wine talking?

556
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,611
I'll marry you, no matter what.

557
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:09,945
I...

558
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:16,202
But there's something
I'm too embarrassed to mention.

559
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,245
Embarrassed?

560
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,455
I can't tell you what it is yet.

561
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:20,998
What's so embarrassing?

562
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,167
Yes, what's so embarrassing? Let's talk it over.

563
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,085
- Madame Wang.
- Mother.

564
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,212
Mr Tsui.

565
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,213
You rotten girl.

566
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:29,048
How can you get engaged
without letting me know?

567
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,509
Cavorting in broad daylight! Shameless!

568
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:34,136
- Mother!
- Ah... I...

569
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,805
Don't worry, she won't run away.

570
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,226
I will wait for you at the lotus pond.

571
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,185
But later...

572
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:41,977
All right.

573
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,772
It's been only two days,
and you're stuck together like honey.

574
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,899
- Sit down.
- No, I'm afraid she...

575
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:47,942
What are you afraid of?

576
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,568
If you're already hen-pecked now,

577
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,986
what will you do after getting married?

578
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,863
Sit, we have something to discuss.

579
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,490
- Please sit.
- All right.

580
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,911
- Last night, you proposed.
- I proposed what?

581
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,205
You said you and Melody were meant to meet.

582
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,124
It was love at first sight,
and you had to marry her.

583
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,294
Mr Tsui, did I say so?

584
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,588
Listen to Madame Wang.

585
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,260
Did you mention something embarrassing?

586
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,595
I... Oh, that...

587
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,305
You are my future son-in-law.

588
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,890
Your business is my business.

589
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:21,141
Tell me.

590
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,726
I...

591
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:27,022
Mr Tsui, it's hard to say.

592
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:30,025
Just say it.

593
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:35,906
All right, Mr Tsui, to tell the truth,

594
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,910
I'm just a free-spirited wanderer,

595
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:44,873
and I've never been more
impecunious than I am now.

596
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,087
"Impecunious"?

597
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,881
Mr Ho means he is not a rich man.

598
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,593
Well, I wasn't expecting you to be rich.

599
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:56,969
What's embarrassing about that?

600
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,139
- The bridal gift? The wedding expenses?
- No need. It's her second marriage.

601
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,640
You have no friends or relations here.

602
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:02,975
We don't need a wedding.

603
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,352
All that matters is that you're in love.

604
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:07,187
Then what about the future?

605
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,565
To tell the truth,
she has some savings.

606
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,900
You won't have
anything to worry about.

607
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,529
Mr Tsui, is it really all right?

608
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:20,242
It's for the rest of your life.
You have to make up your own mind.

609
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,620
That goes without saying! He's already decided.

610
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,372
In that case you can be the matchmaker.

611
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,293
Right! The 5th is an auspicious day.

612
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,419
Madame Wang,

613
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,504
- 5th of next month it is!
- No, Madame Wang...

614
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:33,922
Come, I will take you to the lotus pond.

615
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:35,549
I have to discuss this with her...

616
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,301
Take your time.
Go and talk to her yourself.

617
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:38,761
- Mr Tsui, I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

618
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,928
What do you need
to talk to him about?

619
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,056
- We have to talk things over.
- No need for that.

620
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,474
Hurry.

621
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:49,063
Hurry up.

622
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,690
Get a move on.

623
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:54,777
Come.

624
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,660
Go.

625
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:04,453
Go!

626
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:55,879
Last night I was drunk and said things I...

627
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:14,388
Here are some medicinal fungi.
Two sets should be enough.

628
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,646
Give it to me.

629
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:25,899
Son-in-law.

630
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,402
Son-in-law, are you any better?

631
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,653
Mother.

632
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:32,906
I'm much better, but still a bit weak.

633
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,409
No problem, I've brought a tonic.

634
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,203
This one is really great.

635
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:47,295
What did you bring, Mother?

636
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,380
Turtle stew.

637
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:50,424
- It's restorative, if you drink it hot.
- Turtle stew?

638
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:51,466
Madame.

639
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,302
How many red dates
should I cook with the chicken?

640
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,179
Wait for me, I'm coming.

641
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:57,597
Oh, that maid of mine!

642
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:58,974
Come, drink it hot.

643
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:03,854
I'll fetch a ladle.

644
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:14,031
All right, I know.

645
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,407
Mother, what are you doing?

646
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:03,830
I am... taking the sutra to you.

647
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,540
To me?

648
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,125
As if I can't get it myself!

649
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,210
Leave it.

650
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,144
You are up to your old tricks.

651
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:32,359
I was going to get a monk to read it.

652
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,527
And then we could...

653
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,112
Stop dreaming!

654
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,905
That's not what I meant.

655
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,950
Melody, I'm afraid Tsui
will strike first.

656
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:40,951
Not to mention...

657
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,202
Listen to me!

658
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,454
The sutra is useless by itself.

659
01:08:44,538 --> 01:08:48,333
The sutra has to be copied,
and you need his amber beads,

660
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,377
and it has to be read 180 times.

661
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,878
So when will he finish copying it?

662
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,463
Don't you worry about that.

663
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:54,506
Don't move.

664
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,218
You rotten girl!

665
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,596
No more tricks.

666
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,687
- Melody...
- Mother!

667
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,939
- There's something I need you to do.
- What?

668
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,567
Keep your eye on that Lama.

669
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,943
All right.

670
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:50,770
Master, I can't discuss that sutra with you.

671
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,152
Reverend.

672
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:01,364
I can't do anything about Melody.

673
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,783
Reverend...

674
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:20,920
Reverend!

675
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,352
Well played.

676
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,031
All right, I lost.

677
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:19,664
Fine.

678
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:40,912
Master, don't bring trouble on yourself.

679
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,790
Yes, Reverend. You're right.

680
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,838
- Sit down.
- Yes.

681
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:06,099
I've still got two pages to do.

682
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:07,850
Tired?

683
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:09,310
I'm all right.

684
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:14,691
I'll make you ginseng stew.

685
01:18:14,816 --> 01:18:16,025
Thanks.

686
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:22,990
Melody.

687
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:24,909
Melody!

688
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,828
You won't believe it.

689
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,329
Just now I saw that Lama

690
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:30,331
studying drumming with your master.

691
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,541
Did they see you?

692
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:32,875
They caught me.

693
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,127
And the Lama told me to tell you

694
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,294
you are not to touch that sutra

695
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,964
or he will tell Mr Ho that you are...

696
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,007
He's here. What do we do?

697
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,301
It's all right, come with me.

698
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:56,733
Don't be afraid.

699
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,578
You and Qling go intercept the Lama.

700
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,538
Whatever you do, don't let him in.

701
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,248
- Do you know how to use these?
- I do.

702
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:13,624
Then go.

703
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,001
I...

704
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,871
Oh! You were playing your drum.

705
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,336
Listen.

706
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:47,093
Not bad at all!

707
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:49,679
In the rear garden, I think.

708
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,931
Oh, at the lotus pond.

709
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,724
The ginseng still needs to stew.

710
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:56,018
Let's go and join the drummer.

711
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:57,061
All right.

712
01:20:57,144 --> 01:20:58,646
Miss.

713
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:00,356
Miss, come here.

714
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,110
You go first.

715
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,444
All right.

716
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,409
What are you doing?

717
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,202
What a pain you are.

718
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:14,704
Put the spells up on the door.

719
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,706
Hurry up!

720
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:21,544
What's wrong?

721
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,296
Mr Tsui came this morning.

722
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:24,589
He wanted to take you to the market.

723
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,173
Really?

724
01:25:05,226 --> 01:25:07,853
<i>Om mani padme hum...</i>

725
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:10,958
<i>Om mani padme hum.</i>

726
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,608
Don't mind me.

727
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,020
What's that sound?

728
01:30:01,522 --> 01:30:03,607
Xixia soldiers are testing the cannons.

729
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,110
Oh...

730
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,156
How is my playing?

731
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:13,283
Wonderful.

732
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:14,535
Look!

733
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,246
Wow!

734
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:27,131
Let's go.

735
01:30:58,704 --> 01:31:00,747
They must have fired another shot.

736
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,091
Madame, Madame! They're coming.

737
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:16,597
They're all here.

738
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,225
They? My son-in-law too?

739
01:31:20,684 --> 01:31:21,518
Yes.

740
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,897
Don't forget to tell Melody about this.

741
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:27,024
Oh.

742
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:28,984
I'm coming.

743
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,571
Mr Ho, Mr Tsui.

744
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:34,323
Please.

745
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:40,787
Please.

746
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:42,164
Now you're my guest, you first.

747
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,332
Qing.

748
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:44,791
Where is the Madame?

749
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,960
The Madame... has taken ill.

750
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:54,176
- Madame Wang.
- Mother.

751
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:57,554
You're all here.

752
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,056
What's wrong with you?

753
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,017
I had another asthma attack.

754
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:06,897
- What's wrong?
- My eyelid's been twitching.

755
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,065
So I knew that you all would come.

756
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:09,691
- All your rules!
- Sit.

757
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:10,901
Shall we call the doctor?

758
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,903
- No!
- No need...

759
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,030
My mother has a ready made remedy.

760
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:18,534
Yes, it's ready made.

761
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:22,538
There's a late market today.

762
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:25,541
Yunqing and Uncle Tsui want
to buy copying supplies.

763
01:32:25,624 --> 01:32:27,209
I thought I'd drop in
to see how you're doing.

764
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,835
I didn't know you'd be sick.

765
01:32:28,919 --> 01:32:31,880
We don't have to rush to the market.
Let's stay here with Mother.

766
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,257
I am all right.

767
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,216
My things...

768
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:36,843
In that case
I'll stay with my mother.

769
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:39,263
You two go and buy supplies.

770
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:40,847
Mr Tsui, what do you say?

771
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:42,849
I'm all right either way.

772
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:47,646
But if we go the earlier the better.

773
01:32:48,105 --> 01:32:50,148
No, those things can wait.

774
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:52,192
I can buy them any time.

775
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:55,487
You almost finished copying.

776
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:56,530
You go home first.

777
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,824
I'll get Old Chang
to take me back in the morning.

778
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,867
- No.
- You go, first things first.

779
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:02,703
Yunqing, let's go,

780
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,454
or we won't make it in time.

781
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:05,497
Come with me.

782
01:33:05,581 --> 01:33:06,790
Mr Tsui...

783
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,333
Is it really all right?

784
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:09,418
What?

785
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:13,046
Go with him.

786
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:16,633
- All right, I'll pick you up tomorrow.
- No need.

787
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:19,928
- Mother, see you in a few days.
- All right.

788
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:22,806
- After you.
- No, after you.

789
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:25,434
- Actually...
- Let's go or we'll be late.

790
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:26,810
All right.

791
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:32,524
Qing, open the door.

792
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,444
I have to tell you...

793
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,046
What's wrong?

794
01:33:55,422 --> 01:33:59,509
In that box of his prayer beads...

795
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,680
Why did you touch his prayer beads?

796
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:05,057
Didn't you say they were precious?

797
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,309
I didn't tell you to take them!

798
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,688
- Did Ho Yunqing know?
- No.

799
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:17,486
What's up with the Lama?

800
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:20,155
He's trouble.

801
01:34:21,448 --> 01:34:22,949
Oh no!

802
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:55,482
Yunqing, what's on your mind?

803
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,443
The house where they live
is strange.

804
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:01,947
Let's go.

805
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:28,807
Cloud!

806
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:31,351
Who is that?

807
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:33,603
The lady proprietor's daughter.

808
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:38,608
There's a tavern here?

809
01:35:38,692 --> 01:35:40,110
The customers are all regulars.

810
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:42,612
They didn't used to run this tavern.

811
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,366
The girl's father
was a frontier magistrate.

812
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,909
He was martyred in the war.

813
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:51,037
His widow and daughter
opened this tavern.

814
01:35:52,456 --> 01:35:54,249
Hello Uncle Tsui.

815
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:58,044
Cloud, how are you?

816
01:35:58,128 --> 01:35:59,463
Fine, now that you're here.

817
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:00,547
Is your mother home?

818
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:02,591
Yes, she misses you.

819
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:03,967
Why haven't you come?

820
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,677
I've been busy lately.

821
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:09,097
This is my friend, Mr Ho.

822
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:10,432
Hello, Mr Ho.

823
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,350
And she is Miss Chuang.

824
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:13,935
Hello, Miss Chuang.

825
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,482
Let's go.

826
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,525
You didn't come to see us?

827
01:36:20,609 --> 01:36:22,360
We're going to the market.

828
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,030
I'll tell my mother
you didn't stop.

829
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:27,783
We're off, see you
on the way back.

830
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:28,825
Let's go.

831
01:36:28,909 --> 01:36:30,660
The market? Uncle Tsui...

832
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:32,245
What?

833
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,914
I just came from the market.

834
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:36,082
It's already winding down.

835
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:39,377
Ah, we were too slow.

836
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:40,504
Yes.

837
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:42,756
There's still a long way to go!
We won't make it.

838
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:43,924
Didn't I tell you?

839
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,926
I can buy those things any time.

840
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,302
Let's go back.

841
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:48,261
Fine.

842
01:36:48,345 --> 01:36:51,389
Uncle Tsui, you're not coming in?

843
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:56,770
Yunqing, care for a couple of drinks?

844
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:58,230
All right.

845
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:02,818
How is business?

846
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:04,736
What business?

847
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:06,238
You only sell vegetarian food?

848
01:37:06,321 --> 01:37:07,989
We can get meat dishes if you want.

849
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:10,075
No, I prefer to eat light.

850
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:22,587
Why did you close the gate?

851
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:25,841
Now that you're here,
we're temporarily closed.

852
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:27,342
What for?

853
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:28,885
I'll warm up the wine.

854
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:30,846
Please.

855
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:34,599
Mother, look who's here.

856
01:37:36,852 --> 01:37:38,311
Who's here?

857
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,483
This is Mr Ho.

858
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:45,986
Hello, Mr Ho.

859
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,612
This is Mrs Chuang.

860
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:49,072
Hello, Mrs Chuang.

861
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:50,574
Please.

862
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,332
- Please.
- Mr Tsui, please.

863
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:00,458
Yunqing, please.

864
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:01,585
Please.

865
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,545
Mr Tsui, please take your seat.

866
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:05,422
- No, after you.
- You are my elder.

867
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:07,382
This place is
just like home to me.

868
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:08,758
Make yourself at home.

869
01:38:08,842 --> 01:38:10,677
Come, sit.

870
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:12,470
You sit, too.

871
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:23,231
What do you think of this place?

872
01:38:23,315 --> 01:38:24,608
It's elegant.

873
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:27,402
We came a long way and
ended up having a drink here.

874
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:31,156
If my mother-in-law knew
she would be livid.

875
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:33,491
I can't stand your mother-in-law.

876
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:35,785
She is a bit talkative.

877
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:38,455
Mrs Chuang would be
a great mother-in-law,

878
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,373
so quiet and pleasant.

879
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:43,084
Don't make such a crass joke.

880
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:47,047
I'll take a drink as a punishment.

881
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:51,009
The wine here is better by the bowl.

882
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,344
Here's the bowl.

883
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,012
Oh, thank you.

884
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:55,430
Mr Ho, will you drink from a bowl?

885
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,599
No, I can't.

886
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:58,767
Thank you.

887
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,310
What about that Taoist on the hill?

888
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:01,603
Has he moved back?

889
01:39:02,062 --> 01:39:02,979
The Taoist?

890
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:06,608
The one that knows some magic.

891
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:08,777
Have you forgotten?

892
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:11,780
He used to do seances.

893
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:15,283
But then he harassed some woman
and people here drove him out.

894
01:39:15,367 --> 01:39:18,411
Now he lives up on the hill.

895
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:21,539
Mother, can you go
and have a look?

896
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:27,963
Oh, I remember,
I'll go and have a look.

897
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:39,432
Cloud, attend Mr Ho for me.

898
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:40,517
Please go ahead.

899
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:44,437
What's wrong?

900
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,898
Nothing, just a pesky Taoist priest.

901
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:49,025
Come, drain your glass.

902
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:52,570
Miss Chuang,

903
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:55,073
have you been to North Fort lately?

904
01:39:56,533 --> 01:39:57,867
Not for over half a year.

905
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:02,580
Have a drink.

906
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:04,290
All right.

907
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:41,369
He's left.

908
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:45,373
Where was I?

909
01:40:45,457 --> 01:40:47,333
- Illusions.
- Yes, illusions.

910
01:40:47,417 --> 01:40:51,463
Mr Tsui, do you believe in
the arts of invisibility and illusion?

911
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,465
I don't understand black magic.

912
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:54,716
No, I really...

913
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,342
Come, some wine.

914
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:57,677
I can't drink.

915
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,471
Come, pour the wine.

916
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:01,556
You have had a lot to drink.

917
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:04,476
If you won't serve me, I'll help myself.

918
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:06,186
I didn't mean that.

919
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:08,438
Mr Tsui, Mr Tsui.

920
01:41:11,024 --> 01:41:13,943
Mr Tsui, you're in a good mood today.

921
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:31,044
You know who knows black magic?
Your wife.

922
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:32,796
My Wife?

923
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:34,297
Mr Tsui is drunk.

924
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,423
Oh, that's quite enough.

925
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:38,635
Mr Tsui, don't drink any more.

926
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:39,677
There you go again.

927
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:40,720
Eat something first.

928
01:41:40,804 --> 01:41:42,180
Don't mind me.

929
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,850
Eat something? I can get it myself!

930
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:46,935
Mother...

931
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:50,897
- You bully me like all the rest.
- Nobody bullies you.

932
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,315
Who bullies you, Mr Tsui?

933
01:41:52,398 --> 01:41:53,942
Go to hell!

934
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,985
Your wife bullies me.

935
01:41:57,445 --> 01:41:58,905
What are you talking about?

936
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:02,450
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK.

937
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:06,996
Your wife, she is a devil!

938
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,414
You've said quite enough.

939
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:10,875
She'll get you, sooner or later.

940
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,418
All right, go inside and rest.

941
01:42:12,502 --> 01:42:14,671
He doesn't know what's going on.

942
01:42:14,754 --> 01:42:16,131
You have to tell him...

943
01:42:16,214 --> 01:42:17,757
What is this all about?
My wife's been nice to him.

944
01:42:17,841 --> 01:42:19,884
- It's all right.
- He's drunk, don't be angry.

945
01:42:19,968 --> 01:42:20,969
Strange.

946
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:22,720
Why did he suddenly mention my wife?

947
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:24,931
Drunk people talk nonsense. Sit.

948
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:27,142
No, <i>in vino veritas.</i>

949
01:42:27,225 --> 01:42:28,643
There's some truth in what he said.

950
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,228
I want to ask him.

951
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:31,646
Wait till he wakes up.

952
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,273
- Cloud?
- What?

953
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:37,068
Go for a climb to pick herbs for
Mr Tsui's hangover...

954
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:40,530
- Listen to me, you tell him...
- All right...

955
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:44,409
Why don't you take
Mr Ho for a walk?

956
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:47,787
The view there is lovely.
I will take you up.

957
01:42:47,871 --> 01:42:49,873
Strange, when I got married,
he was the matchmaker.

958
01:42:49,956 --> 01:42:52,208
- How could he...
- There's no telling why right now.

959
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:54,085
- Let me help you up.
- I can get up myself.

960
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,837
You two hurry up and go.

961
01:42:55,962 --> 01:42:57,422
- Let me tell you...
- Let's go!

962
01:42:57,505 --> 01:43:00,258
I don't know what's
gotten into him.

963
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:09,976
Mr Tsui has a bad temper.

964
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:13,104
The wine must have upset him.

965
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:16,524
He seems to have
something on his mind.

966
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:18,943
People here all do.

967
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:24,157
Is there something on your mind too?

968
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,742
Quite a bit, actually.

969
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:27,869
Can you tell me about it?

970
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:30,205
No, I can't.

971
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:34,125
Mr Ho, is there something on your mind?

972
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:35,335
Yes, there is.

973
01:43:37,921 --> 01:43:40,006
Would you like to hear about it?

974
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:41,799
All right.

975
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:45,595
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

976
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,305
Really?

977
01:43:49,766 --> 01:43:51,142
I've seen you before.

978
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:54,812
Maybe...

979
01:43:54,938 --> 01:43:57,148
Sometimes I meet a stranger,

980
01:43:57,232 --> 01:43:59,484
and feel like
I have seen them before.

981
01:43:59,609 --> 01:44:01,653
But in fact I never have.

982
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:02,779
Yes.

983
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:05,823
Sometimes I go somewhere new
and meet someone,

984
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:09,327
and feel that the scene
has happened to me before.

985
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:12,538
This must be Buddhist karma.

986
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:14,165
Karma?

987
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:17,043
Right, karma brought us together, no?

988
01:44:22,882 --> 01:44:24,592
No...

989
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,594
I really have seen you before.

990
01:44:26,678 --> 01:44:28,596
It was when I first got here.

991
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,431
I saw you many times.

992
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:31,891
I even waved to you.

993
01:44:31,975 --> 01:44:33,810
And then you were gone.

994
01:44:33,977 --> 01:44:35,645
You were probably seeing things.

995
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,522
I thought you were a fairy.

996
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:40,400
I never expected you would be real.

997
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:47,156
Real, but like a dream.
What could be better?

998
01:44:47,532 --> 01:44:50,410
Miss Chuang,
can you make yourself invisible?

999
01:44:52,203 --> 01:44:54,080
Don't be silly.

1000
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,416
Look!

1001
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:01,045
That's the hangover herb.

1002
01:45:14,851 --> 01:45:16,144
I can't get at it.

1003
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:17,520
Let me help you up.

1004
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:18,479
Would that be proper?

1005
01:45:18,604 --> 01:45:19,605
It's OK.

1006
01:45:21,107 --> 01:45:22,734
You shouldn't...

1007
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:31,159
Hurry up and pick it.

1008
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:06,527
I'll come down myself.

1009
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:14,786
Are you all right?

1010
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:16,037
I'm scared.

1011
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,790
Don't be afraid.

1012
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:21,584
Don't be afraid.

1013
01:46:49,404 --> 01:46:50,696
Hello, Mother.

1014
01:46:58,413 --> 01:46:59,622
Mother.

1015
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,250
You're back.

1016
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:10,258
Where's Mr Ho?

1017
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,426
Ah...

1018
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:16,514
Sorry, sorry.

1019
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:21,018
Mr Tsui just fell asleep.
Please ask Mr Ho to wait.

1020
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:26,149
Take this medicinal fungus to
the Taoist on the hill.

1021
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:27,608
I've already let him know.

1022
01:47:27,692 --> 01:47:29,902
He'll stew medicine for us in a bit.

1023
01:47:30,153 --> 01:47:31,696
I'm afraid to see him.

1024
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:35,324
Then leave it in the doorway for him.

1025
01:47:38,453 --> 01:47:39,996
Cloud?

1026
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:41,330
What?

1027
01:47:41,581 --> 01:47:43,708
Your skirt is dirty.

1028
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:49,130
I have to go out again. Mr Ho,
do you want to go for a walk?

1029
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:50,298
All right.

1030
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,550
I'll go and get changed.

1031
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:53,759
OK.

1032
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:37,845
Mr Ho, what are you looking for?

1033
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,556
Nothing. I just saw a Taoist priest.

1034
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:43,392
There are a lot of Taoists around.

1035
01:48:48,314 --> 01:48:50,066
Let's go.

1036
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:59,617
Mr Ho, what's on your mind?

1037
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:03,287
I came here for peace and quiet,

1038
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:06,999
not expecting all these eerie things.

1039
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:10,545
All you have to fear is fear itself.

1040
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:11,981
Look, that's our home.

1041
01:50:16,027 --> 01:50:17,653
What place is that?

1042
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,556
It's going to rain. Let's take shelter inside.

1043
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,015
No.

1044
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:20,568
It is scary in there.

1045
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,486
It's all right, I know a mudra.

1046
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:24,321
As if demons would bother me!

1047
01:52:24,405 --> 01:52:26,532
You wait here, I'll have a look.

1048
01:52:49,138 --> 01:52:52,308
Cloud Chuang, come here.

1049
01:53:07,323 --> 01:53:10,326
The mushroom you brought
is very helpful.

1050
01:53:10,409 --> 01:53:11,243
Thank you.

1051
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:13,662
But as for Melody,

1052
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:16,248
I cannot help you.

1053
01:53:16,415 --> 01:53:20,044
She has acquired powerful magic.

1054
01:53:20,294 --> 01:53:22,838
I can no longer subdue her.

1055
01:53:22,963 --> 01:53:25,132
Hurry up and leave Mr Ho.

1056
01:53:25,216 --> 01:53:28,177
If you don't,
you might never find release.

1057
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,762
Lama, I...

1058
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,482
Cloud, it's nice inside.

1059
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:49,323
What's wrong?

1060
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:51,158
Nothing.

1061
01:53:51,242 --> 01:53:52,535
Come in.

1062
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,831
What's wrong with you?

1063
01:53:57,790 --> 01:53:59,333
I'm afraid.

1064
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:47,983
Yunqing?

1065
01:55:48,901 --> 01:55:49,777
Yunqing.

1066
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:51,528
- Good morning, Mr Tsui.
- Uncle Tsui, you've sobered up?

1067
01:55:51,612 --> 01:55:52,696
You hurry back.

1068
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:55,074
If Melody gets mad,
you'll be in trouble.

1069
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:56,283
Mr Ho...

1070
01:55:56,367 --> 01:55:58,494
You two can talk tomorrow.

1071
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:09,046
I won't see you in.

1072
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:10,756
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1073
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,247
- You're back.
- Yes.

1074
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:26,707
What are you doing?

1075
01:57:26,999 --> 01:57:29,710
It's windy outside,
you can copy the sutra here.

1076
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:31,503
I'll take a nap before I start again.

1077
01:57:31,587 --> 01:57:34,048
Where were you last night?

1078
01:57:36,341 --> 01:57:39,344
I was drinking with Mr Tsui
at a friend's house.

1079
01:57:39,428 --> 01:57:40,929
At the Chuang house?

1080
01:57:41,013 --> 01:57:42,181
Yes.

1081
01:57:42,264 --> 01:57:43,891
Did you meet Cloud?

1082
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:45,350
Yes.

1083
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:52,399
That woman has always
been against me.

1084
01:57:52,483 --> 01:57:53,776
How has she been against you?

1085
01:57:55,235 --> 01:57:57,446
By seducing you!

1086
01:57:58,864 --> 01:58:00,574
What are you talking about?

1087
01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:02,534
Don't be so small-minded.

1088
01:58:02,618 --> 01:58:03,994
Don't move!

1089
01:58:04,078 --> 01:58:07,915
Oh, so I am small-minded,

1090
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:11,668
and that wretch is big-hearted?

1091
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:12,836
Well, then.

1092
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:16,673
I'll show you how small-minded I can be!

1093
01:58:17,216 --> 01:58:18,634
Kneel!

1094
01:58:18,717 --> 01:58:20,636
What a thing to say!

1095
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:28,102
My legs!

1096
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:36,068
Melody, what's wrong with my legs?

1097
01:58:40,948 --> 01:58:43,200
Hurry up and finish copying the sutra.

1098
01:58:43,283 --> 01:58:44,743
When I return, your legs will return to normal.

1099
01:58:44,827 --> 01:58:45,661
Melody!

1100
01:58:45,953 --> 01:58:47,830
Melody, where are you going?

1101
01:58:48,122 --> 01:58:50,165
To settle the score
with that woman.

1102
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:51,500
Melody, wait!

1103
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:54,920
Melody, wait!

1104
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:56,004
Melody!

1105
01:58:58,465 --> 01:59:03,220
Melody, Melody...

1106
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,490
Mister Ho!

1107
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:27,619
Mister! Mister!

1108
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:31,915
- Mister!
- Cloud, my legs...

1109
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:34,376
I know, don't worry. I'm coming.

1110
01:59:48,765 --> 01:59:50,934
- Cloud, my legs!
- Give me your hands.

1111
01:59:51,018 --> 01:59:52,978
- What are you doing?
- Close your eyes, don't speak.

1112
01:59:53,061 --> 01:59:54,313
- My legs...
- Sh!

1113
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:56,106
Close your eyes.

1114
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:02,905
Rise.

1115
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:09,203
What dark art did Melody use to...?

1116
02:00:09,286 --> 02:00:11,121
- Your life is in danger.
- My life?

1117
02:00:11,205 --> 02:00:12,623
You've got to get away.

1118
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:14,166
Get away?

1119
02:00:17,002 --> 02:00:20,214
When did you learn to do magic?

1120
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:24,092
After you finish copying the sutra,
Melody will kill you.

1121
02:00:24,176 --> 02:00:25,177
Why?

1122
02:00:32,017 --> 02:00:34,102
Because she is a demon.

1123
02:00:35,562 --> 02:00:39,066
Let's hurry.
Mr Tsui might be able to help.

1124
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:51,995
Mother!

1125
02:00:55,249 --> 02:00:57,125
- Mr Tsui!
- Yunqing, your life is in danger.

1126
02:00:57,209 --> 02:00:58,627
Find that Lama
at the East Gate Temple.

1127
02:00:58,752 --> 02:01:00,420
- Mother.
- Cloud, take him.

1128
02:01:00,545 --> 02:01:01,046
Cloud!

1129
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,589
What about my mother?

1130
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:05,509
Don't worry, I'm here.
Hurry or it'll be too late.

1131
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:21,525
No...

1132
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:23,860
What's wrong?

1133
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:38,250
- What's that?
- Don't move.

1134
02:02:01,106 --> 02:02:02,774
Qing!

1135
02:02:02,899 --> 02:02:05,235
Let's split up. You go that way...

1136
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:06,737
Don't look back, whatever you do.

1137
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:09,197
Mr Ho! Come home with me.

1138
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,246
- Run!
- What about you?

1139
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:17,205
Hurry.

1140
02:02:17,331 --> 02:02:18,665
Don't move!

1141
02:02:55,243 --> 02:02:56,453
Use the mudra!

1142
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:48,505
Cloud...

1143
02:03:48,755 --> 02:03:50,465
Cloud!

1144
02:03:53,176 --> 02:03:55,637
Cloud, what's wrong?

1145
02:03:56,388 --> 02:03:58,473
Don't worry about me,
just get out of here.

1146
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,268
Go!

1147
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:11,361
What are you doing?

1148
02:04:15,615 --> 02:04:17,784
Old Chang, what are you doing?

1149
02:04:34,551 --> 02:04:36,678
Mister, stop using your mudra!

1150
02:04:45,145 --> 02:04:47,397
Old Chang, we're not your enemy.

1151
02:04:47,481 --> 02:04:49,107
Why are you doing this?

1152
02:04:52,944 --> 02:04:54,362
Old Chang?

1153
02:04:54,446 --> 02:04:56,406
Why are you abetting her?

1154
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:58,700
Hasn't she hurt you enough?

1155
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:07,501
Let's find that Lama
and get him to release you.

1156
02:05:09,419 --> 02:05:11,046
Run!

1157
02:06:07,394 --> 02:06:08,311
EAST GATE TEMPLE

1158
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:47,642
Hurry over!

1159
02:07:06,703 --> 02:07:09,080
Yunqing, come with me.

1160
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:13,752
Come!

1161
02:07:33,647 --> 02:07:35,440
Let go!

1162
02:09:11,161 --> 02:09:15,540
Demon, if you keep haunting Mr Ho,
you'll be doomed to Hell forever.

1163
02:09:18,668 --> 02:09:23,757
Lama, Buddhists believe in compassion.
Why are you breaking up our marriage?

1164
02:09:24,048 --> 02:09:25,383
What marriage?

1165
02:09:25,467 --> 02:09:27,719
You only married him for the sutra.

1166
02:09:27,802 --> 02:09:29,012
Go!

1167
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:33,057
How dare you. Qing!

1168
02:11:33,344 --> 02:11:34,762
Melody, look!

1169
02:11:40,018 --> 02:11:41,477
See the evil you have wrought?

1170
02:14:11,961 --> 02:14:16,382
Melody, it's not too late to repent.

1171
02:14:17,175 --> 02:14:19,635
Stop bothering Mr Ho!

1172
02:14:19,719 --> 02:14:25,058
If you repent,
you might attain release.

1173
02:14:26,976 --> 02:14:30,354
If you don't,
I'll turn you over to the ghost warden,

1174
02:14:30,438 --> 02:14:32,148
and let him deal with you.

1175
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:36,069
- All right.
- Go now!

1176
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:49,373
Magic gourd!

1177
02:15:48,724 --> 02:15:50,017
Look!

1178
02:18:41,397 --> 02:18:42,982
General Han.

1179
02:18:45,026 --> 02:18:47,653
General, there's a new entertainer.

1180
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:50,114
Want to give her a chance?

1181
02:19:18,434 --> 02:19:20,853
If you make a decision now...

1182
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:30,446
General, this decision has to be made.

1183
02:22:41,971 --> 02:22:42,930
Good.

1184
02:23:27,182 --> 02:23:28,434
Halt.

1185
02:23:30,769 --> 02:23:32,479
I've come to see the General.

1186
02:24:04,178 --> 02:24:05,220
That's right.

1187
02:24:49,264 --> 02:24:51,684
CLOUD CHUANG'S TOMB

1188
02:25:30,681 --> 02:25:33,809
She's confessed everything, General.

1189
02:25:37,563 --> 02:25:40,357
Choke her to death!

1190
02:25:40,441 --> 02:25:41,191
Wait!

1191
02:25:42,568 --> 02:25:43,444
General Han.

1192
02:25:43,652 --> 02:25:45,279
If this gets out,

1193
02:25:45,362 --> 02:25:49,742
it wouldn't be good
for your reputation.

1194
02:25:58,041 --> 02:25:59,877
Then exile her.

1195
02:27:46,233 --> 02:27:47,317
Master!

1196
02:27:47,526 --> 02:27:49,736
Master, save me.

1197
02:27:51,530 --> 02:27:54,449
Your life on earth is over,
I can't save you.

1198
02:27:55,367 --> 02:27:58,579
But I won't be at rest.

1199
02:27:59,079 --> 02:28:00,956
What unfinished business do you have?

1200
02:28:03,083 --> 02:28:08,505
I want to become a powerful demon
to settle a score with someone.

1201
02:28:12,551 --> 02:28:14,386
All right.

1202
02:30:19,636 --> 02:30:21,555
Rise.

1203
02:31:23,867 --> 02:31:25,243
<i>Om mani padme hum.</i>

1204
02:31:27,079 --> 02:31:27,704
Look!

1205
02:31:51,853 --> 02:31:53,563
<i>Om mani padme hum.</i>

1206
02:31:54,564 --> 02:31:55,732
Look!

1207
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:24,845
<i>Om mani padme hum.</i> Look!

1208
02:33:41,963 --> 02:33:43,048
Master.

1209
02:33:44,174 --> 02:33:45,759
Tiger!

1210
02:33:45,884 --> 02:33:47,761
Tiger? Where?

1211
02:33:48,553 --> 02:33:49,930
In the gazebo.

1212
02:34:00,106 --> 02:34:01,900
Master, it was just a cat...

1213
02:34:01,983 --> 02:34:04,444
I know, I was seeing things.

1214
02:34:04,527 --> 02:34:06,321
Master...

1215
02:34:06,905 --> 02:34:08,907
Let me rest.

1216
02:35:02,168 --> 02:35:04,629
Yes, she's a ghost too.

1217
02:35:04,713 --> 02:35:05,922
You should have known.

1218
02:35:06,006 --> 02:35:07,924
They were both after the sutra.

1219
02:35:08,049 --> 02:35:11,094
Lama, I was once in it for the sutra,

1220
02:35:11,303 --> 02:35:13,555
but now...

1221
02:35:15,181 --> 02:35:16,474
I know.

1222
02:35:16,558 --> 02:35:19,311
But you must not bother Yunqing again.

1223
02:35:19,394 --> 02:35:20,812
But Lama, I...

1224
02:35:20,937 --> 02:35:22,689
I understand.

1225
02:35:22,981 --> 02:35:25,233
You're not going to hurt him.

1226
02:35:25,317 --> 02:35:28,862
But an affair between a man
and a ghost will never work out.

1227
02:35:28,945 --> 02:35:30,196
Go.

1228
02:36:16,910 --> 02:36:18,411
Damn monk! Let's fight it out.

1229
02:36:18,536 --> 02:36:19,996
Stop right there!

1230
02:36:21,748 --> 02:36:22,874
Master.

1231
02:36:27,879 --> 02:36:28,630
Reverend.

1232
02:36:34,469 --> 02:36:35,387
Go back with me.

1233
02:36:35,804 --> 02:36:37,972
Master, save me!

1234
02:36:46,564 --> 02:36:50,151
All right, I'll save you.

1235
02:36:50,276 --> 02:36:52,946
But you have to go with me.

1236
02:36:53,071 --> 02:36:54,572
What about Ho Yunqing?

1237
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:55,907
It's over.

1238
02:36:57,450 --> 02:36:59,452
And the Great Mudra Sutra?

1239
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:02,330
You can't ever mention it again.

1240
02:37:03,665 --> 02:37:05,500
Then hasn't it all been a waste?

1241
02:37:05,583 --> 02:37:06,793
Come with me!

1242
02:37:15,343 --> 02:37:19,264
Master, don't you want that sutra?

1243
02:37:19,389 --> 02:37:20,140
Come!

1244
02:37:33,903 --> 02:37:37,490
Ho Yunqing, hurry back
and bring the sutra here.

1245
02:37:37,574 --> 02:37:40,452
I'll find you a place to finish copying.

1246
02:37:42,662 --> 02:37:43,746
Watch out!

1247
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:12,108
Ho Yunqing, hurry back
for your prayer beads.

1248
02:38:14,027 --> 02:38:14,944
Lama...

1249
02:39:45,785 --> 02:39:47,620
Old Chang...

1250
02:39:49,998 --> 02:39:51,666
What?

1251
02:39:52,667 --> 02:39:54,252
Old Chang!

1252
02:39:57,505 --> 02:39:58,715
What?

1253
02:40:12,437 --> 02:40:13,855
Danger?

1254
02:41:57,792 --> 02:42:00,670
Quiet! Wardens, bring Ho Yunqing here.

1255
02:42:00,753 --> 02:42:01,754
All right.

1256
02:42:47,508 --> 02:42:49,260
Innkeeper!

1257
02:42:51,596 --> 02:42:53,097
Innkeeper!

1258
02:43:06,027 --> 02:43:08,821
Innkeeper, a pot of huadiao wine.

1259
02:43:10,364 --> 02:43:12,366
And a bowl of hot noodle soup.

1260
02:43:20,374 --> 02:43:22,084
Are they asleep?

1261
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:23,753
Innkeeper!

1262
02:43:30,468 --> 02:43:32,470
Innkeeper, wake up!

1263
02:43:33,221 --> 02:43:34,347
Wake up!

1264
02:43:38,810 --> 02:43:41,562
A pot of huadiao, a bowl of hot noodles.

1265
02:43:53,449 --> 02:43:54,992
The wine should be on the hot side.

1266
02:43:56,035 --> 02:43:58,120
We don't have anything hot here.

1267
02:43:59,038 --> 02:44:00,206
All right.

1268
02:44:00,289 --> 02:44:01,374
Then at least let the soup be hot.

1269
02:44:01,457 --> 02:44:03,000
Everything here is cold.

1270
02:44:05,461 --> 02:44:07,547
Innkeeper, this won't do.

1271
02:44:07,630 --> 02:44:09,173
How can I eat cold soup noodles?

1272
02:47:56,817 --> 02:47:57,818
Mister!

1273
02:47:57,902 --> 02:47:59,487
Hurry up and copy the sutra.

1274
02:47:59,570 --> 02:48:00,571
Cloud?

1275
02:48:03,783 --> 02:48:04,909
Cloud!

1276
02:48:04,992 --> 02:48:06,160
Mister, stay there.

1277
02:48:47,284 --> 02:48:49,245
Cloud, are you all right?

1278
02:48:49,328 --> 02:48:53,457
Mister, don't come in. I'll be OK soon.

1279
02:49:14,562 --> 02:49:15,771
Old Chang.

1280
02:49:19,191 --> 02:49:21,026
What are you doing?

1281
02:49:21,777 --> 02:49:23,070
Old Chang!

1282
02:49:26,615 --> 02:49:28,159
- Ah!

1283
02:49:32,997 --> 02:49:33,831
Mr Tsui.

1284
02:49:33,914 --> 02:49:35,332
Yunqing, the Lama told me to tell you

1285
02:49:35,416 --> 02:49:36,792
to finish copying as soon as possible.

1286
02:49:36,876 --> 02:49:38,919
- Now?
- Immediately.

1287
02:49:39,044 --> 02:49:40,588
What about Old Chang?

1288
02:49:44,341 --> 02:49:47,052
How can I copy with him here?

1289
02:49:47,845 --> 02:49:49,263
Old Chang, please leave.

1290
02:49:53,350 --> 02:49:55,519
I know, just leave.

1291
02:50:03,027 --> 02:50:04,445
Yunqing, hurry.

1292
02:50:04,570 --> 02:50:05,696
Mr Tsui,

1293
02:50:05,779 --> 02:50:07,198
what's the rush?

1294
02:50:07,364 --> 02:50:08,449
There's no time to waste.

1295
02:50:08,532 --> 02:50:09,366
Mr Tsui, you...

1296
02:50:09,450 --> 02:50:11,076
No, you sit, sit down.

1297
02:50:12,995 --> 02:50:15,915
Melody has been locked in Hell.

1298
02:50:15,998 --> 02:50:18,250
With her power, it's only a matter of time

1299
02:50:18,334 --> 02:50:20,044
before she escapes.

1300
02:50:20,461 --> 02:50:22,796
But what's the point of copying now?

1301
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:26,508
The Lama said, once you finish copying,

1302
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:28,594
you can use the mudra at will.

1303
02:50:28,677 --> 02:50:30,387
Though you might not overcome Melody,

1304
02:50:30,471 --> 02:50:32,389
you can at least protect yourself.

1305
02:50:33,390 --> 02:50:36,769
I can't focus if I copy it here.

1306
02:50:38,395 --> 02:50:41,273
Look, there he goes again.

1307
02:50:41,982 --> 02:50:43,150
Old Chang!

1308
02:50:43,234 --> 02:50:44,693
Yunqing, don't be afraid.

1309
02:50:44,777 --> 02:50:46,987
He's basically kind, he won't harm you.

1310
02:50:47,071 --> 02:50:49,365
But he's tried to choke me to death.

1311
02:50:49,448 --> 02:50:50,699
Not of his own volition.

1312
02:50:50,783 --> 02:50:52,201
He's under Melody's control.

1313
02:50:52,284 --> 02:50:54,119
Why does he listen to Melody?

1314
02:50:55,496 --> 02:50:57,248
Old Chang!

1315
02:50:57,957 --> 02:51:02,211
Three years ago, he came under her spell
and ended up like this.

1316
02:51:03,212 --> 02:51:05,005
Why did Melody do such a thing to him?

1317
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:11,345
If I tell you Old Chang's story,

1318
02:51:12,429 --> 02:51:14,640
maybe you can focus your mind.

1319
02:51:32,533 --> 02:51:36,036
He was a loyal officer to General Han.

1320
02:51:37,663 --> 02:51:42,167
After the rout, he took
a few men to guard the pass.

1321
02:54:30,586 --> 02:54:31,587
Who's there?

1322
02:54:57,070 --> 02:54:58,238
Who is it?

1323
02:55:07,581 --> 02:55:10,417
Who are you?

1324
02:55:10,501 --> 02:55:11,877
Get up, will you?

1325
02:55:12,044 --> 02:55:14,046
Get up!

1326
02:55:21,470 --> 02:55:23,514
What are you doing?

1327
02:55:51,917 --> 02:55:53,335
You bitch!

1328
02:56:40,340 --> 02:56:43,552
From that time he became...

1329
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:45,429
a half-man, half-ghost.

1330
02:56:51,393 --> 02:56:52,686
The Lama told me

1331
02:56:52,853 --> 02:56:56,148
Melody wanted to turn you
into another Old Chang.

1332
02:56:56,231 --> 02:56:57,816
Cloud and I were so worried!

1333
02:56:57,899 --> 02:56:59,651
I rushed here with your implements.

1334
02:56:59,901 --> 02:57:00,819
Then Old Chang...

1335
02:57:00,902 --> 02:57:02,696
I brought him here to help.

1336
02:57:10,704 --> 02:57:13,290
- Mr Tsui?
- No problem, don't move.

1337
02:57:30,432 --> 02:57:31,808
Mr Tsui...

1338
02:57:39,691 --> 02:57:41,151
Fear not...

1339
02:57:49,284 --> 02:57:50,744
Don't be scared.

1340
02:58:25,487 --> 02:58:27,406
Melody has escaped.

1341
02:58:31,910 --> 02:58:34,246
Hurry and finish copying.

1342
02:58:34,329 --> 02:58:36,581
My mind is a mess!

1343
02:58:36,707 --> 02:58:37,916
You have to copy no matter what.

1344
02:58:37,999 --> 02:58:38,834
Cloud...

1345
02:58:38,917 --> 02:58:41,628
Mr Ho, if not for yourself,
do it for the fallen soldiers.

1346
02:58:41,753 --> 02:58:42,963
You should do it for them.

1347
02:58:43,046 --> 02:58:44,881
- I'm dizzy.
- Mister!

1348
02:58:45,006 --> 02:58:46,466
- You can even copy it for me.
- I...

1349
02:58:46,550 --> 02:58:49,261
You heard the Lama:
it'll be the end of me if I see you again...

1350
02:58:49,344 --> 02:58:52,723
But I... I've come to see you anyway.

1351
02:58:57,352 --> 02:59:00,147
All right... I know...

1352
02:59:00,439 --> 02:59:01,857
The Lama has intercepted Melody.

1353
02:59:01,940 --> 02:59:03,233
Just relax and copy the sutra.

1354
02:59:06,862 --> 02:59:11,199
Cloud, get some mushrooms
and herbs for Yunqing.

1355
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:12,659
Let's go.

1356
02:59:12,743 --> 02:59:14,369
- I'm not hungry.
- I'll be back in a minute.

1357
03:00:28,443 --> 03:00:29,528
What's wrong?

1358
03:00:30,529 --> 03:00:32,948
Nothing, the Lama must have subdued her.

1359
03:00:33,073 --> 03:00:35,200
Nothing's the matter? All right.

1360
03:00:52,008 --> 03:00:53,927
Are you almost done?

1361
03:01:01,810 --> 03:01:03,854
I'm finally done.

1362
03:01:16,157 --> 03:01:19,494
Yunqing, you've done
a meritorious deed.

1363
03:01:19,578 --> 03:01:21,162
It's worth celebrating!

1364
03:01:21,246 --> 03:01:24,916
Heaven will bestow you with long life,
prosperity, and progeny.

1365
03:01:25,834 --> 03:01:27,419
I don't care about such things.

1366
03:01:27,502 --> 03:01:30,547
If I'm warm and well-fed,
I'll be satisfied.

1367
03:01:30,630 --> 03:01:31,715
I know what I want to do.

1368
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:32,757
What?

1369
03:01:33,174 --> 03:01:36,094
Leave this nest of ghosts
and sleep for three days.

1370
03:01:38,138 --> 03:01:39,306
Yunqing,

1371
03:01:39,389 --> 03:01:41,182
you should eat something
before you go to sleep.

1372
03:01:41,266 --> 03:01:42,559
I'm really not hungry.

1373
03:01:42,642 --> 03:01:44,019
Mister.

1374
03:01:46,062 --> 03:01:50,650
I couldn't find any herbs,
but I did find a few mushrooms.

1375
03:01:50,942 --> 03:01:52,235
You're back.

1376
03:01:52,819 --> 03:01:54,195
Have you finished copying?

1377
03:01:54,279 --> 03:01:56,698
The great deed is finally done.

1378
03:01:57,157 --> 03:01:58,950
Eat it while it's fresh.

1379
03:01:59,034 --> 03:02:00,994
I don't like to eat mushrooms.

1380
03:02:01,077 --> 03:02:03,246
- Let's sit down and talk it over.
- Sit.

1381
03:02:03,330 --> 03:02:05,957
You haven't slept in days.
You must be drained.

1382
03:02:06,041 --> 03:02:08,710
Eat some to replenish your energy.

1383
03:02:10,587 --> 03:02:12,130
Do I eat it like this?

1384
03:02:12,213 --> 03:02:13,340
Yes, eat it while it's fresh.

1385
03:02:13,423 --> 03:02:15,258
You have to eat something.

1386
03:02:16,718 --> 03:02:18,428
Mister!

1387
03:02:19,888 --> 03:02:21,681
- Don't eat it!
- That's Melody in disguise!

1388
03:02:21,765 --> 03:02:23,099
Old Chang, go and restrain her.

1389
03:02:23,183 --> 03:02:24,142
Mister!

1390
03:02:24,267 --> 03:02:27,354
Mister, don't eat it, it's poison.

1391
03:02:27,604 --> 03:02:30,315
- Get the beads!
- Take the sutra and run!

1392
03:02:30,774 --> 03:02:32,108
Get lost!

1393
03:02:32,359 --> 03:02:33,860
Come here.

1394
03:02:34,736 --> 03:02:36,988
Mr Tsui, why did you...?

1395
03:02:39,491 --> 03:02:41,242
Mister, come with me.

1396
03:02:41,326 --> 03:02:42,827
Come back.

1397
03:02:43,578 --> 03:02:44,829
Don't go over.

1398
03:02:50,794 --> 03:02:52,754
Old Chang, let her go!

1399
03:02:53,380 --> 03:02:54,422
Go get her.

1400
03:02:57,175 --> 03:02:59,135
She's Melody, don't move.

1401
03:03:01,221 --> 03:03:02,597
Old Chang, go get her!

1402
03:03:03,765 --> 03:03:05,392
Hurry!

1403
03:03:06,226 --> 03:03:08,812
Old Chang, what are you doing?

1404
03:03:09,479 --> 03:03:11,648
Uncle Tsui! Mr Ho!

1405
03:03:11,815 --> 03:03:13,400
Save me!

1406
03:03:13,483 --> 03:03:16,069
Mr Tsui, which one is the real Cloud?

1407
03:03:19,197 --> 03:03:20,740
Oh no! She's dead!

1408
03:03:21,157 --> 03:03:22,534
Old Chang, let go!

1409
03:03:27,372 --> 03:03:28,915
Mister.

1410
03:03:29,958 --> 03:03:31,084
Get the beads and run.

1411
03:03:33,044 --> 03:03:34,713
Tsui, which is the real...

1412
03:03:35,088 --> 03:03:38,508
That's odd. Neither of them
should be afraid of Old Chang.

1413
03:03:38,591 --> 03:03:40,468
Uncle Tsui,

1414
03:03:40,719 --> 03:03:43,013
Melody's poisoned me.
Save yourselves!

1415
03:03:45,015 --> 03:03:46,349
- Get the beads.
- Ah?

1416
03:03:46,433 --> 03:03:47,350
Hurry!

1417
03:03:49,102 --> 03:03:51,521
What are you doing?

1418
03:03:55,483 --> 03:03:56,776
Let go!

1419
03:03:57,569 --> 03:03:58,903
Mr Tsui!

1420
03:04:18,840 --> 03:04:20,592
Toss the beads at her.

1421
03:04:21,092 --> 03:04:22,093
Go.

1422
03:04:22,302 --> 03:04:24,137
Old Chang, don't toss the beads!

1423
03:04:25,930 --> 03:04:27,265
Toss the beads at her!

1424
03:04:33,813 --> 03:04:35,565
Don't toss the beads.

1425
03:04:38,151 --> 03:04:39,069
Old Chang...

1426
03:05:15,146 --> 03:05:16,648
Yunqing, get the beads!

1427
03:05:21,611 --> 03:05:22,862
Aim at her!

1428
03:05:59,774 --> 03:06:01,067
Mr Tsui!

1429
03:06:09,033 --> 03:06:13,454
"Adviser Tsui's... Spirit Tablet..."

1430
03:06:16,207 --> 03:06:17,041
Lama!

1431
03:06:20,253 --> 03:06:21,504
Old Chang!

1432
03:06:25,216 --> 03:06:26,551
Old Chang...

1433
03:06:44,444 --> 03:06:45,820
The sutra!

1434
03:08:13,116 --> 03:08:14,409
Ho Yunqing...

1435
03:09:40,745 --> 03:09:42,413
You haven't left yet?

1436
03:09:42,497 --> 03:09:44,123
I've already been.

1437
03:09:45,041 --> 03:09:46,292
You've already been?

1438
03:09:47,210 --> 03:09:48,169
I...

1439
03:09:51,297 --> 03:09:52,799
I'm going now.

1440
03:09:52,882 --> 03:09:54,300
Ah...

1441
03:12:06,599 --> 03:12:11,729
THE END

1
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,506
<i>The world is changed.

2
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:40,676
<i>I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:44,346
<i>I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:48,934
<i>I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:51,228
<i>Much that once was...

6
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:53,021
<i>...is lost.

7
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,733
<i>For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:14,042
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

9
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:16,211
<i>Three were given to the Elves:

10
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:20,174
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,302
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:28,474
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:30,184
<i>And nine...

14
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:33,395
<i>...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

15
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:37,441
<i>...who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:43,780
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:48,452
<i>But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:50,787
<i>For another ring was made.

19
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:55,209
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

20
00:01:55,626 --> 00:02:00,088
<i>...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

21
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:02,341
<i>...to control all others.

22
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,512
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,933
<i>...and his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:15,771
<i>One Ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:18,273
<i>One by one...

26
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:23,153
<i>...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

27
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:26,406
<i>But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:31,537
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

29
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:36,375
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

30
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:09,324
<i>Victory was near.

31
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,831
<i>But the power of the Ring...

32
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,083
<i>...could not be undone.

33
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:44,610
<i>It was in this moment...

34
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:47,195
<i>...when all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:51,533
<i>...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:29,112
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:38,163
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...

38
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:42,584
<i>...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:45,420
<i>But the hearts of Men...

40
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,131
<i>...are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:53,011
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,831
<i>It betrayed Isildur...

43
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,085
<i>...to his death.

44
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:33,135
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,679
<i>...were lost.

46
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:38,724
<i>History became legend...

47
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:40,934
<i>...legend became myth.

48
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:44,020
<i>And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:47,899
<i>...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,361
<i>Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:55,157
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:01,329
My precious.

53
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,124
<i>The Ring came to the creature Gollum...

54
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,211
<i>...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

55
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:11,381
<i>And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,675
It came to me.

57
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:18,305
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:23,226
My precious.

59
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:30,275
<i>The Ring brought
to Gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:34,321
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:39,117
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:42,579
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,665
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

64
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,668
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:52,172
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...

66
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,175
<i>...its time had now come.

67
00:06:57,594 --> 00:07:00,263
<i>It abandoned Gollum.

68
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:05,435
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,857
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,108
What's this?

71
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,777
<i>A Hobbit.

72
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:16,696
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

73
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,657
A ring.

74
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,742
Lost!

75
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,957
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,459
<i>For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,881
<i>...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:42,722
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,099
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:47,936
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:54,025
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,778
...the Shire...

83
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,781
...Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:07,747
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:23,305
<i>There and Back Again:

86
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,682
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.

87
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:28,351
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,359
Now...

89
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,070
...where to begin?

90
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:41,406
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,579
"Concerning...

92
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:50,415
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,086
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

94
00:08:55,253 --> 00:08:57,255
<i>...for many hundreds of years...

95
00:08:57,422 --> 00:09:00,383
<i>...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

96
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:03,762
<i>...by the world of the Big Folk.

97
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:09,768
<i>Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

98
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:13,104
<i>...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

99
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:17,317
<i>...being neither renowned
as great warriors...

100
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:21,696
<i>...nor counted among the very wise.

101
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:29,079
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:32,832
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some...

103
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:37,545
<i>...that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

104
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,090
<i>A rather unfair observation...

105
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:43,969
<i>...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

106
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:47,097
<i>...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

107
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:50,392
<i>But where our hearts truly lie...

108
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,727
<i>...is in peace and quiet...

109
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,563
<i>...and good, tilled earth.

110
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,944
<i>For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

111
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:08,493
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

112
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:13,915
<i>But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

113
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:20,380
<i>It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

114
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:27,762
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,879
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,437
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:44,779
<i>Down from the door where it began

118
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:53,288
<i>And I must follow if I can

119
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:58,376
<i>The road goes ever on and on

120
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:02,130
<i>Down from the door where it began

121
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:07,260
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone

122
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:11,681
<i>- And I must follow if I can</i>
- You're late.

123
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:18,772
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:24,194
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:38,666
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:46,216
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:50,053
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:54,099
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:56,726
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,895
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,897
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:03,817
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

133
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:10,281
<i>And so life in the Shire goes on...

134
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:13,535
<i>...very much as it has
this past Age...

135
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:19,249
<i>...full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

136
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,334
<i>If it comes at all.

137
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:26,047
<i>For things are made to endure
in the Shire...

138
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:29,717
<i>...passing from one generation
to the next.

139
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:35,098
<i>There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

140
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:36,599
<i>...in Bag End.

141
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:42,230
And there always will be.

142
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:46,276
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,904
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,866
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:58,580
<i>He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

146
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,927
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,789
He's up to something.

148
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:52,425
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:54,354
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,637
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,285
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:58,973 --> 00:13:59,974
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,477
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:08,983
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,737
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:16,991
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,327
Oh, really?

158
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,918
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,407
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,931
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:58,783 --> 00:14:59,826
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:04,497
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,712
So am I.

164
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:31,357
Whoa, whoa.

165
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:44,078
No, thank you!

166
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:48,207
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

167
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,919
And what about very old friends?

168
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,758
Gandalf?

169
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:00,928
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

170
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:06,267
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

171
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:10,021
You haven't aged a day.

172
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,613
Come on, come in!

173
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,240
Welcome, welcome.

174
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,952
Oh, here we are.

175
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:29,082
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

176
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:33,044
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

177
00:16:33,252 --> 00:16:37,298
Very good year.
Almost as old as I am.

178
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:42,970
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

179
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:45,807
Just tea, thank you.

180
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:51,979
Oh!

181
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,815
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

182
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:57,318
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

183
00:16:57,568 --> 00:17:02,824
You caught me a bit unprepared.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

184
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,327
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

185
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:10,498
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

186
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:15,128
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

187
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:18,172
I've just found some sponge cake.

188
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,532
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--

189
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,850
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

190
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:32,353
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

191
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:35,463
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

192
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,108
I'm not at home!

193
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,700
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

194
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,994
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

195
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:51,164
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

196
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:54,309
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

197
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,210
...never giving me a moment's peace.

198
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,548
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

199
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:05,219
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

200
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:09,390
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

201
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,851
All the arrangements are made.

202
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:15,396
Oh, thank you.

203
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,232
Frodo suspects something.

204
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,902
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

205
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,738
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

206
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:27,074
You will tell him, won't you?

207
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,036
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

208
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,748
I know.

209
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,420
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

210
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:43,549
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

211
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:47,428
The woods, the fields.

212
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,931
Little rivers.

213
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:57,104
I am old, Gandalf.

214
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:03,778
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

215
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:08,449
I feel thin.

216
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,284
Sort of stretched...

217
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,956
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

218
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:19,627
I need a holiday.
A very long holiday.

219
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:23,089
And I don't expect I shall return.

220
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,469
In fact, I mean not to.

221
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:35,268
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

222
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,617
Ah.

223
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:55,162
Gandalf, my old friend...

224
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,165
...this will be a night to remember.

225
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:22,023
Hello, hello.

226
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:26,360
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

227
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,989
Go on, Sam.
Ask Rosie for a dance.

228
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:36,162
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

229
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:38,998
Go on!

230
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,885
So there I was...

231
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:55,222
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

232
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:57,391
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

233
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:00,019
...about how they were
going to cook us.

234
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:05,232
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

235
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:09,820
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

236
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:13,574
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

237
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,078
...and turned them all to stone!

238
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,751
Quickly.

239
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:27,713
Whoa!

240
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,924
Up they go!

241
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:34,095
No, the big one.

242
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,107
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

243
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,234
Are all these children yours?

244
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:51,404
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

245
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:54,740
Bilbo?

246
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,119
Sackville-Bagginses!

247
00:21:58,369 --> 00:21:59,453
Quickly, hide!

248
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:11,465
Thank you, my boy.

249
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:15,386
You're a good lad, Frodo.

250
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,473
I'm very selfish, you know.

251
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,310
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

252
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,872
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

253
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:27,440
...but it wasn't out of charity.

254
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:29,608
I think it was because...

255
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,111
...of all my numerous relations...

256
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:35,906
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

257
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:37,997
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

258
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,910
No.

259
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:42,830
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

260
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:46,292
The point is, Frodo...

261
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:51,338
...you'll be all right.

262
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,844
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:58,512
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

264
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,181
This was your idea.

265
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,531
Bilbo.

266
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,535
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:25,039
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

268
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:42,223
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

269
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:47,978
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

270
00:23:48,145 --> 00:23:50,022
I might've known.

271
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,988
Speech, Bilbo!

272
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:00,199
Speech!

273
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,492
Speech!

274
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,041
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

275
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,044
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

276
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:14,713
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

277
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:15,965
...Hornblowers...

278
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,759
...Bolgers...

279
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,719
...Bracegirdles...

280
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,556
- ...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

281
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,894
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:32,231
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:36,735
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

284
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:39,780
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

285
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:43,450
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

286
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:48,247
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,377
I, uh--

288
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:00,593
I have things to do.

289
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:09,101
I've put this off far too long.

290
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:16,901
I regret to announce this is the end!

291
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:19,236
I'm going now.

292
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:23,240
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

293
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:26,827
Goodbye.

294
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:03,197
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

295
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,784
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

296
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:11,997
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

297
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,375
It was just a bit of fun.

298
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:18,295
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

299
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:23,217
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

300
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:26,095
As often as I can spare them.

301
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:29,473
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

302
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:33,018
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

303
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:37,523
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

304
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,568
No. Wait, it's...

305
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,740
...here in my pocket.

306
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:54,623
Isn't that--?
Isn't that odd, now?

307
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,753
Yet, after all, why not?

308
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:06,218
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

309
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:08,846
Is that so hard?

310
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,347
Well, no.

311
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:14,268
And yes.

312
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:19,273
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

313
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:21,275
It's mine.
I found it! It came to me!

314
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:25,696
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

315
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:27,948
It's mine.

316
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,702
My own.

317
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:36,040
- My precious.
- Precious?

318
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:39,084
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

319
00:27:39,293 --> 00:27:41,879
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

320
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:44,798
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

321
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,885
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

322
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:52,306
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

323
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:56,226
I am not trying to rob you.

324
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:02,983
I'm trying to help you.

325
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,787
All your long years,
we've been friends.

326
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:17,331
Trust me as you once did.

327
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,001
Let it go.

328
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:24,546
You're right, Gandalf.

329
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:29,343
The ring must go to Frodo.

330
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,680
It's late. The road is long.

331
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:36,350
Yes, it is time.

332
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:41,188
- Bilbo.
- Hm?

333
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:44,191
The ring is still in your pocket.

334
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,487
Ah. Yes.

335
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,895
I've thought up an ending for my book:

336
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:28,569
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

337
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:32,197
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

338
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,700
Goodbye, Gandalf.

339
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:40,080
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

340
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,092
<i>The road goes ever on and on

341
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:57,014
Until our next meeting.

342
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:28,086
<i>It's mine. My own.

343
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:31,673
<i>My precious.

344
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:34,885
Riddles in the dark.

345
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:36,511
Bilbo!

346
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:38,263
Bilbo!

347
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:44,811
My precious.

348
00:30:46,438 --> 00:30:48,649
Precious.

349
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:51,401
He's gone, hasn't he?

350
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:57,199
He talked for so long about leaving...

351
00:30:57,449 --> 00:31:00,160
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

352
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,500
Gandalf?

353
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,468
Bilbo's ring.

354
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,179
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

355
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:22,474
He's left you Bag End.

356
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:28,647
Along with all his possessions.

357
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:31,692
The ring is yours now.

358
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,823
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

359
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,271
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

360
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,705
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

361
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,208
I don't understand.

362
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:52,546
Neither do I.

363
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,176
Keep it secret.

364
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,095
Keep it safe.

365
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,257
<i>Shire!

366
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:40,719
<i>Baggins!

367
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:32,145
<i>"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

368
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:36,775
<i>Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

369
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:40,654
<i>...and the finding
of the Ring of Power."

370
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:45,992
<i>"It has come to me.

371
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,663
<i>The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

372
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,291
<i>All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

373
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,295
<i>...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

374
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,006
<i>It is precious to me...

375
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,510
<i>...though I buy it with great pain.

376
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:10,851
<i>The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

377
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:15,856
<i>The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

378
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:20,152
<i>A secret now
that only fire can tell."

379
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:39,671
Shire.

380
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:41,840
Baggins.

381
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,386
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

382
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:49,556
That way.

383
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,772
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe

384
00:34:57,939 --> 00:35:00,275
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow

385
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:02,402
<i>But there still be

386
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:04,029
<i>Many miles to go

387
00:35:04,237 --> 00:35:06,156
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

388
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:08,533
<i>And the stream that falls
From hill to plain

389
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:10,577
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook

390
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:13,163
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took

391
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,419
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

392
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:23,715
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

393
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:25,592
War is brewing.

394
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:29,095
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

395
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:31,932
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

396
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:36,603
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

397
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,773
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

398
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,399
And proud of it.

399
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:43,818
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

400
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:48,114
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

401
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:52,619
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

402
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:58,166
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

403
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:02,837
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

404
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:05,423
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

405
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,136
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

406
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,305
Does she?

407
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:15,976
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

408
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,253
Is it secret? Is it safe?

409
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:50,468
Ah.

410
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:54,264
What are you doing?

411
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,362
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

412
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:10,697
It's quite cool.

413
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:16,036
What can you see?

414
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:20,206
Can you see anything?

415
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,377
Nothing.

416
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:27,005
There's nothing.

417
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,549
Wait.

418
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:35,889
There are markings.

419
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,810
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

420
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:43,563
There are few who can.

421
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:48,943
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

422
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:50,612
Mordor!

423
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:52,906
In the common tongue, it says:

424
00:37:53,114 --> 00:37:56,618
"One Ring to rule them all...

425
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,204
...One Ring to find them...

426
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:01,581
...One Ring to bring them all...

427
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:04,918
...and in the darkness bind them."

428
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:08,588
This is the One Ring...

429
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:14,052
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

430
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,264
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

431
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:21,601
Bilbo found it.

432
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,978
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

433
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:28,775
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

434
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:32,362
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

435
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:37,450
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

436
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:39,994
The Ring has awoken.

437
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:42,956
It's heard its master's call.

438
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:47,085
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

439
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,884
No, Frodo.

440
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:59,139
The spirit of Sauron endured.

441
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:04,644
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

442
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:07,147
Sauron has returned.

443
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:10,150
His Orcs have multiplied.

444
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:14,362
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

445
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:19,325
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

446
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,619
He is seeking it.

447
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:25,665
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

448
00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:28,626
For the Ring yearns above all else...

449
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:32,213
...to return to the hand
of its master.

450
00:39:32,505 --> 00:39:34,215
They are one...

451
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:37,510
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

452
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:38,720
Frodo...

453
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:41,181
...he must never find it.

454
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:42,432
All right.

455
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:47,061
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

456
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:49,939
No one knows it's here, do they?

457
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,821
Do they, Gandalf?

458
00:39:57,864 --> 00:40:01,242
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

459
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:05,538
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

460
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:07,874
But the enemy found him first.

461
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:12,086
<i>I don't know how long
they tortured him.

462
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:16,758
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

463
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,093
Shire!

464
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,887
Baggins!

465
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:22,931
Shire.

466
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:26,059
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

467
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:29,896
Who goes there?

468
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:32,857
Take it, Gandalf!

469
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,275
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

470
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:36,861
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

471
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,406
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

472
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:44,118
I dare not take it.

473
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:46,913
Not even to keep it safe.

474
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:50,083
Understand, Frodo...

475
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,379
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

476
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:05,515
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

477
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,018
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

478
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:12,522
No, it can't.

479
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:19,237
What must I do?

480
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:24,450
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

481
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:27,912
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

482
00:41:28,162 --> 00:41:29,289
Bree.

483
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:32,250
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

484
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,919
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

485
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:38,840
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

486
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:41,050
I don't have any answers.

487
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:48,141
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

488
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:50,435
He'll know what to do.

489
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,855
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

490
00:41:54,147 --> 00:41:56,649
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

491
00:41:57,275 --> 00:42:00,570
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

492
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:04,365
I can cut across country
easily enough.

493
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:08,202
My dear Frodo.

494
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:11,539
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

495
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:14,667
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

496
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:17,211
And yet, after a hundred years...

497
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:19,464
...they can still surprise you.

498
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,383
Get down.

499
00:42:34,687 --> 00:42:38,149
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

500
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:42,820
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

501
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:45,406
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

502
00:42:45,615 --> 00:42:48,493
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

503
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:49,744
Nothing important.

504
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:54,415
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

505
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:59,379
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

506
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:01,714
No?

507
00:43:02,882 --> 00:43:04,050
Perhaps not.

508
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:08,721
I've thought of a better use for you.

509
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:13,434
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

510
00:43:14,936 --> 00:43:17,230
Be careful, both of you.

511
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:20,233
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

512
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:23,403
Birds, beasts.

513
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:26,948
Is it safe?

514
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:30,034
Never put it on...

515
00:43:30,243 --> 00:43:33,621
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

516
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:35,289
Always remember, Frodo...

517
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,960
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

518
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:41,462
It wants to be found.

519
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:24,297
This is it.

520
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,799
This is what?

521
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:29,135
If I take one more step...

522
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:33,514
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

523
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:39,312
Come on, Sam.

524
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:49,530
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

525
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:53,868
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
<i>- "Going out your door.

526
00:44:54,035 --> 00:44:58,498
<i>You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

527
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:02,835
<i>...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

528
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:18,684
Sam.

529
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:23,314
Wood-elves.

530
00:45:37,036 --> 00:45:40,540
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

531
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,875
To the Grey Havens.

532
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:45,503
They're leaving Middle-earth.

533
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,880
Never to return.

534
00:45:50,758 --> 00:45:52,885
I don't know why...

535
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:55,972
...it makes me sad.

536
00:45:58,057 --> 00:46:02,687
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

537
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:05,106
Just shut your eyes...

538
00:46:05,273 --> 00:46:08,067
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

539
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:12,196
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

540
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:24,208
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

541
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,253
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

542
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:31,924
Me neither, Sam.

543
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:03,497
<i>Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

544
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:05,333
<i>The hour grows late.

545
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:09,128
<i>And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

546
00:47:09,295 --> 00:47:11,756
<i>...seeking my counsel.

547
00:47:11,964 --> 00:47:15,968
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

548
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:17,428
My old friend.

549
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:19,305
Saruman.

550
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:27,146
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

551
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:30,191
So the Ring of Power has been found.

552
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:33,611
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

553
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:36,948
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

554
00:47:37,573 --> 00:47:42,078
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

555
00:47:42,954 --> 00:47:46,958
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

556
00:47:47,124 --> 00:47:48,584
Time?

557
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:52,129
What time do you think we have?

558
00:47:52,588 --> 00:47:56,467
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

559
00:47:56,634 --> 00:47:58,844
He cannot yet take physical form...

560
00:47:59,095 --> 00:48:01,806
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

561
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:07,520
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

562
00:48:08,104 --> 00:48:14,026
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

563
00:48:15,528 --> 00:48:18,698
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

564
00:48:19,615 --> 00:48:24,870
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

565
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,623
The Eye of Sauron.

566
00:48:27,832 --> 00:48:30,418
He is gathering all evil to him.

567
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:33,129
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

568
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:35,506
...for an assault upon Middle-earth.

569
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,217
You know this?

570
00:48:38,718 --> 00:48:40,219
How?

571
00:48:40,845 --> 00:48:42,513
I have seen it.

572
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,142
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

573
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:48,352
Why?

574
00:48:48,811 --> 00:48:51,522
Why should we fear to use it?

575
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:58,070
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

576
00:48:58,237 --> 00:49:01,490
We do not know who else
may be watching.

577
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:06,829
The hour is later than you think.

578
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,332
Sauron's forces are already moving.

579
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:14,337
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

580
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:15,755
The Nine?

581
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:19,008
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

582
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:21,844
...disguised as riders in black.

583
00:49:22,053 --> 00:49:26,015
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

584
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,852
And kill the one who carries it.

585
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:31,854
Frodo!

586
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:48,871
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

587
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:52,416
There are none who can.

588
00:49:54,919 --> 00:49:57,630
Against the power of Mordor...

589
00:49:57,797 --> 00:50:00,466
...there can be no victory.

590
00:50:02,426 --> 00:50:05,596
We must join with him, Gandalf.

591
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:09,225
We must join with Sauron.

592
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:14,563
It would be wise, my friend.

593
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:16,482
Tell me...

594
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:17,733
...friend...

595
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:23,280
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

596
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:04,488
I gave you the chance...

597
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:08,284
...of aiding me willingly...

598
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:12,621
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

599
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:37,396
Mr. Frodo?

600
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:39,815
Frodo? Frodo!

601
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:44,487
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

602
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:47,656
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

603
00:51:48,491 --> 00:51:52,369
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

604
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,248
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

605
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,252
Frodo.

606
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:02,755
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

607
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:04,340
Get off him.

608
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,342
Come on, Frodo.

609
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:08,385
What's the meaning of this?

610
00:52:08,844 --> 00:52:10,596
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

611
00:52:13,098 --> 00:52:15,226
You get back here!

612
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:17,561
Get out of my field!

613
00:52:17,728 --> 00:52:20,564
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

614
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:23,734
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

615
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:25,027
And some cabbages.

616
00:52:25,194 --> 00:52:28,113
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

617
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,368
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

618
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:34,745
...he's clearly overreacting.

619
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,455
Run!

620
00:52:49,927 --> 00:52:52,471
Oh, that was close.

621
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:56,684
I think I've broken something.

622
00:52:57,685 --> 00:53:00,062
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

623
00:53:00,229 --> 00:53:03,899
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

624
00:53:04,066 --> 00:53:06,318
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

625
00:53:15,077 --> 00:53:16,579
That's mine.

626
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:20,958
That's nice, Merry.

627
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,502
Here's a nice one, Sam.

628
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:26,255
I think we should get off the road.

629
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:36,807
Get off the road!

630
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:38,517
Quick!

631
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:52,698
Be quiet!

632
00:54:59,014 --> 00:55:01,183
What was that?

633
00:55:33,882 --> 00:55:35,384
Anything?

634
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:37,553
Nothing.

635
00:55:38,262 --> 00:55:40,556
What is going on?

636
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:44,893
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

637
00:55:46,228 --> 00:55:47,730
Frodo?

638
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:49,481
Get down!

639
00:56:06,415 --> 00:56:08,667
I have to leave the Shire.

640
00:56:09,668 --> 00:56:11,962
Sam and I must get to Bree.

641
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:13,589
Right.

642
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:17,259
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

643
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:26,894
Run!

644
00:56:28,103 --> 00:56:30,105
This way! Follow me!

645
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:34,693
Run!

646
00:56:47,956 --> 00:56:49,708
Get the rope, Sam!

647
00:56:52,377 --> 00:56:53,921
Frodo!

648
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,048
Run, Frodo!

649
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:57,466
- Go!
- Hurry!

650
00:56:57,674 --> 00:57:00,302
Frodo, come on!

651
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,222
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

652
00:57:18,195 --> 00:57:22,407
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

653
00:57:37,005 --> 00:57:38,507
Come on.

654
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:53,105
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

655
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:59,444
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

656
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:03,574
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

657
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:07,119
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

658
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,706
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

659
00:58:10,873 --> 00:58:13,417
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

660
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:16,420
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

661
00:58:16,587 --> 00:58:18,755
Can't be too careful.

662
00:58:38,483 --> 00:58:41,987
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

663
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:07,763
Excuse me.

664
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:11,600
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

665
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:17,856
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

666
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:22,694
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

667
00:59:23,862 --> 00:59:25,906
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

668
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:29,701
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

669
00:59:29,868 --> 00:59:33,038
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

670
00:59:33,455 --> 00:59:35,207
Gandalf.

671
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:37,709
Oh, yes...

672
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:40,045
...I remember. Elderly chap.

673
00:59:40,379 --> 00:59:43,298
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

674
00:59:43,715 --> 00:59:45,550
Not seen him for six months.

675
00:59:52,307 --> 00:59:53,600
What do we do now?

676
01:00:00,816 --> 01:00:02,067
Sam...

677
01:00:02,234 --> 01:00:04,111
...he'll be here. He'll come.

678
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:08,949
Get out of my way!

679
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:12,995
What's that?

680
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:15,747
This, my friend, is a pint.

681
01:00:15,914 --> 01:00:17,582
It comes in pints?

682
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:21,628
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

683
01:00:27,968 --> 01:00:31,805
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

684
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:36,852
Excuse me.

685
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:41,648
That Man in the corner.
Who is he?

686
01:00:42,816 --> 01:00:47,237
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

687
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:51,992
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

688
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:55,620
Strider.

689
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:11,845
<i>Baggins.

690
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:16,850
<i>Baggins.

691
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:27,360
<i>Baggins. Baggins.

692
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:31,490
Baggins?
Sure, I know a Baggins.

693
01:01:32,282 --> 01:01:35,160
He's over there.
Frodo Baggins.

694
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:38,371
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

695
01:01:38,538 --> 01:01:40,832
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

696
01:01:45,337 --> 01:01:47,089
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

697
01:02:16,618 --> 01:02:19,079
You cannot hide.

698
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,210
I see you.

699
01:02:26,878 --> 01:02:29,589
There is no life...

700
01:02:29,756 --> 01:02:31,967
...in the void.

701
01:02:32,134 --> 01:02:33,635
Only...

702
01:02:34,553 --> 01:02:36,054
...death.

703
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:46,940
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

704
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:52,654
What do you want?

705
01:02:52,863 --> 01:02:55,258
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

706
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:58,285
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

707
01:02:58,577 --> 01:03:01,121
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

708
01:03:01,288 --> 01:03:05,000
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

709
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,128
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

710
01:03:09,379 --> 01:03:10,422
Yes.

711
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:14,509
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

712
01:03:18,513 --> 01:03:21,057
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

713
01:03:22,726 --> 01:03:26,855
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

714
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:29,941
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

715
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,109
They're coming.

716
01:04:54,818 --> 01:04:56,319
What are they?

717
01:04:58,488 --> 01:05:00,615
They were once Men.

718
01:05:01,116 --> 01:05:03,326
Great kings of Men.

719
01:05:03,535 --> 01:05:06,705
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

720
01:05:07,289 --> 01:05:10,375
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

721
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,962
One by one, falling into darkness.

722
01:05:14,129 --> 01:05:16,631
Now they are slaves to his will.

723
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:20,719
They are the Nazgûl.

724
01:05:20,885 --> 01:05:23,638
Ringwraiths.
Neither living nor dead.

725
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:25,849
At all times they feel...

726
01:05:26,016 --> 01:05:27,976
<i>...the presence of the Ring...

727
01:05:28,143 --> 01:05:32,689
<i>...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

728
01:05:42,657 --> 01:05:45,577
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

729
01:05:53,752 --> 01:05:57,881
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

730
01:05:58,048 --> 01:06:00,884
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

731
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:05,180
- ...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

732
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:08,600
We have no choice but to trust him.

733
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,228
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

734
01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:17,901
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

735
01:06:18,443 --> 01:06:21,237
We're going to see the Elves.

736
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:47,138
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

737
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:49,974
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

738
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:52,394
What about second breakfast?

739
01:06:55,814 --> 01:06:58,983
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

740
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:04,406
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

741
01:07:04,614 --> 01:07:08,785
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

742
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:15,834
Pippin!

743
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:35,854
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

744
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:16,728
Who is she?

745
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:20,023
This woman you sing of.

746
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:25,862
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

747
01:08:26,029 --> 01:08:31,201
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

748
01:08:33,036 --> 01:08:35,163
What happened to her?

749
01:08:37,373 --> 01:08:39,876
She died.

750
01:08:43,922 --> 01:08:46,257
Get some sleep, Frodo.

751
01:08:56,518 --> 01:09:00,605
<i>The power of Isengard
is at your command...

752
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:05,235
<i>...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

753
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:14,369
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

754
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:24,546
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

755
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:26,923
We have work to do.

756
01:10:09,507 --> 01:10:14,137
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

757
01:10:14,512 --> 01:10:16,347
Rip them all down.

758
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:46,669
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

759
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:51,049
We shall rest here tonight.

760
01:11:02,769 --> 01:11:06,189
These are for you.
Keep them close.

761
01:11:06,397 --> 01:11:08,900
I'm going to have a look around.

762
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:13,196
Stay here.

763
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,909
My tomato's burst.

764
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,036
Could I have some bacon?

765
01:11:20,244 --> 01:11:22,205
Want a tomato, Sam?

766
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:26,250
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

767
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:29,170
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

768
01:11:29,379 --> 01:11:33,383
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

769
01:11:41,808 --> 01:11:43,559
Go!

770
01:12:36,988 --> 01:12:38,448
Back, you devils!

771
01:14:01,948 --> 01:14:03,199
Frodo!

772
01:14:07,245 --> 01:14:09,080
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

773
01:14:46,117 --> 01:14:47,118
Strider!

774
01:14:49,912 --> 01:14:55,418
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

775
01:14:56,919 --> 01:15:01,799
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

776
01:15:06,387 --> 01:15:07,430
Hurry!

777
01:15:07,638 --> 01:15:11,601
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

778
01:15:11,809 --> 01:15:13,644
Hold on, Frodo.

779
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:16,272
Gandalf!

780
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,266
Look, Frodo.
It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

781
01:17:59,435 --> 01:18:02,271
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

782
01:18:05,232 --> 01:18:06,984
Is he going to die?

783
01:18:07,193 --> 01:18:12,073
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

784
01:18:17,244 --> 01:18:21,082
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

785
01:18:21,248 --> 01:18:22,750
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

786
01:18:22,917 --> 01:18:24,037
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

787
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:27,338
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

788
01:18:41,727 --> 01:18:45,856
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

789
01:19:10,756 --> 01:19:11,799
Frodo.

790
01:19:28,732 --> 01:19:30,568
Who is she?

791
01:19:31,235 --> 01:19:32,987
Frodo.

792
01:19:33,237 --> 01:19:36,740
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

793
01:19:38,993 --> 01:19:41,162
He's not going to last.

794
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,039
We must get him to my father.

795
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:47,668
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

796
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:53,924
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

797
01:20:01,765 --> 01:20:03,017
What are they saying?

798
01:20:09,106 --> 01:20:10,774
I do not fear them.

799
01:20:20,618 --> 01:20:22,036
Arwen...

800
01:20:22,203 --> 01:20:25,414
...ride hard. Don't look back.

801
01:20:30,461 --> 01:20:34,840
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

802
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:32,166
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

803
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:35,669
If you want him, come and claim him.

804
01:23:29,556 --> 01:23:32,059
No. No!

805
01:23:35,312 --> 01:23:37,606
Frodo, no.

806
01:23:37,815 --> 01:23:40,109
Frodo, don't give in.

807
01:23:40,317 --> 01:23:42,319
Not now.

808
01:23:53,247 --> 01:23:55,749
<i>What grace is given me...

809
01:23:56,417 --> 01:23:58,252
<i>...let it pass to him.

810
01:23:58,502 --> 01:24:00,629
<i>Let him be spared.

811
01:24:01,255 --> 01:24:03,298
<i>Save him.

812
01:24:15,686 --> 01:24:20,858
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

813
01:24:21,316 --> 01:24:27,823
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

814
01:24:29,783 --> 01:24:33,579
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

815
01:24:35,205 --> 01:24:38,292
And you're lucky to be here too.

816
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:42,963
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

817
01:24:43,172 --> 01:24:47,301
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

818
01:24:54,892 --> 01:24:57,394
What happened, Gandalf?

819
01:24:58,353 --> 01:25:03,734
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

820
01:25:08,489 --> 01:25:10,240
I was delayed.

821
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:15,329
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

822
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:24,087
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

823
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:27,132
Embrace the power of the Ring...

824
01:25:27,674 --> 01:25:30,219
...or embrace your own destruction!

825
01:25:32,513 --> 01:25:36,391
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

826
01:25:36,642 --> 01:25:40,646
Only one who can bend it to his will.

827
01:25:41,438 --> 01:25:45,400
And he does not share power.

828
01:25:59,748 --> 01:26:03,126
So you have chosen death.

829
01:26:13,178 --> 01:26:16,974
Gandalf? What is it?

830
01:26:17,933 --> 01:26:19,726
Nothing, Frodo.

831
01:26:20,394 --> 01:26:22,229
Frodo!

832
01:26:22,437 --> 01:26:23,480
Frodo!

833
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:26,066
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

834
01:26:26,275 --> 01:26:28,986
Sam has hardly left your side.

835
01:26:29,236 --> 01:26:31,436
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

836
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:36,910
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

837
01:26:38,412 --> 01:26:41,999
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

838
01:27:30,047 --> 01:27:33,383
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

839
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,260
Bilbo.

840
01:27:40,265 --> 01:27:42,017
<i>"There and Back Again:

841
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:45,020
<i>A Hobbit's Tale,</i> by Bilbo Baggins."

842
01:27:48,065 --> 01:27:51,652
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

843
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:55,781
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

844
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,533
...visit Lake-town...

845
01:27:58,784 --> 01:28:02,162
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

846
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:07,501
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

847
01:28:19,596 --> 01:28:21,390
I miss the Shire.

848
01:28:21,807 --> 01:28:26,937
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

849
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:30,857
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

850
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:37,406
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

851
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:45,831
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

852
01:28:46,957 --> 01:28:49,292
My dear boy.

853
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:57,342
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

854
01:28:58,135 --> 01:28:59,928
No harm in being prepared.

855
01:29:00,137 --> 01:29:02,723
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

856
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:05,809
- More than anything.
- I did.

857
01:29:05,976 --> 01:29:07,894
It's just...

858
01:29:08,645 --> 01:29:11,314
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

859
01:29:11,481 --> 01:29:15,152
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

860
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,655
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

861
01:29:18,864 --> 01:29:20,574
Off home.

862
01:29:24,745 --> 01:29:26,747
You are right, Sam.

863
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:31,668
We did what we set out to do.

864
01:29:32,252 --> 01:29:34,838
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

865
01:29:38,925 --> 01:29:41,261
I am ready to go home.

866
01:29:42,012 --> 01:29:44,097
His strength returns.

867
01:29:44,264 --> 01:29:49,978
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

868
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,106
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

869
01:29:53,273 --> 01:29:56,985
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

870
01:29:57,194 --> 01:30:00,530
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

871
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:06,203
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

872
01:30:06,411 --> 01:30:11,041
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

873
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:14,044
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

874
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:17,464
Our list of allies grows thin.

875
01:30:18,215 --> 01:30:21,009
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

876
01:30:21,218 --> 01:30:24,888
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

877
01:30:25,055 --> 01:30:27,516
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

878
01:30:27,808 --> 01:30:32,395
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

879
01:30:32,562 --> 01:30:34,981
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

880
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,486
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

881
01:30:39,694 --> 01:30:44,074
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

882
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:48,995
Gandalf...

883
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:52,916
...the Ring cannot stay here.

884
01:31:12,435 --> 01:31:15,605
<i>This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

885
01:31:15,856 --> 01:31:18,567
<i>They must decide now how to end it.

886
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:23,196
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

887
01:31:23,864 --> 01:31:27,450
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

888
01:31:27,617 --> 01:31:32,747
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

889
01:31:34,374 --> 01:31:37,210
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

890
01:31:37,544 --> 01:31:39,254
Men?

891
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:43,383
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

892
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:48,013
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

893
01:31:48,305 --> 01:31:51,808
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

894
01:31:52,017 --> 01:31:53,643
I was there, Gandalf.

895
01:31:54,311 --> 01:31:57,147
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...

896
01:32:03,987 --> 01:32:06,406
<i>...when Isildur took the Ring.

897
01:32:06,573 --> 01:32:10,493
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

898
01:32:13,038 --> 01:32:15,582
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

899
01:32:17,167 --> 01:32:20,795
<i>I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

900
01:32:21,046 --> 01:32:24,591
<i>...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

901
01:32:24,758 --> 01:32:27,344
Cast it into the fire!

902
01:32:32,515 --> 01:32:36,311
- Destroy it!
- No.

903
01:32:37,646 --> 01:32:39,814
Isildur!

904
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:45,028
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

905
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:53,370
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

906
01:32:54,287 --> 01:32:57,958
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

907
01:32:58,124 --> 01:33:02,963
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

908
01:33:03,171 --> 01:33:06,549
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

909
01:33:08,218 --> 01:33:12,055
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

910
01:33:12,222 --> 01:33:14,349
He has chosen exile.

911
01:33:45,588 --> 01:33:47,590
You are no Elf.

912
01:33:47,757 --> 01:33:49,843
Men of the South are welcome here.

913
01:33:50,427 --> 01:33:53,930
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

914
01:33:55,432 --> 01:33:58,268
Then we are here on common purpose...

915
01:33:58,643 --> 01:34:00,103
...friend.

916
01:34:15,285 --> 01:34:18,204
The shards of Narsil.

917
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:26,129
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

918
01:34:29,049 --> 01:34:31,301
It's still sharp.

919
01:34:40,185 --> 01:34:43,271
But no more than a broken heirloom.

920
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:13,134
Why do you fear the past?

921
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:19,349
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

922
01:35:19,599 --> 01:35:23,019
You are not bound to his fate.

923
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,524
The same blood flows in my veins.

924
01:35:30,527 --> 01:35:33,113
The same weakness.

925
01:35:35,824 --> 01:35:38,618
Your time will come.

926
01:35:38,827 --> 01:35:43,206
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

927
01:36:33,756 --> 01:36:36,426
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

928
01:36:38,428 --> 01:36:43,433
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

929
01:36:44,559 --> 01:36:46,436
And to that I hold.

930
01:36:46,603 --> 01:36:50,231
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

931
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:54,360
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

932
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:06,581
I choose a mortal life.

933
01:37:07,916 --> 01:37:12,170
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

934
01:37:15,423 --> 01:37:17,926
...like my heart.

935
01:37:33,691 --> 01:37:37,403
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

936
01:37:37,612 --> 01:37:41,532
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

937
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:47,038
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

938
01:37:47,288 --> 01:37:50,792
You will unite, or you will fall.

939
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,296
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

940
01:37:57,131 --> 01:38:00,635
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

941
01:38:14,691 --> 01:38:16,442
So it is true.

942
01:38:33,876 --> 01:38:36,004
In a dream...

943
01:38:37,588 --> 01:38:40,717
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

944
01:38:41,009 --> 01:38:42,719
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

945
01:38:43,511 --> 01:38:45,263
A voice was crying:

946
01:38:45,555 --> 01:38:48,474
"Your doom is near at hand.

947
01:38:49,475 --> 01:38:52,228
Isildur's Bane is found."

948
01:38:56,232 --> 01:38:58,067
Isildur's Bane.

949
01:38:58,735 --> 01:39:00,028
Boromir!

950
01:39:23,217 --> 01:39:27,055
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

951
01:39:27,221 --> 01:39:30,933
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

952
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,227
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

953
01:39:33,519 --> 01:39:34,896
...may yet be heard...

954
01:39:35,063 --> 01:39:38,066
...in every corner of the West!

955
01:39:38,232 --> 01:39:40,902
The Ring is altogether evil.

956
01:39:41,235 --> 01:39:42,737
It is a gift.

957
01:39:43,321 --> 01:39:45,406
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

958
01:39:46,032 --> 01:39:48,117
Why not use this Ring?

959
01:39:48,326 --> 01:39:51,079
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

960
01:39:51,287 --> 01:39:55,625
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

961
01:39:55,917 --> 01:39:58,127
...are your lands kept safe.

962
01:39:59,921 --> 01:40:04,258
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

963
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:08,304
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

964
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:12,975
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

965
01:40:13,142 --> 01:40:16,687
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

966
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:18,981
This is no mere Ranger.

967
01:40:19,982 --> 01:40:23,653
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

968
01:40:24,153 --> 01:40:27,073
You owe him your allegiance.

969
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,079
Aragorn.

970
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:37,667
This is Isildur's heir?

971
01:40:40,002 --> 01:40:42,713
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

972
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,515
Gondor has no king.

973
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:56,018
Gondor needs no king.

974
01:41:02,692 --> 01:41:06,362
Aragorn is right.
We cannot use it.

975
01:41:07,363 --> 01:41:10,867
You have only one choice.

976
01:41:11,117 --> 01:41:13,494
The Ring must be destroyed.

977
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:21,252
What are we waiting for?

978
01:41:33,389 --> 01:41:36,392
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

979
01:41:36,642 --> 01:41:40,897
...by any craft that we here possess.

980
01:41:41,397 --> 01:41:45,568
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

981
01:41:45,735 --> 01:41:49,572
Only there can it be unmade.

982
01:41:50,615 --> 01:41:53,242
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

983
01:41:53,409 --> 01:41:58,414
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

984
01:42:00,416 --> 01:42:02,418
One of you...

985
01:42:02,919 --> 01:42:05,087
...must do this.

986
01:42:08,007 --> 01:42:11,719
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

987
01:42:12,595 --> 01:42:16,265
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

988
01:42:17,099 --> 01:42:21,229
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

989
01:42:21,437 --> 01:42:25,650
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

990
01:42:26,442 --> 01:42:28,444
It is a barren wasteland...

991
01:42:28,653 --> 01:42:32,281
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

992
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,285
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

993
01:42:36,536 --> 01:42:40,790
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

994
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:45,461
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

995
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:48,297
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

996
01:42:48,464 --> 01:42:53,135
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

997
01:42:53,302 --> 01:42:58,641
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

998
01:43:00,643 --> 01:43:03,145
Never trust an Elf!

999
01:43:04,313 --> 01:43:10,152
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

1000
01:43:10,486 --> 01:43:13,322
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1001
01:43:32,133 --> 01:43:34,343
I will take it.

1002
01:43:36,345 --> 01:43:38,848
I will take it.

1003
01:43:44,687 --> 01:43:47,732
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1004
01:43:55,781 --> 01:43:57,033
Though...

1005
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:01,954
...I do not know the way.

1006
01:44:03,956 --> 01:44:08,294
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1007
01:44:08,461 --> 01:44:11,839
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1008
01:44:12,965 --> 01:44:16,052
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1009
01:44:16,802 --> 01:44:18,137
...I will.

1010
01:44:21,349 --> 01:44:23,643
You have my sword.

1011
01:44:25,478 --> 01:44:27,563
And you have my bow.

1012
01:44:28,147 --> 01:44:30,650
And my ax.

1013
01:44:37,657 --> 01:44:40,660
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1014
01:44:42,662 --> 01:44:46,332
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1015
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:49,210
- ...then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

1016
01:44:51,837 --> 01:44:56,592
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1017
01:44:56,801 --> 01:45:01,681
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1018
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:04,141
We're coming too!

1019
01:45:06,268 --> 01:45:09,021
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1020
01:45:09,271 --> 01:45:12,608
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1021
01:45:12,942 --> 01:45:14,276
...mission.

1022
01:45:14,443 --> 01:45:15,945
Quest.

1023
01:45:16,404 --> 01:45:17,446
Thing.

1024
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:21,951
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1025
01:45:23,536 --> 01:45:25,454
Nine companions.

1026
01:45:27,289 --> 01:45:29,125
So be it.

1027
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:32,461
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1028
01:45:33,129 --> 01:45:34,964
Great!

1029
01:45:35,172 --> 01:45:37,466
Where are we going?

1030
01:46:23,587 --> 01:46:27,090
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1031
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:29,259
That you'd never escape your fate.

1032
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,430
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1033
01:46:33,847 --> 01:46:37,768
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1034
01:46:38,769 --> 01:46:41,271
I do not want that power.

1035
01:46:41,438 --> 01:46:44,107
I have never wanted it.

1036
01:46:45,442 --> 01:46:48,070
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1037
01:46:52,449 --> 01:46:54,785
My old sword! Sting.

1038
01:46:54,993 --> 01:46:56,119
Here, take it. Take it.

1039
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:05,587
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1040
01:47:06,296 --> 01:47:10,384
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1041
01:47:10,592 --> 01:47:15,138
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1042
01:47:15,347 --> 01:47:17,808
Here's a pretty thing.

1043
01:47:18,225 --> 01:47:19,518
Mithril.

1044
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:24,690
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1045
01:47:24,898 --> 01:47:28,151
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1046
01:47:31,697 --> 01:47:33,156
Oh!

1047
01:47:36,201 --> 01:47:38,245
My old ring.

1048
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:43,417
I should very much like...

1049
01:47:43,667 --> 01:47:47,671
...to hold it again, one last time.

1050
01:48:05,022 --> 01:48:08,692
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1051
01:48:09,026 --> 01:48:13,155
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1052
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:20,704
I'm sorry for everything.

1053
01:48:35,761 --> 01:48:39,931
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1054
01:48:41,266 --> 01:48:43,894
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1055
01:48:44,102 --> 01:48:47,230
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1056
01:48:50,692 --> 01:48:53,236
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1057
01:48:53,695 --> 01:48:57,616
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1058
01:48:58,158 --> 01:49:00,744
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1059
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:07,918
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1060
01:49:26,353 --> 01:49:28,855
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1061
01:49:29,398 --> 01:49:31,233
Left.

1062
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:55,150
<i>We must hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1063
01:50:55,358 --> 01:50:59,112
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1064
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:02,866
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

1065
01:51:03,033 --> 01:51:06,870
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1066
01:51:08,705 --> 01:51:09,748
Move your feet.

1067
01:51:09,956 --> 01:51:11,476
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1068
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,876
Faster!

1069
01:51:14,252 --> 01:51:18,048
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1070
01:51:18,256 --> 01:51:21,009
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1071
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:24,554
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1072
01:51:25,222 --> 01:51:29,059
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1073
01:51:29,392 --> 01:51:34,773
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1074
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:45,075
Sorry!

1075
01:51:45,909 --> 01:51:47,410
Get him!

1076
01:51:48,745 --> 01:51:51,206
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1077
01:51:51,748 --> 01:51:54,084
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1078
01:51:57,879 --> 01:51:59,599
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1079
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:02,592
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1080
01:52:02,842 --> 01:52:05,554
It's moving fast.

1081
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:07,931
Against the wind.

1082
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:10,850
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1083
01:52:11,059 --> 01:52:13,770
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1084
01:52:47,178 --> 01:52:48,930
Spies of Saruman.

1085
01:52:49,681 --> 01:52:52,976
The passage south is being watched.

1086
01:52:54,144 --> 01:52:57,480
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1087
01:53:10,118 --> 01:53:11,828
Frodo!

1088
01:53:30,805 --> 01:53:33,058
Boromir.

1089
01:53:33,308 --> 01:53:37,520
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1090
01:53:37,729 --> 01:53:40,857
...over so small a thing.

1091
01:53:44,069 --> 01:53:46,029
Such a little thing.

1092
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:47,697
Boromir!

1093
01:53:48,323 --> 01:53:51,034
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1094
01:54:00,835 --> 01:54:02,879
As you wish.

1095
01:54:03,588 --> 01:54:05,590
I care not.

1096
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,714
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1097
01:54:45,922 --> 01:54:50,510
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1098
01:54:51,803 --> 01:54:54,764
<i>If the mountain defeats you...

1099
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:59,436
<i>...will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1100
01:55:11,781 --> 01:55:14,659
There is a fell voice on the air.

1101
01:55:15,785 --> 01:55:17,287
It's Saruman!

1102
01:55:26,171 --> 01:55:30,842
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1103
01:55:31,134 --> 01:55:32,927
No!

1104
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:41,204
We must get off the mountain!

1105
01:56:41,704 --> 01:56:46,042
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1106
01:56:46,209 --> 01:56:49,546
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1107
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:53,466
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1108
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:56,553
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1109
01:56:58,388 --> 01:57:02,225
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1110
01:57:02,892 --> 01:57:07,897
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1111
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:13,611
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1112
01:57:14,904 --> 01:57:18,408
Shadow and flame.

1113
01:57:21,744 --> 01:57:24,414
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1114
01:57:29,127 --> 01:57:31,254
We cannot stay here!

1115
01:57:31,421 --> 01:57:34,257
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1116
01:57:34,424 --> 01:57:36,134
Frodo?

1117
01:57:39,137 --> 01:57:42,015
We will go through the mines.

1118
01:57:42,765 --> 01:57:44,642
So be it.

1119
01:57:51,316 --> 01:57:55,278
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1120
01:57:58,781 --> 01:58:00,992
How is your shoulder?

1121
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:04,454
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1122
01:58:05,997 --> 01:58:08,499
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1123
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,920
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1124
01:58:12,337 --> 01:58:16,257
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1125
01:58:16,424 --> 01:58:19,010
And, I fear, from within.

1126
01:58:21,638 --> 01:58:25,808
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1127
01:58:25,975 --> 01:58:28,853
Trust your own strengths.

1128
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:31,606
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1129
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:33,858
...for good or for evil.

1130
01:58:34,025 --> 01:58:36,319
Some are greater than I am.

1131
01:58:36,861 --> 01:58:40,490
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1132
01:58:41,866 --> 01:58:43,242
The walls...

1133
01:58:43,952 --> 01:58:46,037
...of Moria.

1134
01:58:51,751 --> 01:58:54,754
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1135
01:58:54,963 --> 01:58:59,384
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1136
01:58:59,759 --> 01:59:02,261
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1137
01:59:10,269 --> 01:59:13,564
Well, let's see.

1138
01:59:13,773 --> 01:59:15,149
Ithildin.

1139
01:59:15,775 --> 01:59:19,153
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1140
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:37,296
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1141
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:42,510
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1142
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:47,515
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1143
02:00:11,247 --> 02:00:12,415
Nothing's happening.

1144
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:23,634
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1145
02:00:23,968 --> 02:00:26,763
...Men and Orcs.

1146
02:00:27,055 --> 02:00:28,295
What are you going to do, then?

1147
02:00:28,473 --> 02:00:30,725
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1148
02:00:30,975 --> 02:00:32,935
And if that does not shatter them...

1149
02:00:33,144 --> 02:00:35,855
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1150
02:00:36,022 --> 02:00:39,484
...I will try to find the opening words.

1151
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:54,874
Mines are no place for a pony.

1152
02:00:55,083 --> 02:00:59,170
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1153
02:01:00,338 --> 02:01:03,132
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1154
02:01:03,674 --> 02:01:07,220
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1155
02:01:14,018 --> 02:01:16,604
Do not disturb the water.

1156
02:01:16,813 --> 02:01:18,689
Oh, it's useless.

1157
02:01:31,369 --> 02:01:33,538
It's a riddle.

1158
02:01:36,290 --> 02:01:39,418
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1159
02:01:39,794 --> 02:01:42,713
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1160
02:01:44,173 --> 02:01:45,508
<i>Mellon.

1161
02:02:03,526 --> 02:02:08,406
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1162
02:02:08,865 --> 02:02:14,579
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1163
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:19,167
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1164
02:02:19,542 --> 02:02:21,919
And they call it a mine.

1165
02:02:22,128 --> 02:02:24,088
A mine!

1166
02:02:25,131 --> 02:02:28,467
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1167
02:02:32,722 --> 02:02:34,182
No.

1168
02:02:34,599 --> 02:02:36,184
No...

1169
02:02:37,435 --> 02:02:39,103
No!

1170
02:02:41,731 --> 02:02:43,274
Goblins.

1171
02:02:47,195 --> 02:02:51,490
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1172
02:02:52,575 --> 02:02:55,119
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1173
02:02:57,914 --> 02:03:00,291
- Frodo!
- Help!

1174
02:03:00,499 --> 02:03:02,126
Strider!

1175
02:03:02,293 --> 02:03:05,087
- Help!
- Get off him!

1176
02:03:05,254 --> 02:03:06,297
Aragorn!

1177
02:03:16,724 --> 02:03:17,767
Frodo!

1178
02:03:18,935 --> 02:03:20,519
Strider!

1179
02:03:44,126 --> 02:03:45,169
Into the mines!

1180
02:03:45,336 --> 02:03:48,547
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1181
02:03:52,843 --> 02:03:54,637
Run!

1182
02:04:11,487 --> 02:04:15,074
We now have but one choice.

1183
02:04:15,283 --> 02:04:20,162
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1184
02:04:20,413 --> 02:04:22,373
Be on your guard.

1185
02:04:22,581 --> 02:04:26,043
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1186
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:29,755
...in the deep places of the world.

1187
02:04:37,722 --> 02:04:41,684
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1188
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:45,688
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1189
02:05:31,484 --> 02:05:35,196
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1190
02:05:35,363 --> 02:05:37,782
...or jewels...

1191
02:05:37,948 --> 02:05:40,993
...but mithril.

1192
02:05:59,345 --> 02:06:04,266
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1193
02:06:04,475 --> 02:06:08,437
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1194
02:06:08,604 --> 02:06:10,523
I never told him...

1195
02:06:10,689 --> 02:06:15,653
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1196
02:06:27,998 --> 02:06:29,708
Pippin.

1197
02:06:50,396 --> 02:06:53,023
I have no memory of this place.

1198
02:06:55,109 --> 02:06:56,610
- Are we lost?
- No.

1199
02:06:56,819 --> 02:06:59,321
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1200
02:06:59,488 --> 02:07:00,948
- Merry?
- What?

1201
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:03,200
I'm hungry.

1202
02:07:14,503 --> 02:07:18,966
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1203
02:07:19,175 --> 02:07:23,304
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1204
02:07:23,512 --> 02:07:27,683
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1205
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:30,019
...or was set loose.

1206
02:07:30,519 --> 02:07:34,190
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1207
02:07:36,817 --> 02:07:39,528
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1208
02:07:39,695 --> 02:07:45,493
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1209
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:50,539
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1210
02:07:50,706 --> 02:07:56,670
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1211
02:07:57,546 --> 02:08:00,382
Before it drove him mad.

1212
02:08:00,674 --> 02:08:03,552
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1213
02:08:03,719 --> 02:08:04,929
Pity?

1214
02:08:06,013 --> 02:08:08,891
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1215
02:08:09,808 --> 02:08:15,022
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1216
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:18,901
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1217
02:08:21,362 --> 02:08:25,324
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1218
02:08:25,533 --> 02:08:28,410
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1219
02:08:29,036 --> 02:08:34,917
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1220
02:08:35,751 --> 02:08:38,587
...before this is over.

1221
02:08:40,089 --> 02:08:43,926
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1222
02:08:50,599 --> 02:08:53,936
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1223
02:08:55,396 --> 02:08:57,439
I wish none of this had happened.

1224
02:08:57,606 --> 02:09:02,653
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1225
02:09:03,445 --> 02:09:08,951
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1226
02:09:10,452 --> 02:09:14,456
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1227
02:09:14,873 --> 02:09:17,293
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1228
02:09:17,793 --> 02:09:22,131
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1229
02:09:22,298 --> 02:09:25,467
And that is an encouraging thought.

1230
02:09:28,429 --> 02:09:29,597
Ah!

1231
02:09:30,389 --> 02:09:32,308
It's that way.

1232
02:09:32,474 --> 02:09:34,810
- He's remembered.
- No.

1233
02:09:34,977 --> 02:09:38,814
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1234
02:09:38,981 --> 02:09:44,194
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1235
02:09:59,001 --> 02:10:03,172
Let me risk a little more light.

1236
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:09,928
Behold...

1237
02:10:10,346 --> 02:10:15,559
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1238
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:21,482
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1239
02:10:46,382 --> 02:10:48,092
Gimli!

1240
02:10:53,889 --> 02:10:55,349
No.

1241
02:10:55,557 --> 02:10:57,184
No!

1242
02:10:59,728 --> 02:11:02,898
Oh, no.

1243
02:11:04,733 --> 02:11:06,026
No.

1244
02:11:13,283 --> 02:11:15,285
"Here lies Balin...

1245
02:11:15,744 --> 02:11:17,746
...son of Fundin...

1246
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:20,708
...Lord of Moria."

1247
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:23,419
He is dead, then.

1248
02:11:25,587 --> 02:11:26,797
It's as I feared.

1249
02:11:45,107 --> 02:11:48,026
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1250
02:11:48,235 --> 02:11:52,948
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1251
02:11:54,032 --> 02:11:56,618
We have barred the gates...

1252
02:11:57,286 --> 02:11:59,788
...but cannot hold them for long.

1253
02:11:59,955 --> 02:12:02,791
The ground shakes.

1254
02:12:03,167 --> 02:12:04,793
Drums...

1255
02:12:05,127 --> 02:12:08,547
...drums in the deep.

1256
02:12:12,092 --> 02:12:14,136
We cannot get out.

1257
02:12:16,138 --> 02:12:19,975
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1258
02:12:21,643 --> 02:12:24,188
We cannot get out.

1259
02:12:27,191 --> 02:12:29,151
They are coming."

1260
02:13:12,194 --> 02:13:14,029
Fool of a Took!

1261
02:13:14,363 --> 02:13:18,200
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1262
02:13:44,142 --> 02:13:45,769
Frodo!

1263
02:13:48,063 --> 02:13:49,565
Orcs.

1264
02:13:56,572 --> 02:13:58,574
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1265
02:14:05,873 --> 02:14:07,666
They have a cave-troll.

1266
02:14:23,432 --> 02:14:24,600
Let them come!

1267
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:28,687
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1268
02:16:47,576 --> 02:16:50,328
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1269
02:16:55,083 --> 02:16:56,752
Frodo!

1270
02:17:30,285 --> 02:17:32,120
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1271
02:17:33,121 --> 02:17:34,998
Frodo!

1272
02:18:20,168 --> 02:18:22,045
Frodo!

1273
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,299
Frodo!

1274
02:19:22,272 --> 02:19:23,565
Oh, no.

1275
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:33,867
He's alive.

1276
02:19:36,286 --> 02:19:39,289
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1277
02:19:39,581 --> 02:19:41,791
You should be dead.

1278
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,502
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1279
02:19:44,753 --> 02:19:49,507
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1280
02:19:55,305 --> 02:19:56,431
Mithril.

1281
02:19:59,226 --> 02:20:01,811
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1282
02:20:07,817 --> 02:20:09,778
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1283
02:20:24,751 --> 02:20:26,336
This way!

1284
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:39,743
What is this new devilry?

1285
02:21:55,842 --> 02:21:58,636
A Balrog.

1286
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:02,057
A demon of the ancient world.

1287
02:22:04,267 --> 02:22:06,728
This foe is beyond any of you.

1288
02:22:07,896 --> 02:22:09,439
Run!

1289
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:18,281
Quickly!

1290
02:22:34,923 --> 02:22:36,174
Gandalf.

1291
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:38,426
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1292
02:22:39,803 --> 02:22:42,305
The bridge is near.

1293
02:22:44,391 --> 02:22:48,478
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1294
02:23:17,632 --> 02:23:19,342
Gandalf!

1295
02:23:37,652 --> 02:23:38,862
Merry! Pippin!

1296
02:23:49,998 --> 02:23:51,499
Sam!

1297
02:23:54,252 --> 02:23:57,505
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1298
02:24:00,508 --> 02:24:01,968
Not the beard!

1299
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:17,066
Steady.

1300
02:24:19,194 --> 02:24:20,862
Hold on!

1301
02:24:41,883 --> 02:24:43,092
Hang on!

1302
02:24:53,895 --> 02:24:55,605
Lean forward!

1303
02:24:58,566 --> 02:24:59,609
Steady.

1304
02:25:00,944 --> 02:25:02,111
Come on!

1305
02:25:02,362 --> 02:25:03,863
Now!

1306
02:25:21,089 --> 02:25:22,882
Over the bridge!

1307
02:25:23,091 --> 02:25:24,634
Fly!

1308
02:26:09,304 --> 02:26:11,347
You cannot pass!

1309
02:26:11,514 --> 02:26:13,141
Gandalf!

1310
02:26:17,395 --> 02:26:22,275
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1311
02:26:23,276 --> 02:26:27,030
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1312
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,000
Go back to the Shadow.

1313
02:26:46,841 --> 02:26:51,304
You shall not pass!

1314
02:27:18,456 --> 02:27:22,335
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1315
02:27:30,009 --> 02:27:32,470
Fly, you fools!

1316
02:27:36,599 --> 02:27:38,768
No!

1317
02:27:44,899 --> 02:27:47,068
Aragorn!

1318
02:28:44,333 --> 02:28:47,170
Legolas, get them up.

1319
02:28:51,299 --> 02:28:53,134
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1320
02:28:53,301 --> 02:28:56,929
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1321
02:28:57,138 --> 02:29:00,475
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1322
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:04,645
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1323
02:29:06,147 --> 02:29:08,357
On your feet, Sam.

1324
02:29:08,691 --> 02:29:10,193
Frodo?

1325
02:29:12,278 --> 02:29:13,988
Frodo!

1326
02:30:06,499 --> 02:30:09,043
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1327
02:30:09,752 --> 02:30:13,881
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1328
02:30:14,131 --> 02:30:16,676
An Elf-witch...

1329
02:30:17,218 --> 02:30:20,054
...of terrible power.

1330
02:30:20,638 --> 02:30:22,849
All who look upon her...

1331
02:30:23,057 --> 02:30:24,851
...fall under her spell.

1332
02:30:25,059 --> 02:30:26,352
<i>Frodo!

1333
02:30:28,604 --> 02:30:30,648
And are never seen again.

1334
02:30:30,857 --> 02:30:35,361
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1335
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:39,240
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1336
02:30:39,448 --> 02:30:41,242
Mr. Frodo?

1337
02:30:46,539 --> 02:30:52,086
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1338
02:30:52,295 --> 02:30:56,883
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1339
02:31:04,557 --> 02:31:09,103
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1340
02:31:27,288 --> 02:31:29,582
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1341
02:31:29,749 --> 02:31:31,626
Speak words we can all understand!

1342
02:31:31,792 --> 02:31:36,422
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1343
02:31:36,714 --> 02:31:39,216
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1344
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:48,100
That was not so courteous.

1345
02:31:54,649 --> 02:31:58,653
You bring great evil with you.

1346
02:32:00,446 --> 02:32:02,657
You can go no further.

1347
02:32:39,902 --> 02:32:42,530
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1348
02:32:43,698 --> 02:32:45,574
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1349
02:32:47,076 --> 02:32:50,413
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1350
02:32:51,288 --> 02:32:54,375
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1351
02:32:57,378 --> 02:32:59,380
You will follow me.

1352
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,060
Caras Galadhon.

1353
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:16,689
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1354
02:33:16,856 --> 02:33:22,528
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1355
02:34:41,524 --> 02:34:44,652
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1356
02:34:45,319 --> 02:34:50,491
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1357
02:34:52,201 --> 02:34:56,664
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1358
02:34:56,914 --> 02:34:58,707
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1359
02:34:58,916 --> 02:35:02,002
For I much desire to speak with him.

1360
02:35:02,169 --> 02:35:05,005
I can no longer see him from afar.

1361
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:11,011
Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1362
02:35:11,303 --> 02:35:13,722
He has fallen into Shadow.

1363
02:35:18,435 --> 02:35:22,940
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1364
02:35:24,567 --> 02:35:28,320
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1365
02:35:29,029 --> 02:35:32,366
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1366
02:35:34,535 --> 02:35:37,746
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1367
02:35:38,372 --> 02:35:41,709
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1368
02:35:46,463 --> 02:35:50,759
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1369
02:35:51,051 --> 02:35:53,387
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1370
02:35:54,388 --> 02:35:57,892
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1371
02:35:59,393 --> 02:36:02,062
...and in all lands...

1372
02:36:02,229 --> 02:36:05,733
...love is now mingled with grief.

1373
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:21,081
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1374
02:36:21,582 --> 02:36:24,585
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1375
02:36:27,588 --> 02:36:30,883
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1376
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:34,094
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1377
02:36:34,887 --> 02:36:37,723
...to the ruin of all.

1378
02:36:42,061 --> 02:36:47,900
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1379
02:36:49,443 --> 02:36:54,114
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1380
02:36:54,615 --> 02:36:58,285
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1381
02:37:00,537 --> 02:37:02,623
Tonight, you will sleep...

1382
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:06,252
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1383
02:37:07,795 --> 02:37:09,630
<i>...one who has seen the Eye!

1384
02:37:24,270 --> 02:37:26,814
A lament for Gandalf.

1385
02:37:34,113 --> 02:37:35,656
What do they say about him?

1386
02:37:35,864 --> 02:37:38,492
I have not the heart to tell you.

1387
02:37:41,287 --> 02:37:43,497
For me, the grief is still too near.

1388
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:49,336
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1389
02:37:49,503 --> 02:37:52,506
There should be a verse about them.

1390
02:37:56,093 --> 02:37:58,095
<i>The finest rockets ever seen

1391
02:37:59,179 --> 02:38:02,016
<i>They burst in stars of blue and green

1392
02:38:02,975 --> 02:38:06,395
<i>Or after thunder, silver showers

1393
02:38:08,856 --> 02:38:11,692
<i>Came falling like a rain of flowers

1394
02:38:11,859 --> 02:38:15,738
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1395
02:38:26,540 --> 02:38:29,209
Take some rest.

1396
02:38:29,418 --> 02:38:32,129
These borders are well-protected.

1397
02:38:32,338 --> 02:38:34,882
I will find no rest here.

1398
02:38:37,718 --> 02:38:40,721
I heard her voice inside my head.

1399
02:38:40,929 --> 02:38:44,683
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1400
02:38:44,892 --> 02:38:50,356
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1401
02:38:51,732 --> 02:38:54,568
But I cannot see it.

1402
02:38:55,903 --> 02:38:58,405
It is long since we had any hope.

1403
02:39:08,582 --> 02:39:10,709
My father is a noble man.

1404
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:13,712
But his rule is failing...

1405
02:39:14,046 --> 02:39:19,426
...and our people lose faith.

1406
02:39:20,886 --> 02:39:24,431
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1407
02:39:24,598 --> 02:39:28,102
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1408
02:39:30,938 --> 02:39:33,941
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1409
02:39:34,608 --> 02:39:36,610
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1410
02:39:36,777 --> 02:39:40,614
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1411
02:39:41,281 --> 02:39:44,785
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1412
02:39:47,704 --> 02:39:49,665
Have you ever been called home...

1413
02:39:49,832 --> 02:39:53,794
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1414
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:57,631
I have seen the White City...

1415
02:39:57,965 --> 02:39:59,466
...long ago.

1416
02:40:00,467 --> 02:40:05,431
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1417
02:40:06,348 --> 02:40:09,309
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1418
02:40:09,768 --> 02:40:13,105
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1419
02:41:20,297 --> 02:41:22,841
Will you look into the mirror?

1420
02:41:23,008 --> 02:41:24,551
What will I see?

1421
02:41:27,513 --> 02:41:29,848
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1422
02:41:30,724 --> 02:41:32,559
For the mirror...

1423
02:41:32,809 --> 02:41:35,354
...shows many things.

1424
02:41:38,357 --> 02:41:40,734
Things that were...

1425
02:41:40,943 --> 02:41:43,529
...things that are...

1426
02:41:44,321 --> 02:41:46,240
...and some things...

1427
02:41:49,826 --> 02:41:53,121
...that have not yet come to pass.

1428
02:43:15,662 --> 02:43:18,498
I know what it is you saw.

1429
02:43:20,959 --> 02:43:23,462
For it is also in my mind.

1430
02:43:25,213 --> 02:43:29,301
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1431
02:43:31,678 --> 02:43:36,516
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1432
02:43:37,184 --> 02:43:40,479
<i>He will try to take the Ring.

1433
02:43:40,687 --> 02:43:42,689
<i>You know of whom I speak.

1434
02:43:43,690 --> 02:43:48,362
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.

1435
02:43:49,863 --> 02:43:52,324
<i>If you ask it of me...

1436
02:43:52,699 --> 02:43:55,744
<i>...I will give you the One Ring.

1437
02:43:56,828 --> 02:43:58,997
You offer it to me freely.

1438
02:44:03,543 --> 02:44:07,506
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1439
02:44:13,887 --> 02:44:17,182
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1440
02:44:17,599 --> 02:44:21,395
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1441
02:44:22,062 --> 02:44:25,065
Treacherous as the sea!

1442
02:44:25,565 --> 02:44:30,529
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1443
02:44:30,987 --> 02:44:33,365
All shall love me...

1444
02:44:33,573 --> 02:44:36,410
...and despair.

1445
02:44:50,507 --> 02:44:54,803
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1446
02:44:55,095 --> 02:44:57,556
...and go into the West...

1447
02:44:57,764 --> 02:45:02,227
- ...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1448
02:45:05,814 --> 02:45:09,943
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1449
02:45:10,902 --> 02:45:12,404
...is to be alone.

1450
02:45:15,741 --> 02:45:18,452
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1451
02:45:18,660 --> 02:45:20,287
And I am its keeper.

1452
02:45:23,457 --> 02:45:27,127
This task was appointed to you.

1453
02:45:28,128 --> 02:45:31,047
And if you do not find a way...

1454
02:45:32,257 --> 02:45:34,259
...no one will.

1455
02:45:34,634 --> 02:45:37,804
Then I know what I must do.

1456
02:45:38,472 --> 02:45:39,639
It's just...

1457
02:45:42,934 --> 02:45:45,145
...I'm afraid to do it.

1458
02:45:48,648 --> 02:45:53,820
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1459
02:45:59,159 --> 02:46:04,873
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1460
02:46:05,665 --> 02:46:09,002
They were Elves once.

1461
02:46:10,170 --> 02:46:13,507
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1462
02:46:13,673 --> 02:46:16,843
...tortured and mutilated.

1463
02:46:17,177 --> 02:46:22,516
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1464
02:46:22,808 --> 02:46:24,643
And now...

1465
02:46:26,102 --> 02:46:27,979
...perfected.

1466
02:46:28,688 --> 02:46:31,858
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1467
02:46:33,819 --> 02:46:36,154
...whom do you serve?

1468
02:46:36,363 --> 02:46:38,865
Saruman!

1469
02:46:59,719 --> 02:47:03,181
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1470
02:47:03,390 --> 02:47:06,268
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1471
02:47:06,518 --> 02:47:09,396
You will taste Man-flesh!

1472
02:47:14,526 --> 02:47:18,238
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1473
02:47:18,405 --> 02:47:22,576
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1474
02:47:24,411 --> 02:47:25,704
Kill the others.

1475
02:47:44,890 --> 02:47:50,312
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1476
02:47:51,438 --> 02:47:55,275
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1477
02:48:02,449 --> 02:48:03,992
Lembas.

1478
02:48:04,242 --> 02:48:05,827
Elvish waybread.

1479
02:48:08,330 --> 02:48:11,333
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1480
02:48:17,797 --> 02:48:19,799
How many did you eat?

1481
02:48:19,966 --> 02:48:21,635
Four.

1482
02:48:27,432 --> 02:48:30,032
<i>Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1483
02:48:30,226 --> 02:48:34,314
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

1484
02:48:34,481 --> 02:48:36,983
<i>Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1485
02:48:37,233 --> 02:48:41,029
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1486
02:48:41,237 --> 02:48:46,326
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1487
02:48:59,005 --> 02:49:00,399
By river you have the chance...

1488
02:49:00,423 --> 02:49:03,635
...of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1489
02:49:20,902 --> 02:49:25,699
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1490
02:49:25,991 --> 02:49:29,494
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1491
02:49:34,874 --> 02:49:37,335
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1492
02:49:37,502 --> 02:49:40,714
They have already seen service in war.

1493
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:43,925
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1494
02:49:44,092 --> 02:49:47,387
<i>You will find your courage.

1495
02:49:49,305 --> 02:49:51,266
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1496
02:49:51,433 --> 02:49:54,019
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1497
02:49:54,185 --> 02:49:56,312
Thank you, my lady.

1498
02:49:58,106 --> 02:50:01,443
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1499
02:50:07,907 --> 02:50:10,910
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1500
02:50:11,077 --> 02:50:13,246
Nothing.

1501
02:50:13,872 --> 02:50:17,208
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1502
02:50:17,834 --> 02:50:23,048
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1503
02:50:30,096 --> 02:50:31,639
Actually...

1504
02:50:31,848 --> 02:50:33,433
There was one thing.

1505
02:50:34,267 --> 02:50:36,936
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1506
02:50:37,103 --> 02:50:39,939
<i>Stupid to ask.

1507
02:50:42,442 --> 02:50:44,611
<i>I have nothing greater to give...

1508
02:50:44,778 --> 02:50:48,364
...than the gift you already bear.

1509
02:51:14,015 --> 02:51:17,102
That choice is yet before her.

1510
02:51:17,685 --> 02:51:20,605
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1511
02:51:20,939 --> 02:51:26,778
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1512
02:51:26,945 --> 02:51:31,282
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1513
02:51:58,852 --> 02:52:02,021
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1514
02:52:02,188 --> 02:52:05,650
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1515
02:52:06,359 --> 02:52:08,695
...our most beloved star.

1516
02:52:17,871 --> 02:52:22,250
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1517
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:26,588
<i>...when all other lights go out.

1518
02:52:35,388 --> 02:52:38,558
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1519
02:52:39,225 --> 02:52:43,521
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1520
02:52:44,230 --> 02:52:47,567
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1521
02:52:47,859 --> 02:52:49,777
What was her gift?

1522
02:52:49,986 --> 02:52:54,908
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1523
02:52:55,700 --> 02:52:58,578
She gave me three.

1524
02:54:40,722 --> 02:54:44,183
Gollum.
He has tracked us since Moria.

1525
02:54:47,895 --> 02:54:51,024
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1526
02:54:51,232 --> 02:54:54,402
But he's too clever a waterman.

1527
02:54:55,236 --> 02:54:58,531
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1528
02:54:58,698 --> 02:55:00,992
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1529
02:55:01,159 --> 02:55:03,202
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1530
02:55:03,369 --> 02:55:06,497
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1531
02:55:06,664 --> 02:55:09,751
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1532
02:55:10,710 --> 02:55:13,713
- Mr. Frodo--
- I'm all right.

1533
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:15,048
But you're not.

1534
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:17,842
I'm here to help you.

1535
02:55:18,009 --> 02:55:19,719
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1536
02:55:25,683 --> 02:55:28,394
You can't help me, Sam.

1537
02:55:30,563 --> 02:55:32,273
Not this time.

1538
02:55:35,193 --> 02:55:37,278
Get some sleep.

1539
02:55:43,618 --> 02:55:45,745
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1540
02:55:46,245 --> 02:55:49,040
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1541
02:55:49,707 --> 02:55:51,918
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1542
02:55:52,251 --> 02:55:55,171
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1543
02:55:55,588 --> 02:55:57,590
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1544
02:55:59,467 --> 02:56:02,303
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1545
02:56:02,470 --> 02:56:05,473
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1546
02:56:05,681 --> 02:56:08,976
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1547
02:56:09,227 --> 02:56:11,437
But you will not see that.

1548
02:56:11,771 --> 02:56:13,189
You are afraid!

1549
02:56:13,439 --> 02:56:15,983
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1550
02:56:16,275 --> 02:56:19,737
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1551
02:56:22,115 --> 02:56:26,494
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1552
02:56:38,339 --> 02:56:39,715
Frodo.

1553
02:56:41,592 --> 02:56:43,094
The Argonath.

1554
02:56:46,514 --> 02:56:50,268
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1555
02:56:50,977 --> 02:56:52,937
My kin.

1556
02:58:11,891 --> 02:58:14,101
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1557
02:58:14,352 --> 02:58:16,896
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1558
02:58:17,104 --> 02:58:20,566
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1559
02:58:21,025 --> 02:58:24,862
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1560
02:58:25,029 --> 02:58:28,241
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1561
02:58:28,449 --> 02:58:31,577
And after that, it gets even better.

1562
02:58:31,953 --> 02:58:36,916
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1563
02:58:37,083 --> 02:58:38,459
That is our road.

1564
02:58:40,044 --> 02:58:43,256
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1565
02:58:43,464 --> 02:58:45,216
Recover my--

1566
02:58:48,219 --> 02:58:50,221
- We should leave now.
- No.

1567
02:58:50,388 --> 02:58:54,850
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1568
02:58:55,059 --> 02:58:58,479
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1569
02:58:58,729 --> 02:59:02,733
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1570
02:59:03,234 --> 02:59:07,405
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1571
02:59:09,407 --> 02:59:14,370
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1572
02:59:14,870 --> 02:59:16,581
Where's Frodo?

1573
02:59:42,189 --> 02:59:44,108
None of us should wander alone.

1574
02:59:45,484 --> 02:59:47,612
You, least of all.

1575
02:59:47,820 --> 02:59:50,281
So much depends on you.

1576
02:59:51,324 --> 02:59:53,284
Frodo?

1577
03:00:00,416 --> 03:00:02,960
I know why you seek solitude.

1578
03:00:03,669 --> 03:00:07,131
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1579
03:00:07,923 --> 03:00:10,968
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1580
03:00:12,511 --> 03:00:15,181
There are other ways, Frodo.

1581
03:00:15,431 --> 03:00:19,226
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1582
03:00:19,477 --> 03:00:23,230
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1583
03:00:23,481 --> 03:00:26,525
Warning? Against what?

1584
03:00:26,734 --> 03:00:28,861
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1585
03:00:29,070 --> 03:00:32,698
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1586
03:00:32,948 --> 03:00:36,702
- ...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1587
03:00:38,496 --> 03:00:41,832
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1588
03:00:43,376 --> 03:00:45,461
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1589
03:00:46,671 --> 03:00:50,341
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1590
03:00:52,176 --> 03:00:55,513
What chance do you think you have?

1591
03:00:55,680 --> 03:01:00,351
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1592
03:01:00,559 --> 03:01:04,271
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1593
03:01:06,399 --> 03:01:08,526
You fool!

1594
03:01:08,693 --> 03:01:12,697
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1595
03:01:12,863 --> 03:01:15,700
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1596
03:01:15,866 --> 03:01:17,201
- Give it to me!
- No!

1597
03:01:17,368 --> 03:01:19,203
- Give it to me!
- No.

1598
03:01:26,877 --> 03:01:28,879
I see your mind.

1599
03:01:29,088 --> 03:01:32,049
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1600
03:01:32,258 --> 03:01:34,135
You will betray us!

1601
03:01:34,385 --> 03:01:37,555
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1602
03:01:38,013 --> 03:01:41,642
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1603
03:01:48,733 --> 03:01:50,234
Frodo?

1604
03:01:54,572 --> 03:01:56,115
Frodo.

1605
03:02:00,077 --> 03:02:02,079
What have I done?

1606
03:02:02,288 --> 03:02:04,039
Please, Frodo.

1607
03:02:04,248 --> 03:02:06,917
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1608
03:02:07,126 --> 03:02:08,961
Frodo!

1609
03:02:55,466 --> 03:02:56,884
Frodo?

1610
03:02:58,135 --> 03:03:01,222
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1611
03:03:01,472 --> 03:03:03,224
Stay away!

1612
03:03:03,641 --> 03:03:05,226
Frodo!

1613
03:03:07,478 --> 03:03:11,315
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1614
03:03:20,991 --> 03:03:23,494
Would you destroy it?

1615
03:03:28,499 --> 03:03:30,417
<i>Aragorn.

1616
03:03:33,838 --> 03:03:36,173
<i>Aragorn.

1617
03:03:38,008 --> 03:03:39,844
<i>Elessar.

1618
03:03:47,518 --> 03:03:50,855
I would have gone with you to the end.

1619
03:03:51,522 --> 03:03:54,358
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1620
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:58,863
I know.

1621
03:04:01,365 --> 03:04:06,787
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1622
03:04:10,541 --> 03:04:12,251
Go, Frodo!

1623
03:04:15,254 --> 03:04:16,755
Run.

1624
03:04:17,047 --> 03:04:18,716
Run!

1625
03:04:43,240 --> 03:04:44,909
Mr. Frodo!

1626
03:04:54,209 --> 03:04:55,961
Find the halfling!

1627
03:04:57,588 --> 03:05:00,132
Find the halfling!

1628
03:05:03,594 --> 03:05:05,262
Elendil!

1629
03:05:11,769 --> 03:05:13,312
Aragorn, go!

1630
03:05:35,042 --> 03:05:36,335
Frodo!

1631
03:05:36,961 --> 03:05:38,545
Hide here. Quick!

1632
03:05:39,171 --> 03:05:40,631
Come on!

1633
03:05:43,133 --> 03:05:45,135
What's he doing?

1634
03:05:49,348 --> 03:05:51,350
He's leaving.

1635
03:05:56,146 --> 03:05:59,066
- No!
- Pippin!

1636
03:06:03,988 --> 03:06:06,323
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1637
03:06:06,865 --> 03:06:09,994
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1638
03:06:10,369 --> 03:06:11,996
- Over here!
- This way!

1639
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:25,175
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1640
03:07:20,564 --> 03:07:23,609
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1641
03:08:06,693 --> 03:08:07,820
Run!

1642
03:11:39,406 --> 03:11:41,033
No.

1643
03:11:44,870 --> 03:11:47,914
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1644
03:11:48,206 --> 03:11:50,334
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1645
03:11:52,210 --> 03:11:53,628
I let Frodo go.

1646
03:11:54,338 --> 03:11:56,882
Then you did what I could not.

1647
03:11:57,883 --> 03:12:01,219
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1648
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:06,058
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1649
03:12:06,224 --> 03:12:08,560
I did not see it.

1650
03:12:08,727 --> 03:12:11,897
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1651
03:12:12,397 --> 03:12:14,900
You fought bravely.

1652
03:12:15,233 --> 03:12:17,903
You have kept your honor.

1653
03:12:18,445 --> 03:12:20,405
Leave it.

1654
03:12:20,739 --> 03:12:22,741
It is over.

1655
03:12:23,950 --> 03:12:29,247
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1656
03:12:29,664 --> 03:12:32,667
...and my city to ruin.

1657
03:12:36,755 --> 03:12:39,424
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1658
03:12:39,591 --> 03:12:43,595
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1659
03:12:44,596 --> 03:12:47,099
...nor our people fail.

1660
03:12:48,100 --> 03:12:49,434
Our people.

1661
03:12:53,271 --> 03:12:55,440
Our people.

1662
03:13:17,129 --> 03:13:20,132
I would have followed you, my brother.

1663
03:13:21,716 --> 03:13:23,718
My captain.

1664
03:13:26,304 --> 03:13:28,306
My king.

1665
03:13:47,951 --> 03:13:50,162
Be at peace...

1666
03:13:50,495 --> 03:13:52,497
...son of Gondor.

1667
03:14:09,014 --> 03:14:12,350
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1668
03:14:12,851 --> 03:14:15,854
But he will not return.

1669
03:14:39,044 --> 03:14:41,046
Frodo!

1670
03:15:00,565 --> 03:15:03,818
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1671
03:15:05,070 --> 03:15:08,073
<i>I wish none of this had happened.

1672
03:15:11,076 --> 03:15:13,828
<i>So do all who live
to see such times...

1673
03:15:14,037 --> 03:15:17,457
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.

1674
03:15:17,624 --> 03:15:20,252
<i>All you have to decide...

1675
03:15:20,544 --> 03:15:25,257
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1676
03:15:54,119 --> 03:15:56,121
Frodo, no!

1677
03:15:56,663 --> 03:15:57,956
Frodo!

1678
03:15:58,790 --> 03:16:01,459
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1679
03:16:04,963 --> 03:16:06,965
Go back, Sam!

1680
03:16:07,465 --> 03:16:11,094
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1681
03:16:11,303 --> 03:16:14,139
And I'm coming with you!

1682
03:16:14,598 --> 03:16:16,975
You can't swim!

1683
03:16:20,812 --> 03:16:22,480
Sam!

1684
03:16:28,111 --> 03:16:29,404
Sam!

1685
03:17:10,362 --> 03:17:13,031
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1686
03:17:13,365 --> 03:17:17,702
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1687
03:17:18,870 --> 03:17:21,456
And I don't mean to.

1688
03:17:21,706 --> 03:17:23,875
I don't mean to.

1689
03:17:25,543 --> 03:17:27,379
Sam.

1690
03:17:42,227 --> 03:17:43,895
Come on.

1691
03:18:12,424 --> 03:18:16,928
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1692
03:18:31,776 --> 03:18:36,781
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1693
03:18:40,285 --> 03:18:45,123
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1694
03:18:56,968 --> 03:19:00,138
Not if we hold true to each other.

1695
03:19:01,473 --> 03:19:05,977
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1696
03:19:06,978 --> 03:19:12,275
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1697
03:19:13,485 --> 03:19:15,570
We travel light.

1698
03:19:15,779 --> 03:19:17,655
Let us hunt some Orc.

1699
03:19:20,658 --> 03:19:22,660
Yes!

1700
03:19:41,679 --> 03:19:43,097
Mordor.

1701
03:19:43,681 --> 03:19:47,101
I hope the others find a safer road.

1702
03:19:48,019 --> 03:19:50,605
Strider will look after them.

1703
03:19:51,523 --> 03:19:54,859
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1704
03:19:55,193 --> 03:19:57,695
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1705
03:19:57,862 --> 03:19:59,405
We may.

1706
03:20:01,533 --> 03:20:02,534
Sam...

1707
03:20:06,204 --> 03:20:08,832
...I'm glad you are with me.

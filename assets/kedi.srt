1
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,741
In Istanbul,
the cat is more than just a cat.

2
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,915
The cat embodies
the indescribable chaos,

3
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,168
the culture, and the uniqueness
that is the essence of Istanbul.

4
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:31,632
Without the cat,
Istanbul would lose a part of its soul

5
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:34,343
And there’s nothing
like it anywhere else on earth.

6
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:18,757
She’s a real hunter now.
She wasn’t like that before.

7
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,010
She changed after giving birth.

8
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,766
Before that, all she did was sleep.

9
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:27,767
Chilling here all day.

10
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,016
Sometimes I talk to her.
And she actually talks back.

11
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,852
She’s a solid character.

12
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,811
She’ll stubbornly stand there.

13
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,191
You’ll tell her to leave.
She won't, she’ll just stare.

14
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,566
"I’m not leaving," she’ll say,
"where are you kicking me out to?"

15
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,277
"I’ll be back anyway."

16
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,572
"What are you trying to do, wise guy?"

17
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,283
She’s really, you know, strong-willed.

18
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,788
She’s got personality.

19
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:35,335
Some cats really have character,
you can tell from their faces.

20
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,932
I think it’s wrong
to trap them in a house...

21
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,560
just so we can pet them.

22
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,103
There are millions of them out
there, we pet them all we want.

23
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,109
What matters is being on
the same frequency as them.

24
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,901
To communicate with them.

25
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:04,029
Besides, they can tell...
who likes them and who doesn’t.

26
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,365
They notice.

27
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,368
And they give off good energy.

28
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,371
They absorb all your negative energy.

29
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,210
We’re lucky. They do me good.

30
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,088
It’s that time again.

31
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,257
Time to cruise. She comes and goes.

32
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,923
She came around one day.
I knew she'd been pregnant.

33
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,632
It was obvious she had given birth.

34
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,929
She led me to the back,
to show me her kittens.

35
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,221
It’s so fascinating...

36
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,014
they’re just like people.

37
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,074
The love of animals
is a different kind of love.

38
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,245
People who don’t love animals
can’t love people either.

39
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,121
I know that much.

40
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,802
Bengü!

41
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,557
Bengü!

42
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,769
Come. Come, girl.

43
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,663
She was one of four kittens.

44
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:27,626
She was the scrawniest one. And the ugliest.

45
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,462
The other three left, she stayed.

46
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,341
Sometimes she makes me angry.

47
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,552
But why? I’ve never thought about it.

48
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,012
I guess I must be in a bad mood.

49
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,306
But I never hit her or anything.

50
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,977
I tell her to leave but she never does.
She walks to the door and comes back.

51
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,987
Bengü has been with us eight or nine years.

52
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,699
She came here as a kitten… and never left.

53
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,995
Bengü loves to be loved. Honestly.

54
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,582
She loves it when
you pet her – she nearly passes out.

55
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:27,519
It’s not the kind of
sappiness from old Turkish movies...

56
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,355
but I do look for her.

57
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,940
If I don’t see her, or hear her voice…

58
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,652
if she’s not around
when I get here in the morning…

59
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:37,149
I get worried and look for her.

60
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,279
Maybe she is like a child.

61
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,742
People miss their kids, right? I miss her.

62
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,539
Bengü is very delicate.

63
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,543
If you pet another cat,
she’ll get jealous and sulk.

64
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,547
She’s very sensitive, Bengü.

65
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,591
That’s it, that’s the spot.

66
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,218
That’s the spot.

67
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,763
She’s done for. And then here.

68
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,722
And here.

69
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,190
Look at her delight.

70
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,401
You really know how to live.

71
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,913
Bengü has given birth
but I haven’t seen where.

72
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,087
Try attacking her kittens
and you’ll see another side of her.

73
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:33,646
I’ve heard they'd always
keep a cat on board a ship.

74
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:37,817
To absorb your excess energy.
I know soil does the same thing.

75
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,193
Prayer beads do the trick for me.

76
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,739
This cat is good for me too.

77
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,034
Besides, we’ve gotten used to her.

78
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,411
She’s become one of us.

79
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,664
Coming and going unconditionally.

80
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,542
And endless conversations too.

81
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,758
THESE CUPS ARE FOR CATS AND DOGS.

82
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,679
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO BE DESPERATE
FOR A CUP OF WATER IN THE NEXT LIFE...

83
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,182
DON’T TOUCH THESE CUPS.

84
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,143
They can’t just fly away like birds.

85
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,939
It’s our responsibility
to take care of them as best as we can.

86
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,702
It is said that
cats are aware of God’s existence…

87
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,706
but that dogs are not.

88
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,543
Dogs think people are God, but cats don’t.

89
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:42,090
Cats know that people act
as middlemen to God’s will.

90
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,716
They’re not ungrateful, they just know better.

91
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:28,301
Petting a cat gives me
a peculiar sense of security.

92
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,598
Even though
we don’t speak each other’s language...

93
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:35,183
we immediately form a shared language.

94
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:38,604
I imagine having a relationship with cats

95
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,482
must be a lot like
being friends with aliens.

96
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:46,111
You make contact
with a very different life form…

97
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,780
open a line
of communication with one another...

98
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,699
and start a dialogue.

99
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,013
And they’re
very foreign to us, very different.

100
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,807
Whether physically, mentally, or in capacity

101
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,559
they’re very different.

102
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,998
Yet, we’re able to have
a relationship with them.

103
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,049
Of course
I can’t take the place of their mother…

104
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:13,591
but I do what I can.

105
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,729
I wonder if I should feed them again.

106
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,108
Alright, alright, I’m gonna feed you.

107
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,528
When they’re full, they don’t make a peep.

108
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,325
They’re really hungry.

109
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,706
Someone dumped them over by the shops.
Then they brought them over here.

110
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,544
Relying on me being here.

111
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:55,800
I had an incident with a cat,
it’ll shock you if I tell you.

112
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,887
About fifteen years ago

113
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,933
my boat was docked
over there, it sank in a storm.

114
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:07,500
I had barely managed to pay for it.

115
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:08,939
Sold whatever I had.

116
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,608
But got the boat.

117
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,903
I barely had it a week and the boat sinks.

118
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:17,823
Then, I’m walking over by the rocks there…

119
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,493
it’s extraordinary
what I’m about to tell you.

120
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:26,374
I’m walking along, I see this
cat, pointing me to a wallet.

121
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:30,294
A cat the same color as this one – no lie.

122
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,171
Exactly that color.

123
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,548
Meow, meow!
I thought, what’s up with this cat?

124
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,218
Does it have rabies or something?

125
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:37,218
I was a bit scared.

126
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,764
So I went to have some tea.

127
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:41,764
But something kept
bothering me to get the wallet.

128
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,973
Even the tea guy asked if I was OK.

129
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:46,810
I said, I don’t know,
something strange is going on.

130
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,980
I got up, took a look inside the wallet…

131
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,360
I swear, I needed 120 lira…
and there was 120 lira inside that wallet.

132
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,155
Whoever doesn’t believe this
story is a heathen in my books.

133
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,366
Can you imagine? God Almighty.

134
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,537
What is that if not a godsend?

135
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,872
That’s how my love for animals began.

136
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:11,669
After I found that wallet,
I started caring for cats.

137
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,882
But taking care of cats isn't easy.

138
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,429
I have to give them milk,
if I’m gonna keep them alive.

139
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,182
These guys are quite big, they should survive.

140
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,852
But neglect them for
a couple of days, they’d surely die.

141
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,941
They survived in that box
because it’s warm in there.

142
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,610
And that chubby one
came along and became a mother to them.

143
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,865
He keeps them warm.
I guess they think he’s their mother too.

144
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,032
Both a father and a mother.

145
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,994
He’s both a father and a mother to them.

146
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:50,124
- You have two children at home, right?
- Yes, I have two.

147
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,543
So you know what it’s like to be a parent.

148
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,210
Oh, it’s tough.

149
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,557
Whether we like it or not,
there are rats that live here by the sea.

150
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:58,187
And because we’re people,
we don’t give them space to live.

151
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:01,939
But admittedly, they are a pest...

152
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,942
and it’s not good for them
to be around where people eat.

153
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,535
We considered rat poison,
we’ve used that in the past.

154
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,748
But just when we decided
to let the rats die on their own…

155
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,585
this little lion of a cat showed up.

156
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:28,591
He takes care of them at
night, as nature dictates.

157
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:29,444
We didn't tell him to hunt the rats,
he took it upon himself.

158
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,990
To tell you the truth, he earns his keep.

159
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,162
You know the saying,
"do justice to one’s love"?

160
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,874
That’s what he does.
He does justice to the love he gets.

161
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,042
We’re grateful to him.

162
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,935
Life is beautiful.

163
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,771
If you know how to live.

164
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,107
You can love if your heart is open.

165
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:56,073
Everything is beautiful
when you look at it with love.

166
00:26:56,073 --> 00:27:02,371
If you can enjoy
the presence of a cat, a bird, a flower…

167
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,416
what can I say,
all the world will be yours.

168
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,946
She is the toughest of all the females.

169
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:39,991
Trouble for all the fishermen.

170
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,326
A fish thief.

171
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,746
Arch enemy of the dogs.

172
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,083
She’ll chase any of them, even pit bulls.

173
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,509
She's the neighborhood psychopath.

174
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,939
She doesn’t like soft love.

175
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,361
She likes tough love.

176
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:34,421
She’ll start from the top of the church
and patrol the whole place.

177
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,132
She’s a very interesting animal.

178
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,011
The only thing she’ll steal is fish.

179
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,471
She’ll stand in front
of the fish vendors over there

180
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,266
refusing to leave
even if they shoo her away.

181
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,102
She won’t take anchovies
or mackerel either, she prefers bluefish.

182
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:53,522
Then she’ll make
the fishermen chase her all the way here.

183
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,078
She likes to live a life of luxury.

184
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:13,376
She even makes her husband respect her.

185
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,545
She chases him off.

186
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,770
She’s leaving so he can eat.

187
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,861
Now, Osman Pasha gets his turn.

188
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,400
She doesn’t want to
lose him to anyone else either.

189
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:24,239
Girls prettier than Psycho
have come around, right?

190
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,076
There’s an instinctive jealousy.

191
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,970
She’s like a vicious housewife.

192
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,598
A jealous housewife
who doesn’t leave her husband alone.

193
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,562
And doesn’t let
anyone else near him either.

194
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:20,921
She comes around
when she wants to be loved.

195
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,215
Gets her fill of love and leaves.

196
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:29,721
But I can’t do as I please.

197
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,722
I grabbed her tail, she bit my hand.

198
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:35,810
But she does as she wishes.

199
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,687
That’s very important to me.

200
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:44,069
That she never compromises her freedom.

201
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:49,074
She has a fighting spirit.

202
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,867
That’s what I like.

203
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:57,374
She has qualities that people should have.

204
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,111
Their posture feels very feminine to me.

205
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,949
I don’t see that elegance in women anymore.

206
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,826
We’ve lost that,
but cats carry themselves so well.

207
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:47,757
Especially in this country,
in a city like this...

208
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:51,344
it’s very difficult
to be a woman, to be female.

209
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:56,057
To express your femininity,
to be defiant with your femininity.

210
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:03,772
Being female…

211
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:06,442
and if you’re a "pretty little thing"…

212
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,695
you feel like you have
to account for all of it.

213
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:32,670
When you’re alone for long periods
your animal instincts get sharper.

214
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:33,677
I really believe that.

215
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,432
Maybe it’s a quality that
should be developed more in all of us.

216
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:41,185
As if it’s better to be so human, so modern.

217
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,231
There’s a power you can feel
within yourself, of a wild creature.

218
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,983
I think everyone needs
to discover that in themselves.

219
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:54,657
Cats are satisfied with their existence.

220
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,077
And they’re very sure of their character.

221
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,205
But it’s not enough for us.

222
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,206
We always want more.

223
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,541
That mentality poisons us
and destroys everything.

224
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:08,545
And maybe in the near
future, in two or three years

225
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:11,340
we may no longer see cats on these streets.

226
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,519
They all have personalities, like people.

227
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:48,312
If you look closely, we’re the same.

228
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,901
Some want affection,
others will tell you all their troubles.

229
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,986
Some are discreet,
won’t talk about anything.

230
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,322
Others are ambitious.

231
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,826
And some are pompous...

232
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,871
like a lady
who can’t be bothered to say hello.

233
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,668
Cats are exactly the same.

234
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:15,005
Some won’t even look when I call to them.

235
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,342
I believe they share
the same traits as people.

236
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,224
Deniz!

237
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,893
Deniz!

238
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:29,395
He was a tiny little thing.

239
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,856
He looked down at me from up there.

240
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,651
We wondered
where this beat-up little guy came from.

241
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,361
I brought him down from the roof.

242
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,989
Who knows where he came from.

243
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:44,618
Being a young male,
he attacked us at first.

244
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:52,710
A couple of months later,
he started approaching us for food.

245
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:59,634
Once we could stroke him, he was tamed.

246
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,099
Now he’s become a very friendly cat.

247
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:15,418
It all changed over the last
five years, when these buildings went up.

248
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,750
It used to be all green here.

249
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:25,762
There were orchards,
and gardens where they’d grow crops.

250
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,018
When these buildings went up,
it all disappeared – no nature left.

251
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,416
Oh dear.

252
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,920
Look at them, seven plump kittens!

253
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,883
These kittens...
it’ll be a shame if they tear this place down.

254
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,344
I don’t know what we’ll do.

255
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,221
This will be a major road.

256
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,349
They want to connect these buildings.

257
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:23,527
We’re more worried
about what’ll happen to the cats

258
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,529
than what might happen to us.

259
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,494
If this area gets demolished,
and that's likely, they won't have anyone.

260
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,380
At some point, they miss the streets.

261
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,548
They can find some earth out here.

262
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,384
To do their business.

263
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,346
It’s harder to do that
in a house with cat litter.

264
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,806
But out here they dig it up.

265
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,268
Oh no, where did he come from?

266
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,396
- An older cat got to him in the backyard.
- Oh sweetie.

267
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,649
- I immediately thought of you.
- What are we going to do with you?

268
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,902
You poor, poor thing.

269
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,244
Is he gone, I wonder. Is he dead?

270
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,510
He must have slammed him against
the ground… got attacked by a bigger cat.

271
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,929
It’s a fact of nature. It happens.

272
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,902
This one was my first child.

273
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,655
She was special
not only because she was my first

274
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,116
but also because she had great character.

275
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,868
She died of breast cancer.

276
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:43,041
I would dress her
to keep her from licking her wounds.

277
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,586
I tried very hard
to find a cat like her again...

278
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:50,967
but I came to realize that it
was futile, that she was one of a kind.

279
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,011
My longing for her...
let’s just say if there is afterlife,

280
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,597
I want to meet her again, not my grandmother.

281
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,858
We cook twenty pounds
of chicken every day.

282
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,570
We don’t feed them
dried cat food or anything artificial.

283
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:33,216
My therapist says I try to heal
my own wounds by healing theirs.

284
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,262
By feeding them
and tending to their needs.

285
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:43,394
My wounds must be so deeply rooted…

286
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:47,355
they still haven’t healed despite all this.

287
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,443
I guess I’ll heal when they heal.

288
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,370
There was a time
I had great difficulty dealing with death.

289
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:06,250
I accept death as a reality...

290
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,378
but I have difficulty
dealing with the longing.

291
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:12,380
That’s my problem with death.

292
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,559
Now we’ll go out
to distribute the morning meal.

293
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:30,065
This is our daily routine,
seven days a week, including Sundays.

294
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,112
Wait honey, wait.

295
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,784
Come, come my girl.

296
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,119
My little darlings.

297
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,960
Come, I’ve got your food!

298
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,097
There were sixty
but five died in the last two weeks.

299
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,432
And it’s always cancer.

300
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,980
We say it happens to people,
but it happens to animals too.

301
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,983
We eat and drink the same -
the same food, the same water.

302
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,327
We've raised a lot of cats.

303
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:28,791
Some grew old and died,
quite a few got run over.

304
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:34,255
We learned that something you
love can one day cease to exist.

305
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:39,719
We adopted a sense of stoicism that way.

306
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,722
We had a cat cemetery in the backyard.

307
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:46,517
My older brother and I would
bury them with great ceremony.

308
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:50,353
And because we’d see crosses in cowboy movies

309
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:53,773
like that last scene
in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

310
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:55,567
we thought they looked impressive.

311
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,821
We’re not Christian,
but they look cool in movies

312
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:03,659
and because we weren’t
about to engrave tiny gravestones

313
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,454
we’d make crosses out of twigs.

314
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,832
Then one day our father saw us
and freaked out over the crosses.

315
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:11,583
Immediately sent us to Qur’an school

316
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,628
so that we wouldn’t suddenly turn Christian.

317
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,380
We told him not to worry, obviously.

318
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:23,095
If I hadn’t had cats,
I would’ve had a very troubled childhood

319
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:26,681
because interacting
only with people is not enough…

320
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:29,184
and especially difficult with grown-ups.

321
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:40,237
I love cats who hang out in
vintage stores, "hmm the smell of paper"…

322
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,239
stretching out among old LPs.

323
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,409
It’s especially satisfying when I’m sketching

324
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,079
she sleeps in the drawer
like a vintage store cat.

325
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,373
I check the drawer once in a while…

326
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,250
"OK, she’s still asleep"…
And I carry on working.

327
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,460
Because drawing is such isolating work,

328
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,296
a sleeping cat can really give you comfort.

329
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:09,599
Any ungrateful behavior on their
part is really an act of sincerity.

330
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,935
They don’t need to apologize.

331
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,773
I guess there are people
who expect that from a cat.

332
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:20,193
"I gave you all that food
and you won’t even sit on my lap."

333
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:22,697
A relationship where they
expect a return on an investment.

334
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:37,836
Down the hill in Cihangir, there used
to be a big harbor during the Ottoman era.

335
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:42,340
Ships from Norway
and elsewhere would come with cargo.

336
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:48,054
Sailors would keep cats
on board to fend off rats.

337
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:50,348
As cargo was being unloaded,
cats would get off the boat

338
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,476
thinking that they’d made it to land.

339
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,479
And trek up to the top of the hill.

340
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:59,482
Later, they’d miss the boat
and begin life here in Cihangir.

341
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,527
Now, there are
countless kinds of cats in this area.

342
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:06,157
Norwegian cats,
and cats from all over the world.

343
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,615
There’s a lot of variety.

344
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:19,170
Later, the first Ottoman sewers
were built in this part of the city.

345
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:27,677
And giant rats would terrorize residents.

346
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:31,264
That’s why every house had a cat.

347
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:34,684
To fend off the giant sewer rats.

348
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,696
His name was "Milkman"
when he first showed up.

349
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:31,324
He’d come around to drink milk and leave.

350
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:35,663
He was barely a year old.
He hadn't been neutered.

351
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,581
Then he started showing up all beat up.

352
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,211
He got into fights
with other males over the ladies.

353
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,797
He got kicked one time and
showed up with a dislocated leg.

354
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,343
He was bitten by a dog and
showed up with a hole in his butt.

355
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,889
But it never ruins
his mood – he’s always happy.

356
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:59,728
A neighbor of mine started
calling him carefree, happy-go-lucky.

357
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,189
So the name Gamsiz – carefree – stuck.

358
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:10,322
Our vet Elif down the road
thought Gamsiz was in love with her.

359
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,534
Because at one point we were making
a trip to the vet every two weeks.

360
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,286
Constantly getting in trouble.

361
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:21,083
He’d have an accident, get hurt,
or develop a fungal infection.

362
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,920
For months,
we visited the vet every two weeks.

363
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,464
Once he spent a whole winter at the vet.

364
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,635
Doesn’t that get expensive?

365
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,640
I guess it does.
But we all have running tabs at the vet.

366
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,350
There’s a bunch of us in the neighborhood.

367
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:44,147
We have an open tab
at pretty much every vet.

368
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,945
We also collect donations
which help with these expenses.

369
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,159
Whatever is in our tip box goes to the cats.

370
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:21,559
Gamsiz is a bit of a thug.

371
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,605
He’s feisty,
the tough guy of the neighborhood.

372
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:38,786
But, if you wanted go out at night,
he’s the one you’d want to go out with.

373
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,579
He’s that guy. He’s fun.

374
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,384
There’s Laçin
across the street – he really likes her.

375
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,643
She’s told me that he comes
to her window and demands to be let in.

376
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,896
Or he’ll go up to the front door
if he wants to enter the building.

377
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:09,357
She says sometimes
he even spends the night.

378
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,070
When he wants sausages, he goes to Filiz.

379
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,990
Everyone offers something different…

380
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,784
but there are also the people
that cats choose for themselves.

381
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:21,577
Gamsiz has a wide range.

382
00:51:21,577 --> 00:51:26,791
I’m the main human in his life…
others are supporting actors.

383
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:41,014
Because I’m on the first floor,
it’s easy for cats to come up here.

384
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,729
My place has many visitors
but I try not to let them in

385
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,771
because I have a cat of my own.

386
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:51,900
Murat doesn’t take care of just one cat.

387
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,945
He cares for many
and knows all their characters.

388
00:51:55,945 --> 00:52:00,616
I met Gamsiz at the café,
he was lying on the couch.

389
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:06,123
And when I tried to sit down,
he smacked me. That’s how we met.

390
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,666
After that,
I smothered him with love, of course.

391
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,211
They take note of that immediately, you know.

392
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:16,967
They remember if you made a connection.

393
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:21,471
As a result, he came up here.
At first I didn’t let him in.

394
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,641
But unlike anyone else,
Gamsiz stands sideways.

395
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:26,184
Like this.

396
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,853
A single paw in the air.

397
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:33,483
He seems to be knocking like this.

398
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,987
He’s always like that.

399
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,865
Whereas all other cats,
including mine, stand facing forward.

400
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:45,329
But this guy, whether he comes
up to the front or back window

401
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,456
always has this sideways stance.

402
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,875
He strikes this charming pose.

403
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:55,506
And with that paw,
he somehow gets your attention.

404
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,966
If you ignore him,
he gets even more persistent.

405
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:03,806
Especially if you’re right
where he wants to come in

406
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:09,186
he gets really rowdy
and eventually forces you to let him in.

407
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,438
I respect him a lot because of that.

408
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,402
What’s really special
about him is that he’s a go-getter.

409
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,903
Once he makes up his mind about something...

410
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,490
let’s say he’s decided
to come here and eat Gece’s food

411
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,451
that’s his mission for the day.

412
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,121
There’s no stopping him.

413
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,876
Come, Gece!

414
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,592
OK, that’s enough. Everybody out.

415
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:52,270
Ginger is new to the neighborhood.
We’ve only recently started seeing him.

416
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:01,447
But he’s really determined
to take over the neighborhood.

417
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,132
He’s fighting over territory.

418
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,425
"My hood."

419
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:07,804
"I might be new here,
but I’m a cat of strength."

420
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,597
"I’m a cat of quality."

421
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:13,684
"You’ll see,
I’ll gain control of this territory."

422
00:55:13,684 --> 00:55:15,686
That’s his attitude.

423
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,405
That’s what I first admired about cats…

424
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,617
the way I admired superheroes
like Spiderman or Superman...

425
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,077
I believed cats had superpowers too.

426
00:56:55,536 --> 00:57:00,041
I never stopped being in awe of them.

427
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:09,593
Having nine lives,
or being able to land on all four feet…

428
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,428
If only we could land on all fours.

429
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:16,642
We land on two and they snap like twigs.

430
00:58:35,177 --> 00:58:36,846
I had to leave early yesterday.

431
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:40,517
I was sad I couldn’t bring enough food.

432
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:45,980
I couldn’t eat my dinner
with a clear conscience.

433
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,151
It’s overwhelming
when I think of them back there.

434
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,779
I have a lot of friends
who know what I do here...

435
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,282
but they don’t understand
why I take it upon myself.

436
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,993
They think God will provide for them.

437
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,706
I say "Sure, but I’m the middleman."

438
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,541
Besides, it’s better than
spending my time at the café.

439
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,338
Even though he’s young, he prefers fish.

440
00:59:52,963 --> 00:59:55,467
One of them has an eye infection.

441
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:01,847
So I have to give him antibiotic drops.

442
01:00:02,556 --> 01:00:04,934
We've picked up a few things
after so many trips to the vet.

443
01:00:18,405 --> 01:00:19,990
I know all of them.

444
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,119
I know this one’s mother,
her aunts, all five generations.

445
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,289
I remember all her family members.

446
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,378
The one that just gave birth...

447
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:34,297
she’s this one’s little sister.

448
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,135
During winter,
they find shelter under those rocks.

449
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:43,514
They stay alive with the warmth of the sea.

450
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:46,475
Other than that, they don’t have a home.

451
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:54,775
There’s one missing here.
The one that just gave birth.

452
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,195
Let’s see if she’ll come when I call.

453
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,591
I had a nervous breakdown in 2002.

454
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,885
That’s when I got more involved with cats.

455
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,181
Doing this cured me.

456
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:34,691
I was really caught up, I was really lost.

457
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,735
This truly is therapy.

458
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:41,989
Now I’m happy, honestly. Thanks to them.

459
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,575
I wouldn’t be otherwise.
No drug was able to save me.

460
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,916
They’re all waiting for me here.
Their feeding time is near.

461
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:56,046
I believe I got healthy
again by taking care of them.

462
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,048
Before, I couldn’t talk or laugh.

463
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:02,384
But now...

464
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,221
let’s just say,
they make you fall in love again.

465
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:05,967
Just as you notice the cat,
the cat notices you.

466
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,844
It’s very mutual.

467
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,722
I think that mesmerizes
me a little, that it’s so reciprocal.

468
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,016
It’s like a mirror.

469
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,900
Duman – Smokey –
has been with us for two years.

470
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,277
My guess is that
he was kicked out of some place,

471
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,739
because the first night he showed up

472
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,074
I saw him coming down the street

473
01:06:36,074 --> 01:06:37,910
he was complaining very loudly.

474
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,304
He won’t let himself
be a pet like other cats.

475
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:02,184
He never harasses our customers for food.

476
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,938
In time, I came to realize
that he was different to other cats.

477
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,440
He’s a cat with manners.

478
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,777
No matter how hungry he is,
he won’t come in, even if the door is open.

479
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:18,034
He lets us know
he’s hungry by pawing at the window.

480
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,577
He’s a bit of a glutton.

481
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:29,378
He knows that his favorite food is back here

482
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:35,467
so he gets excited
every time he sees us here.

483
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:42,099
He was quite overweight...
nearly 12 pounds when he first showed up.

484
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,353
As our vet also recommended,
we decided to put him on a diet.

485
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:50,358
We fed him
less and less food or only smoked meats.

486
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:57,406
We give him some Manchego
or a softer cheese like Emmental.

487
01:07:57,864 --> 01:07:59,992
A little bit of smoked turkey.

488
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,623
He can also be very
picky about the meat he eats.

489
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:10,210
He used to love roast beef,
but now, he only wants turkey.

490
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,113
I’d say he’s quite happy.

491
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:41,117
He does get around a lot, though.

492
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,662
But he never hangs out with other cats.

493
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,956
He’s always alone. Always alone.

494
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:50,292
There have been times
we’ve gotten him out of dumpsters, too.

495
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:54,630
Beneath that aristocratic
appearance, there is still a street kid.

496
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:40,009
In a way,
street animals are our cultural symbol.

497
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:45,180
Istanbul and cats...
So many cats roaming the streets of a city.

498
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,934
They’ve become
a distinct trait of Istanbul.

499
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,192
The streets seem empty to me without cats…

500
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,987
but it's a strange situation.

501
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,657
It’s a total dilemma if you ask me.

502
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,869
The city no longer accommodates them.

503
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:09,538
But at home,
and I know from my own cats

504
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,873
they forget their cat-ness after a while.

505
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:29,933
Our concerns for street animals
and our concerns for people

506
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,686
are completely related to one another.

507
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:39,776
If you ask me, the troubles that
street cats or other street animals face

508
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,070
are not independent
from the troubles that we all face.

509
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:52,706
It would be easy
to see street cats as a problem

510
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,585
and handle them as a problem.

511
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:01,757
Whereas if we can learn
to live together again,

512
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:06,845
maybe we’ll solve our own
problems as we try to solve theirs.

513
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:12,267
In fact, I’m sure that we would
even regain our fading sense of humor

514
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:17,064
and rekindle
our slowly dying joy for life.

515
01:12:46,069 --> 01:12:49,407
See how he comes to me, isn’t it amazing?

516
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,949
I thank God.

517
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,079
Isn’t that right, Bombis?

518
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,499
My love! Right, Bombis?

519
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:12,305
God says, "I test people."

520
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:20,605
God brings us closer
to him in different ways.

521
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:24,065
For me, it was these animals.

522
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,903
I guess I was worthy of his love.

523
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:39,869
A cat meowing at your feet, looking up at you

524
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,996
is life smiling at you.

525
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:46,207
Those are moments when we’re lucky…

526
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:49,586
they remind us that we’re alive.

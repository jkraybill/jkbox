</font>

8
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:13,798
<font size="68">and for them I created and built three homes.
</font>

9
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,140
<font size="68">One in Rome, one in New York, and
the other one in Freiburg, Germany.
</font>

10
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,101
<font size="68">I discovered too late that from these three places
</font>

11
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:26,643
<font size="68">they rule the world with pain, tears and darkness.

<font size="68">reigns over New York.
</font>

16
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:48,253

</font>

21
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:13,686
<font size="68">But in the beginning, there were three
mothers, as there were three sisters

<font size="68">three Muses, three Graces
three fates, and three furies.

upon becomes deadly and pestilent,
</font>

24
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:23,122

<font size="68">and sometimes the entire neighbourhood
</font>

<font size="68">is hidden in the basements of their homes.
</font>

32
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:46,258
<font size="68">There, you will find an image of the house's dweller.

33
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,981
<font size="68">There is the second key.

<font size="68">The third is under the sole of your shoes.
</font>

35
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:58,606
<font size="68">There is the third key.

<font size="68">Good evening.
</font>

39
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,429
<font size="68">I've come to talk to you about that book.
</font>

40
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,719
<font size="68">Which book?
</font>

41
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,891
<font size="68">The last one you sold me. The Three Mothers.
</font>

42
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,023
<font size="68">Have you read it, by any chance?
</font>

43
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,897
<font size="68">A few passages, yes.
</font>

44
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:51,115
<font size="68">Listen, is it a made-up story,
or is there some truth to it?
</font>

45
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,080
<font size="68">It upset you, right?
</font>

46
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,535
<font size="68">That is nothing more than a book written
</font>

47
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,077
<font size="68">by an ordinary alchemist.
</font>

48

<font size="68">Others believe in them blindly.
</font>

54
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:22,982
<font size="68">Usually, women are the worst readers of these books.
</font>

55
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:26,106
<font size="68">Or the best, rather.
</font>

56
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:29,572
<font size="68">They take everything they read literally.
</font>

57
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:34,532
<font size="68">But no, you see, in one chapter the book
talks about a very particular bad smell.
</font>

58
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:36,954
<font size="68">And in this neighbourhood, I smell
</font>

59
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,659
<font size="68">a strange, sweetish, nauseating smell, you know?
</font>

60
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:43,252
<font size="68">They say it's because of the cookie factory.

61
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:46,996
<font size="68">I've lived here a long time, and I've
always smelled it. Does it bother you?
</font>

62
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:51,382
<font size="68">It's just a matter of getting used to it.
Eventually, you won't notice it.
</font>

63
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:54,394
<font size="68">This isn't the only mystery. There's another one.

66

<font size="68">So what do you believe in?
</font>

144
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,247
<font size="68">In everything I see and touch.
</font>

145
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:24,057
<font size="68">You probably know this music.
</font>

146
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:26,937
<font size="68">It's Verdi's "Va, pensiero".
</font>

147
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:15,985
<font size="68">Mark, is that you?
</font>

148
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:19,739
<font size="68">I have that letter from your sister
that you forgot at the Academy.
</font>

149
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,989
<font size="68">Listen, have you read it?
</font>

150
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,779
<font size="68">You have to read it. It's important.
</font>

151
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:26,826
<font size="68">Come here right away, please. I need to talk to you.
</font>

152
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,082
<font size="68">What's going on?
</font>

153
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:09,831
<font size="68">I don't know. Maybe there's a voltage drop.
</font>

154
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:13,455
<font size="68">- Carlo?
- Yes?
</font>

155
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,665
<font size="68">Listen, where's the electricity meter?
</font>

156
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:21,514
<font size="68">It's in the closet at the end of the hall
but please don't go in there!
</font>

157
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:24,299
<font size="68">Don't worry, I just want to check the switches.
</font>

158
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:27,932
<font size="68">Yes, but keep talking to me.
Always let me know where you are.
</font>

159
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,055
<font size="68">All right.
</font>

160
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:52,576
<font size="68">Carlo?
</font>

161
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:54,998
<font size="68">Carlo, where are you?
</font>

162
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,544
<font size="68">In the closet. I found the switches.
</font>

163
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,300
<font size="68">Wait, I'm coming over there. I'm scared.
</font>

164
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,520
<font size="68">Carlo! Oh, my God, Carlo!
</font>

165
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,814
<font size="68">Carlo, what's going on?
</font>

166
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,020
<font size="68">I think I fixed it.
</font>

167
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:19,895
<font size="68">See?
</font>

168
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,528
<font size="68">Carlo?
</font>

169
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:50,913
<font size="68">Sara?
</font>

170
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:56,657
<font size="68">Sara?
</font>

171
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:01,962
<font size="68">Sara, it's Mark.
</font>

172
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:13,308
<font size="68">"Dear Mark, my brother.
</font>

173
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:19,516
<font size="68">Kazanian. In my house lives... the third
key is under the sole of your shoes".
</font>

174
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:19,752
<font size="68">- Maybe it was a maniac.
- No...
</font>

175
00:39:20,205 --> 00:39:22,575
<font size="68">I think it was the usual crazy slaughterer.
</font>

176
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:27,634
<font size="68">Nobody...
</font>

177
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:30,836
<font size="68">All right...
</font>

178
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:45,645
<font size="68">Do you know what happened?
</font>

179
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:49,111
<font size="68">I-- I don't know anything, she was already dead.
</font>

180
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:51,112
<font size="68">Nothing.
</font>

181
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:53,656
<font size="68"><i>Hello? Hello?</i>
</font>

182
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:57,124
<font size="68"><i>- Rose, can you hear me? It's Mark.
- Oh, Mark, finally,</i>
</font>

183
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:00,792
<font size="68">You sound far away, can you speak louder?
</font>

184
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:02,536
<font size="68"><i>Did you receive my letter?</i>
</font>

185
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:05,582
<font size="68">Yes, yes, I received it,
but I wasn't able to read it.
</font>

186
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:07,626
<font size="68"><i>Why not?</i>
</font>

187
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,763
<font size="68">I just couldn't.
</font>

188
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:12,755
<font size="68">Hello?
</font>

189
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:15,011
<font size="68">I can't hear anything.
</font>

190
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:18,805
<font size="68"><i>So come to New York right away.
Mark, please, do it for me.</i>
</font>

191
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:22,431
<font size="68">I can't hear you.
I don't understand. What's going on?
</font>

192
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,730
<font size="68"><i>Promise me that you'll come here right away.</i>
</font>

193
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,110
<font size="68">Yes, yes, of course. I'll come there right away.
</font>

194
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:31,355
<font size="68">Hello?
</font>

195
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:34,278
<font size="68">Hello? Rose, can you hear me?
</font>

196
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:36,163
<font size="68">Mark?
</font>

197
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:40,042
<font size="68">Mark?
</font>

198
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:24,504
<font size="68">- You shouldn't think about it.
- What is it?
</font>

199
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:27,495
<font size="68">Although, sometimes, it's much better.
</font>

200
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:32,378
<font size="68">They shall come at sunrise. Yes.
</font>

201
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:40,175
<font size="68">This one goes to the usual person.
</font>

202
00:48:41,182 --> 00:48:42,232
<font size="68">Excuse me?
</font>

203
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,016
<font size="68">Yes?
</font>

204
00:48:44,185 --> 00:48:45,475
<font size="68">I'm Mark Elliot, Rose's brother.
</font>

205
00:48:47,313 --> 00:48:48,653
<font size="68">Oh, yes.
</font>

206
00:48:50,942 --> 00:48:54,702
<font size="68">Apartment 45, 4th floor. Here is a copy
of the key. If you'd like to go upstairs...
</font>

207
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:56,777
<font size="68">Thank you.
</font>

208
00:48:57,115 --> 00:49:00,615
<font size="68">- So do you want to go upstairs or not?
- Oh, yes.
</font>

209
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,793
<font size="68">Fourth floor, on the left.
</font>

210
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:09,499
<font size="68">This is Miss Elliot's brother.
</font>

211
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:11,206
<font size="68">He just got here,
</font>

212
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:12,669
<font size="68">all the way from Rome.
</font>

213
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:14,467
<font size="68">Oh, Italy.
</font>

214
00:49:23,808 --> 00:49:25,188
<font size="68">Thank you.
</font>

215
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:37,451
<font size="68">He'd like to talk to you.
</font>

216
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:40,989
<font size="68">That's what he does when
he wants to communicate with someone.
</font>

217
00:49:41,701 --> 00:49:45,541
<font size="68">This is professor George Arnold.
He's been sick for many years.
</font>

218
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:52,246
<font size="68">And what do you do?
</font>

219
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,260
<font size="68">Oh, I-- I study musicology.
</font>

220
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,340
<font size="68">Wonderful. A toxicology professor.
</font>

221
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:04,061
<font size="68">- We know two other--
- Not toxicology, musicology. Nothing
</font>

222
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:06,936
<font size="68">- to do with medicine.
- What is it, then?
</font>

223
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:10,056
<font size="68">The study of music.
</font>

224
00:50:10,438 --> 00:50:13,438
<font size="68">Oh, yes. Your sister has
a very strange job too, right?
</font>

225
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:15,645
<font size="68">Strange? No, she writes poems.
</font>

226
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:19,777
<font size="68">Oh, yes, a very appropriate
pastime for a woman, don't you think?
</font>

227
00:50:20,532 --> 00:50:22,372
<font size="68">Goodbye.
</font>

228
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,891
<font size="68">Rose?
</font>

229
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:56,521
<font size="68">Rose?
</font>

230
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,244
<font size="68">Rose?
</font>

231
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:21,553
<font size="68">Rose?
</font>

232
00:53:29,387 --> 00:53:30,927
<font size="68">- Was that you?
- Yes.
</font>

233
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:34,854
<font size="68">I was calling Rose. I saw
the lights on, so I thought she was back.
</font>

234
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:37,146
<font size="68">We're friends. I live upstairs.
</font>

235
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:40,732
<font size="68">No, Rose is not here. I'm Mark, her brother.
</font>

236
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,936
<font size="68">How did you do that?
The voice sounded strange, it echoed.
</font>

237
00:53:45,069 --> 00:53:47,069
<font size="68">Rose and I discovered it a while ago.
</font>

238
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,280
<font size="68">It's our little secret. Look.
</font>

239
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:54,285
<font size="68">See this hole in the wall?
</font>

240
00:53:54,746 --> 00:53:56,366
<font size="68">It's connected to your apartment.
</font>

241
00:53:56,789 --> 00:53:58,789
<font size="68">It reaches every room through some open pipes.
</font>

242
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,710
<font size="68">When you talk into it
</font>

243
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:02,745
<font size="68">your voice is amplified.
</font>

244
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:06,422
<font size="68">This is an old building
and it's full of strange secrets.
</font>

245
00:54:10,094 --> 00:54:11,974
<font size="68">Listen, do you want to come in?
</font>

246
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:14,353
<font size="68">Okay, but only for a minute.
</font>

247
00:54:20,229 --> 00:54:23,689
<font size="68">No, don't close it. Someone will
come to let me know I get a phone call.
</font>

248
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:26,985
<font size="68">My name is Elise Stallone Van Adler.
</font>

249
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:30,198
<font size="68">I've been living here alone for over five years.
</font>

250
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,990
<font size="68">My husband is always away for work.
</font>

251
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:35,663
<font size="68">I can't go with him, because
</font>

252
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,499
<font size="68">I'm sick.
</font>

253
00:54:53,012 --> 00:54:56,142
<font size="68">It's very strange. Rose knew I'd be arriving.
</font>

254
00:54:57,141 --> 00:54:58,771
<font size="68">I was sure she'd be here waiting for me.
</font>

255
00:54:59,143 --> 00:55:01,233
<font size="68">I don't understand where she could be.
</font>

256
00:55:01,729 --> 00:55:04,519
<font size="68">Listen, what kind of people live here?
</font>

257
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:07,068
<font size="68">There aren't many tenants.
</font>

258
00:55:07,527 --> 00:55:09,447
<font size="68">Part of the building is empty.
</font>

259
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:13,409
<font size="68">No, I mean
</font>

260
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:16,445
<font size="68">anybody special. I don't know...
</font>

261
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:19,254
<font size="68">I can't explain it, but
in one of her letters Rose mentioned--
</font>

262
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:23,747
<font size="68">All I know is that this building used
to belong to an eccentric, rich old man.
</font>

263
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:26,462
<font size="68">When he died, it was vacant for years
</font>

264
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:28,629
<font size="68">until a holding company took it over.
</font>

265
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:31,259
<font size="68">Who is Kazanian?
</font>

266
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:34,514
<font size="68">He's an antique book seller who has a store nearby.
</font>

267
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:37,558
<font size="68">Rose bought some very rare books from him.
</font>

268
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:39,429
<font size="68">And also--
</font>

269
00:55:46,149 --> 00:55:47,279
<font size="68">Please excuse me.
</font>

270
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,530
<font size="68">You have a phone call, Madame Countess.
</font>

271
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,574
<font size="68">All right, I'll be right there.
</font>

272
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:54,279
<font size="68">- Bye, see you tomorrow, Mark.
- Bye.
</font>

273
00:56:04,667 --> 00:56:05,957
<font size="68">Did you hurt yourself, Madame Countess?
</font>

274
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:08,915
<font size="68">No, no, it's paint, not blood.
</font>

275
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:55,947
<font size="68">Who's there?
</font>

276
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,963
<font size="68">Who's there?
</font>

277
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:25,683
<font size="68">You filthy animal.
</font>

278
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,980
<font size="68">Damn cats.
</font>

279
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:45,619
<font size="68">How much was the dose this time?
</font>

280
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,421
<font size="68">The first was 200 milligrams.
</font>

281
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:52,629
<font size="68">The second, 400.
</font>

282
00:58:54,086 --> 00:58:56,416
<font size="68">This is the strongest dose.
</font>

283
00:58:57,715 --> 00:58:59,925
<font size="68">Do you want me to run you a bath?
</font>

284
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:02,932
<font size="68">Thank you.
</font>

285
00:59:55,898 --> 00:59:57,268
<font size="68">Blood.
</font>

286
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:10,871
<font size="68">Your bath is ready, ma'am.
</font>

287
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,670
<font size="68">Good night. See you tomorrow morning.
</font>

288
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:15,673
<font size="68">Good night.
</font>

289
01:00:15,876 --> 01:00:17,746
<font size="68">I hope you sleep well.
</font>

290
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,990
<font size="68">There is some blood in the hallway.
</font>

291
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,367
<font size="68">Did you notice that the door handle is broken?
</font>

292
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:52,788
<font size="68">- Yes, I saw that.
- I want to tell you something.
</font>

293
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:56,535
<font size="68">I thought Rose was just raving.
</font>

294
01:00:57,042 --> 01:01:00,252
<font size="68">Her nervousness, her fear of death,
</font>

295
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:03,008
<font size="68">the myth of the Three Mothers.
</font>

296
01:01:03,424 --> 01:01:05,684
<font size="68">- And what's that?
- It's her obsession.
</font>

297
01:01:06,218 --> 01:01:07,508
<font size="68">They are three Latin names.
</font>

298
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,220
<font size="68">Mater Suspiriorum,
</font>

299
01:01:10,848 --> 01:01:12,218
<font size="68">the mother of sighs.
</font>

300
01:01:12,558 --> 01:01:15,728
<font size="68">Mater Lachrymarum, the mother of tears.
</font>

301
01:01:16,312 --> 01:01:19,272
<font size="68">And Mater Tenebrarum, the mother of darkness.
</font>

302
01:01:19,857 --> 01:01:22,227
<font size="68">Rose read about this myth in an old book.
</font>

303
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:24,735
<font size="68">And she talks about it like it's a true story.
</font>

304
01:01:25,863 --> 01:01:28,073
<font size="68">She thinks someone lives in this building.
</font>

305
01:01:28,532 --> 01:01:30,032
<font size="68">But I don't know. I can't explain it to you.
</font>

306
01:01:30,409 --> 01:01:33,369
<font size="68">She should tell you. It all sounds absurd to me
</font>

307
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:36,253
<font size="68">so impossible. She's convinced that somehow
</font>

308
01:01:36,707 --> 01:01:38,957
<font size="68">the building is connected to those three mothers.
</font>

309
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,090
<font size="68">She talked about an architect
Marelli or Varelli, I don't remember.
</font>

310
01:01:42,588 --> 01:01:43,758
<font size="68">An Italian name.
</font>

311
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:46,721
<font size="68">That's how she expresses herself. It's confusing--
</font>

312
01:01:47,468 --> 01:01:51,388
<font size="68">Excited. And the feeling of always being watched.
</font>

313
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:54,597
<font size="68">She's felt its presence.
</font>

314
01:01:57,102 --> 01:02:00,272
<font size="68">I believe her doctor gave...
</font>

315
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:09,701
<font size="68">Did you hear that laugh?
</font>

316
01:02:10,324 --> 01:02:11,914
<font size="68">- Which laugh?
- I thought I heard
</font>

317
01:02:13,285 --> 01:02:14,615
<font size="68">someone laughing.
</font>

318
01:02:14,995 --> 01:02:16,905
<font size="68">You were right, Elise.
</font>

319
01:02:18,123 --> 01:02:20,463
<font size="68">This is really blood. Come take a look.
</font>

320
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:36,144
<font size="68">- Where does that door lead to?
- The service stairs. No one uses them.
</font>

321
01:02:36,934 --> 01:02:39,104
<font size="68">Maybe Rose went out this way.
</font>

322
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,310
<font size="68">- I'll go take a look. You want to go?
- No, I'll wait for you here.
</font>

323
01:02:42,898 --> 01:02:44,648
<font size="68">I'm scared.
</font>

324
01:02:45,484 --> 01:02:46,944
<font size="68">All right.
</font>

325
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:41,934
<font size="68">Mark.
</font>

326
01:04:42,851 --> 01:04:44,101
<font size="68">Mark.
</font>

327
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:48,901
<font size="68">Mark.
</font>

328
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:50,783
<font size="68">Where are you?
</font>

329
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:15,089
<font size="68">Mark?
</font>

330
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:17,506
<font size="68">Answer me.
</font>

331
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:25,745
<font size="68">Open the door, please!
</font>

332
01:08:28,827 --> 01:08:30,247
<font size="68">My heart.
</font>

333
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:36,079
<font size="68">Please help me. Pain... My heart...
</font>

334
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:41,761
<font size="68">He says it's his heart.
</font>

335
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:45,337
<font size="68">A cardiotonic. He'll feel better right away.
</font>

336
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:52,349
<font size="68">My-- My God.
</font>

337
01:08:52,768 --> 01:08:54,308
<font size="68">I'm in so much pain.
</font>

338
01:08:54,686 --> 01:08:57,436
<font size="68">Come on, drink this. You'll see, it will help.
</font>

339
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:06,778
<font size="68">Where did Rose go?
</font>

340
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:09,157
<font size="68">Where did she go?
</font>

341
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:11,496
<font size="68">Why isn't she coming back? Why?
</font>

342
01:09:12,996 --> 01:09:15,996
<font size="68">I think we better take him to his apartment.
</font>

343
01:09:17,876 --> 01:09:18,876
<font size="68">Where did she go?
</font>

344
01:10:53,263 --> 01:10:54,263
<font size="68">Elise?
</font>

345
01:10:55,474 --> 01:10:57,434
<font size="68">Elise, it's Mark. Can you hear me?
</font>

346
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,976
<font size="68">Elise, it's Mark.
</font>

347
01:11:01,646 --> 01:11:02,686
<font size="68">Elise.
</font>

348
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:08,279
<font size="68">Elise, it's Mark.
</font>

349
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:17,659
<font size="68">It's really disgusting.
</font>

350
01:11:17,954 --> 01:11:19,544
<font size="68">There must be a dozen cats here.
</font>

351
01:11:19,915 --> 01:11:21,875
<font size="68">They keep getting in my way.
</font>

352
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:25,924
<font size="68">The other night one of those damn cats
scratched me and broke a little statue.
</font>

353
01:11:26,588 --> 01:11:29,928
<font size="68">This is the last time I tell you, because next time
</font>

354
01:11:30,509 --> 01:11:31,889
<font size="68">I'll go to the police
</font>

355
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,100
<font size="68">or to the Health Department, if I have to.
</font>

356
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:35,601
<font size="68">I warned you.
</font>

357
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:37,682
<font size="68">You better make those
</font>

358
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,140
<font size="68">damn cats disappear.
</font>

359
01:11:39,476 --> 01:11:42,266
<font size="68">Do whatever you want, Mr. Kazanian.
</font>

360
01:11:43,688 --> 01:11:44,818
<font size="68">Good morning.
</font>

361
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:47,231
<font size="68">Do you feel better, Mr. Elliot?
</font>

362
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:49,487
<font size="68">Yes, but I don't remember
what happened to me last night.
</font>

363
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:51,491
<font size="68">You weren't feeling well. You know, your heart.
</font>

364
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:52,912
<font size="68">I've never had heart problems.
</font>

365
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,580
<font size="68">- We gave you some medicine.
- Who was that man?
</font>

366
01:11:56,076 --> 01:11:57,486
<font size="68">That guy? His name is Kazanian.
</font>

367
01:11:57,828 --> 01:12:00,578
<font size="68">- He's an antique dealer.
- Thanks, and thanks for last night.
</font>

368
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:02,499
<font size="68">You're welcome.
</font>

369
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:06,041
<font size="68">- Mr. Kazanian.
- Yes?
</font>

370
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:08,259
<font size="68">My name is Mark Elliot. I'm Rose's brother.
</font>

371
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,172
<font size="68">- I know you know her.
- Oh, I remember her.
</font>

372
01:12:10,507 --> 01:12:12,427
<font size="68">- Yes, she bought several books.
- Do you know her well?
</font>

373
01:12:12,884 --> 01:12:15,304
<font size="68">- No, why?
- No one has seen her in two days.
</font>

374
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:17,886
<font size="68">- I thought that--
- I just sold her some books.
</font>

375
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:19,716
<font size="68">What kind of books?
</font>

376
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,640
<font size="68">Antique books, old editions.
</font>

377
01:12:23,103 --> 01:12:26,863
<font size="68">If you can't find her, why don't
you try the usual routine?
</font>

378
01:12:27,524 --> 01:12:30,364
<font size="68">- And what's that?
- Call the hospitals
</font>

379
01:12:30,902 --> 01:12:33,492
<font size="68">- or the police.
- I did, but they don't know anything.
</font>

380
01:12:33,947 --> 01:12:35,657
<font size="68">Listen, do you understand this phrase?
</font>

381
01:12:36,074 --> 01:12:37,914
<font size="68">"The key is under the sole of your shoes".
</font>

382
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,118
<font size="68">What's that, a riddle?
</font>

383
01:12:40,537 --> 01:12:43,287
<font size="68">I'm not too good with riddles.
</font>

384
01:12:47,586 --> 01:12:49,376
<font size="68">How long have you been here?
</font>

385
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:52,376
<font size="68">I just got here yesterday.
</font>

386
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:57,180
<font size="68">You know what? There is going
to be a lunar eclipse tonight.
</font>

387
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:00,219
<font size="68">Oh, I didn't know.
</font>

388
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:04,984
<font size="68">It's been 46 years since the last
total eclipse we saw from here.
</font>

389
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:08,979
<font size="68">They just said so on television.
</font>

390
01:13:09,608 --> 01:13:11,228
<font size="68">I urge you to watch it.
</font>

391
01:13:11,651 --> 01:13:15,031
<font size="68">- It will be very interesting.
- All right, I'll watch it.
</font>

392
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:17,699
<font size="68">You'll thank me for it.
</font>

393
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:31,421
<font size="68">Goodbye, Mr. Elliot.
</font>

394
01:13:32,422 --> 01:13:34,262
<font size="68">Goodbye.
</font>

395
01:14:02,827 --> 01:14:04,697
<font size="68">Where are you?
</font>

396
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,330
<font size="68">There you are.
</font>

397
01:14:11,878 --> 01:14:13,628
<font size="68">There you are.
</font>

398
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:20,349
<font size="68">Come on, boy, come out of there.
</font>

399
01:14:23,723 --> 01:14:27,353
<font size="68">Come on, come out of there. Come on.
</font>

400
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,730
<font size="68">Come here, boy.
</font>

401
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:35,526
<font size="68">Good boy.
</font>

402
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:44,038
<font size="68">You wanted to hide, huh?
</font>

403
01:18:26,883 --> 01:18:29,303
<font size="68">My crutch.
</font>

404
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:33,431
<font size="68">Help me!
</font>

405
01:18:45,902 --> 01:18:48,572
<font size="68">My legs. Help me.
</font>

406
01:19:03,836 --> 01:19:05,376
<font size="68">Help me!
</font>

407
01:19:12,303 --> 01:19:15,103
<font size="68">Please! Please!
</font>

408
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:24,939
<font size="68">Oh, God! Rats, no.
</font>

409
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:34,617
<font size="68">I can't take it anymore!
</font>

410
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:38,753
<font size="68">Rats! Oh, my God, rats!
</font>

411
01:19:52,427 --> 01:19:53,757
<font size="68">Help!
</font>

412
01:20:08,735 --> 01:20:09,985
<font size="68">Help! Oh, my God!
</font>

413
01:20:31,007 --> 01:20:34,007
<font size="68">Save me, Christ! Someone get me out of here!
</font>

414
01:20:34,552 --> 01:20:38,062
<font size="68">Get out of here! Go away!
</font>

415
01:20:38,765 --> 01:20:40,675
<font size="68">Please, help!
</font>

416
01:20:44,062 --> 01:20:46,902
<font size="68">Hurry! Hurry, run! They're eating me alive!
</font>

417
01:20:50,693 --> 01:20:54,743
<font size="68">I can't take it anymore! Hurry!
</font>

418
01:20:55,615 --> 01:20:59,405
<font size="68">Rats! Run! Help!
</font>

419
01:21:48,793 --> 01:21:50,133
<font size="68">Come take a look.
</font>

420
01:21:50,753 --> 01:21:53,173
<font size="68">Oh, my God. That's a lot of stuff.
</font>

421
01:21:53,673 --> 01:21:57,763
<font size="68">That horrible countess thought
she had hidden them well.
</font>

422
01:21:58,553 --> 01:22:01,813
<font size="68">But you know what? It took
me less than 15 minutes to find them.
</font>

423
01:22:02,432 --> 01:22:04,482
<font size="68">- You've been drinking today.
- No, that's not true.
</font>

424
01:22:04,976 --> 01:22:08,306
<font size="68">- You have been drinking, I can smell it.
- I told you I haven't.
</font>

425
01:22:15,319 --> 01:22:16,699
<font size="68">Well.
</font>

426
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,779
<font size="68">Now, go upstairs and call her husband right away.
</font>

427
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:23,084
<font size="68">Do you know where to find him?
</font>

428
01:22:23,494 --> 01:22:26,044
<font size="68">Tell him the countess left suddenly
</font>

429
01:22:26,539 --> 01:22:28,669
<font size="68">taking all her valuables with her.
</font>

430
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,670
<font size="68">- And what if she comes back?
- She won't.
</font>

431
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:35,917
<font size="68">- Don't worry, she's never coming back.
- How can you be so sure?
</font>

432
01:22:36,507 --> 01:22:37,677
<font size="68">What if she shows up?
</font>

433
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,140
<font size="68">I told you, the countess is never coming back here.
</font>

434
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,769
<font size="68">Now, go call her husband.
</font>

435
01:22:46,267 --> 01:22:48,687
<font size="68">Soon, it will be our turn to enjoy life
</font>

436
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:51,395
<font size="68">as much as the countess enjoyed it
</font>

437
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:54,109
<font size="68">along with all those other rich bastards.
</font>

438
01:23:31,562 --> 01:23:32,902
<font size="68">Who is it?
</font>

439
01:23:58,756 --> 01:24:00,216
<font size="68">Who's there?
</font>

440
01:24:20,778 --> 01:24:22,238
<font size="68">John?
</font>

441
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:29,786
<font size="68">John?
</font>

442
01:24:32,915 --> 01:24:34,325
<font size="68">John?
</font>

443
01:27:34,263 --> 01:27:36,353
<font size="68">How did that phrase go?
</font>

444
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:42,691
<font size="68">"Under the sole of your shoes".
</font>

445
01:28:18,849 --> 01:28:22,649
<font size="68">"The key is under the sole of your shoes".
</font>

446
01:36:47,858 --> 01:36:49,478
<font size="68">Did you find the way?
</font>

447
01:36:54,114 --> 01:36:57,584
<font size="68">- I suppose you know who I am.
- No, I don't know.
</font>

448
01:36:58,243 --> 01:37:01,503
<font size="68">Many years ago, when I lived
in London, I was known as Varelli.
</font>

449
01:37:02,205 --> 01:37:06,075
<font size="68">Now, I use another name in order to be forgotten.
</font>

450
01:37:06,793 --> 01:37:08,843
<font size="68">Are you surprised to hear my voice?
</font>

451
01:37:09,296 --> 01:37:11,506
<font size="68">I can only talk with this.
</font>

452
01:37:12,299 --> 01:37:14,639
<font size="68">I built the houses of the Three Mothers.
</font>

453
01:37:15,177 --> 01:37:17,097
<font size="68">Houses that are eyes with which they see.
</font>

454
01:37:17,596 --> 01:37:20,426
<font size="68">And then I buried myself in here.
</font>

455
01:37:21,016 --> 01:37:24,386
<font size="68">This building has become my body,
its bricks are my cells.
</font>

456
01:37:25,062 --> 01:37:27,232
<font size="68">Its passageways are my veins.
</font>

457
01:37:27,814 --> 01:37:30,074
<font size="68">Its horror is my life now.
</font>

458
01:37:31,234 --> 01:37:33,744
<font size="68">My sister. Where is my sister?
</font>

459
01:37:34,321 --> 01:37:37,411
<font size="68">Come closer. She mustn't hear us.
</font>

460
01:37:37,991 --> 01:37:40,241
<font size="68">She's the cruelest of all three.
</font>

461
01:37:40,744 --> 01:37:42,914
<font size="68">The mother of darkness.
</font>

462
01:37:44,373 --> 01:37:46,253
<font size="68">Come here.
</font>

463
01:37:48,502 --> 01:37:52,012
<font size="68">You're not afraid of
an old man who can't move, are you?
</font>

464
01:37:52,673 --> 01:37:56,393
<font size="68">I'll whisper it in your ear. Come a little closer.
</font>

465
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:12,627
<font size="68">I-- I am dying.
</font>

466
01:39:13,128 --> 01:39:15,088
<font size="68">But nothing will ever be able to change.
</font>

467
01:39:15,505 --> 01:39:19,795
<font size="68">They won't allow it.
They don't want anything to change.
</font>

468
01:39:21,094 --> 01:39:24,684
<font size="68">I am not the master. I am only
</font>

469
01:39:25,348 --> 01:39:28,688
<font size="68">- a servant.
- Who lives in these damned houses?
</font>

470
01:39:29,269 --> 01:39:32,109
<font size="68">Someone who waits.
</font>

471
01:39:32,731 --> 01:39:36,071
<font size="68">- Who is it?
- She's watching you right now.
</font>

472
01:39:40,071 --> 01:39:41,741
<font size="68">But remember one thing:
</font>

473
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:45,330
<font size="68">You are dust compared to her.
</font>

474
01:40:50,141 --> 01:40:51,891
<font size="68">Burning.
</font>

475
01:40:53,937 --> 01:40:57,897
<font size="68">Everything is burning.
It has already happened once before.
</font>

476
01:40:59,401 --> 01:41:01,191
<font size="68">We have to get out of this place.
</font>

477
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:27,300
<font size="68">You will not leave.
</font>

478
01:41:28,388 --> 01:41:30,098
<font size="68">The end of your journey is near.
</font>

479
01:41:30,557 --> 01:41:32,347
<font size="68">Everything around you will become dark.
</font>

480
01:41:32,809 --> 01:41:35,689
<font size="68">Someone will guide you
by the hand, and you'll be glad.
</font>

481
01:41:36,271 --> 01:41:41,231
<font size="68">You must not be afraid. You will also
know moments of incredible light.
</font>

482
01:41:51,286 --> 01:41:54,916
<font size="68">You think this is magic? No.
</font>

483
01:41:55,832 --> 01:41:58,382
<font size="68">I am not a magician. Let's hurry now
</font>

484
01:41:58,919 --> 01:42:02,509
<font size="68">because you still have to go through
several apparitions and tremble.
</font>

485
01:42:03,256 --> 01:42:05,716
<font size="68">You were looking for me, right?
Just like your sister.
</font>

486
01:42:06,259 --> 01:42:09,179
<font size="68">This is what you wanted, right?
I'm coming to get you now.
</font>

487
01:42:09,846 --> 01:42:12,886
<font size="68">- Who are you?
- The Three Mothers.
</font>

488
01:42:13,475 --> 01:42:15,435
<font size="68">What, you don't understand?
</font>

489
01:42:15,894 --> 01:42:19,024
<font size="68">Mater Tenebrarum, Mater Lachrymarum,
</font>

490
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:22,360
<font size="68">Mater Suspiriorum
</font>

491
01:42:22,901 --> 01:42:25,951
<font size="68">but men call us by one name,
</font>

492
01:42:26,529 --> 01:42:28,869
<font size="68">a name which frightens everyone.
</font>

493
01:42:29,366 --> 01:42:32,286
<font size="68">They call us Death.
</font>

494
01:42:32,786 --> 01:42:34,116
<font size="68">Death!
</font>

495
01:43:52,032 --> 01:43:53,912
<font size="68">Stand back, stand back.
</font>

496
01:43:54,284 --> 01:43:55,414
<font size="68">Stand back.
</font>

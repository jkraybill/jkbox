1
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,851
Dubey!

2
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,645
Dubey!
<i>- Not here.</i>

3
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,273
Not here yet?
He's an impossible fellow!

4
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,859
Nearly 1 1:00. How to fix this?

5
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,044
He wants money
but doesn't want to work.

6
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,465
Dubeyji? Lalit Verma, who else?

7
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,676
Very kind of you to answer.

8
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:40,346
What's going on? No sign of anyone.

9
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:47,520
Fry the <i>pakoras.</i>
Tea for the master. Hurry!

10
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,864
God forbid it!
The wedding is so soon.

11
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,827
Hundreds of things to get tense about.

12
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:05,872
The marigold gate is falling apart.

13
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,291
The flowers are everywhere.
What's going on?

14
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:12,962
No need to get so upset, sir.

15
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:17,383
Flowers? What's a few flowers?

16
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,179
For you, I'll bring Kashmir's Mughal garden.

17
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,222
Just say the word.

18
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,017
I'm stranded in a traffic jam.

19
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,519
Enough! Get here on the double.

20
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,314
Ten minutes, exactly and approximately.

21
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,900
I can't phone and drive.

22
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,571
What's the idiot up to?

23
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,630
Where were you?

24
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,177
You're incredible.

25
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,490
The guests are on their way.

26
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,538
Did you? Out with the truth!

27
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,909
<i>These are our laws.</i>

28
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,871
Change the constitution,
then censorship will follow.

29
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,664
What do you think?

30
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:17,855
Let's hear some dialogue
from the new script.

31
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,065
Go ahead, please.

32
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:31,536
Give it to me.

33
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,539
Come on.

34
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,749
More, big boy. More.

35
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,128
I like it like that.

36
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,464
Big boy, I like it.

37
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,049
Give me more.

38
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,927
Come inside me.

39
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,972
Give it to me.

40
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,143
Come!

41
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,910
If he wants the works,

42
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,831
then he must get the cash out.

43
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,917
The one-rupee era is over.

44
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,586
Tea anyone?

45
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,338
Four teas.

46
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,382
- King Dubey!
- At your service.

47
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,050
Gracing us with your presence?

48
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,094
Your daughter is my daughter.
Why worry?

49
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:39,098
The wedding is in four days.

50
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,474
Today, the engagement.

51
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,226
The groom is on his way.

52
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,645
Want me to lose face?
- Important call.

53
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:45,938
Call my pager, damn it!

54
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,858
More important things to do?

55
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,277
Now you're an event manager.

56
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,362
Fix this now!
- Yadav!

57
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,114
Tameez-ud-Din!

58
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,490
Lottery!

59
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,618
Get down. Fix it!

60
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,998
Insolent bums!
Want tea, do you? To work!

61
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,459
Right away!

62
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,212
Hi, Uncle!

63
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,050
King Dubey, move your van.

64
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,801
Move the van!

65
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,386
Where have you been?

66
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:29,315
How lovely!

67
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,652
Take it easy.

68
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,365
No, Ma.

69
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:23,869
I'll stop at the temple.
It may get late.

70
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:27,498
No, I won't eat at home.
I'll come late.

71
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,293
You can pack the food in the tiffin.

72
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,759
Forgive me.

73
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:53,357
Ma, leave the worrying
about the stock market to me.

74
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,776
I can deal with it.

75
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:59,822
Twelve rupees a minute
calling me on the mobile.

76
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,739
Hang up.

77
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:47,578
I saw cousin Aditi naked,
and I almost saw you naked too.

78
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,800
Enough.
Get dressed for the engagement.

79
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,988
What is it, my child?

80
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,910
In God's name,

81
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:30,663
what on earth is written here?

82
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,713
There is no such word, my child.

83
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,883
It's a spelling mistake.

84
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:48,138
There should be an L here.
It's "luxurious."

85
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,972
Brought the whiskey?

86
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,279
Anyone about?

87
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,198
Let's take the whiskey in.

88
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,825
Australian idiot-you!

89
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,750
We're hardly late.
You get tense for nothing.

90
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,599
Talk fast.
Can't catch the network.

91
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,435
Let me come down.

92
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,479
One minute!

93
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,358
Speak. No, no, no.

94
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,069
Yes, I'll be there.

95
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,907
That's correct. Take the advance.

96
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,495
Life's such a comedy.

97
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:38,207
No signal up there.
But there's one down here.

98
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:44,171
The virtuous virgin look
really suits me.

99
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,978
Breasts like baby mangoes.

100
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,857
The groom!

101
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,696
The groom's here!

102
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,289
Congratulations, Mr. Rai!

103
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,473
Pay your respects to Grandmother.

104
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,858
Look what I have for you.

105
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,612
Know why God arranged
your marriage in a hurry?

106
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,907
I told him I had to see
a great-grandson before dying.

107
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,116
He heard me!

108
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,290
How beautiful!

109
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,792
So fair and lovely.

110
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,503
Say hello to Hemant.

111
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,925
Enough!

112
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,557
I met C.L. only once,
and we got married right away!

113
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,441
Don't you feel like getting married?

114
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,386
Sweeten your mouths, my dears.

115
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,190
Just in time!

116
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,318
My dear brother-in-law!

117
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,111
Look at him.

118
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,385
What a complete idiot!

119
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,980
Calls my son an idiot,
then calls him a duffer.

120
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,649
Who does he think he is?

121
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,817
I'm not coming back to India.

122
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:40,008
My naughty niece,
couldn't you wait?

123
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,973
The motherfucker doesn't have
a dime to his name,

124
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,353
and he wants the White House theme
for his daughter's wedding!

125
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,065
How the fuck will that happen?

126
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,401
The swine hasn't any shit in him,

127
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,486
and he invites other pigs for dinner!

128
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,615
What?

129
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,326
- We need more ice.
- What?

130
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,790
I've told them once.

131
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:57,085
I've told them a thousand times
they'll need ice.

132
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,879
They never listen.

133
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,926
Now what?

134
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,472
Do you need some water?

135
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,308
Water?

136
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,484
Okay.

137
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,162
Fridge water or tap water?

138
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,586
Fridge water.

139
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:57,729
<i>Our eyes made the right signal</i>

140
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,943
<i>And I found a partner for life</i>

141
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,241
Shut up, you assholes!

142
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,206
I quit.

143
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,376
America makes everyone quit smoking.

144
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,752
The Rais are so cultured.

145
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,633
Speak a little English and you become
a very cultured family.

146
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:28,802
Rai!

147
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,578
Make her understand.

148
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,292
Lots of money in writing these days.

149
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,128
That girl who won the Booker Prize

150
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,464
became an overnight millionaire!

151
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,189
Two weddings in one!

152
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,322
I have anotherjoke.
Nonvegetarian!

153
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,831
Let me start rehearsing, then.

154
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,221
I won't listen to you
or to Ria's mother.

155
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:27,772
I can still work.

156
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,214
This is India's big problem.

157
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:40,387
Alice, has the fuse blown?

158
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,722
Alice! Get the phone.

159
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,948
When are you arriving?

160
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,618
Yes, yes. She's here,
swinging on my shoulders.

161
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:05,954
The line's cut.

162
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,191
Sisterfucker, what a pain!

163
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,539
All the fuses have blown.

164
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:50,957
Pardon?

165
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,253
Which is the house fuse?

166
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,880
This one?

167
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,925
I'll fix it right away.

168
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,679
The light, a little closer, please.

169
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,268
A little to this side, please.

170
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,362
A little lower.

171
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,909
Your shadow is in the way.

172
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,621
A little closer.

173
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:02,362
Trying to say something?
It's hot today.

174
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,031
Switch it on. The power is back.

175
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,801
What a silly asshole I am.

176
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,361
Eat, Son, eat!

177
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,800
What is it?

178
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,218
Some gratitude.

179
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,221
We are so grateful, dear Pimmi.

180
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:48,272
This wedding is driving me crazy!

181
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,083
Today will be a long day.

182
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,128
It's hot, too, after all that rain.

183
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,798
May I have...

184
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:16,092
a glass ofwater?

185
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,177
I'm very thirsty.

186
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,522
What is your good name?

187
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,986
It's an English name.

188
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,990
Where are you from?
- Bihar.

189
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,162
What's your name?

190
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,004
Parbatlal Kanhaiyalal Dubey.

191
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,008
But I've changed it to P.K. Dubey.

192
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:01,637
But it makes people laugh.
In the city, they call me Dubeyji.

193
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,723
Parbatlal is a nice name.

194
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:18,779
They're newly printed.

195
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:23,117
I'm into event management.

196
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:27,246
It has the address to send mail
through the computer.

197
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,251
You know about it? Yes.

198
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,923
Keep it. Take some more.

199
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,342
This is fine.

200
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:52,897
Tell me you love me.

201
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:57,568
Have you seen the movie
<i>Tell Me You Love Me</i>?

202
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,195
Yes.

203
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,247
What happened?

204
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,249
Nothing happened.

205
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,920
I must be going.

206
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,902
Tell me something.

207
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:44,448
How many weddings
have I organized so far?

208
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:49,203
At least 150 or 175.

209
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:54,917
How come I'm not married yet?

210
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:01,298
My poor mother has grown old saying,

211
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,969
"Son, get me a daughter-in-law."

212
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,974
Now I've done my thinking.

213
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:14,145
I'll put an end
to my lonesome, vagabond life.

214
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:20,860
I'll find myself a decent, simple girl

215
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,447
and begin life as a family man.

216
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:30,870
The hope now is that
the next tent Dubey puts up

217
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:34,790
has Dubey entering as the groom.

218
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,501
Bravo!

219
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,337
I swear, pure genius!

220
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,132
Motherfucker.

221
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:47,094
Do I pay you to sit on your ass?
Get to work!

222
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:54,894
Coming, sir.

223
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,355
Not a minute of peace.

224
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,027
This is the limit. A white tent?

225
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,491
A white tent?

226
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,326
- Yes, sir.
- What's this "yes, sir"?

227
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,661
What's with the white tent?

228
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:17,166
This is the fashion these days.
Millennium style. Y2K dot.

229
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,709
Smart-ass!

230
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:22,254
A white tent!
Is this a wedding or a funeral?

231
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:25,883
I only have one daughter.
I don't want a white tent.

232
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,676
Put up a colorful tent.

233
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,386
Red, yellow, green, blue.

234
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,679
Okay. Yadav!

235
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:33,265
Get this down. It's not wanted.

236
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,892
He wants the old look.

237
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:36,602
Get it down.

238
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,021
What about the waterproofing?

239
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,856
It was never discussed.

240
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:42,691
What do you mean, Dubey?

241
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,695
The peacocks have stopped dancing.
It won't rain.

242
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,615
Peacocks? You've been smoking pot?

243
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:52,118
Okay, sir. Advance.

244
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,917
In foreign countries, deal is deal.

245
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,254
Look, sir.

246
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,590
See, everything in foreign style.
In writing.

247
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,260
The number of plates and spoons.

248
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,928
But no waterproofing.

249
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,347
You want more? Pay more.

250
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,600
How much?

251
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:27,695
$5,000.

252
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,574
I'm not a nonresident Indian.

253
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:35,494
Your garden is huge.
Well, your daughter is my daughter.

254
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:36,996
Advance, sir.

255
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:40,207
Today we work. Tomorrow, holiday.
Strike, day after.

256
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:43,836
Then our wedding.
- This is all I have now.

257
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,839
I'll give you the rest later.

258
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,842
This won't pay for a thing.

259
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:14,450
You'll fall sick.
A Popsicle, now?

260
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:18,245
This one's for Hemant's sister.

261
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:21,123
You bought one
for his cousin in Bangalore?

262
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,958
So many cousins!

263
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:25,294
Look at this silk sari.

264
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:29,173
So smooth,
even a fly could slide on it.

265
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:33,761
Once your eyes behold its beauty,
the fly has gone.

266
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:36,513
It's too gaudy.

267
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:41,393
- Who's the bride?
- She's having a Popsicle outside.

268
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,746
Come!

269
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,143
<i>Put them properly.</i>

270
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,520
Over there.

271
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,189
All right.

272
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:06,288
Not a single flower in place yet.

273
00:46:58,275 --> 00:46:59,943
I knew it. She's a thief!

274
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:18,086
Mother fucker.

275
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:29,431
Mother fuckers!

276
00:47:29,598 --> 00:47:32,184
She's not stealing. Fucking ass holes!

277
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,334
You don't come to golf these days.

278
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:00,254
I'm busy with my daughter's wedding.

279
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:20,315
How much do you need, pal?

280
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:21,400
$1 2,000.

281
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:34,371
A daughter's wedding,
that's what happens.

282
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,499
Or I'd be wiped out.

283
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,593
<i>O women of the house</i>

284
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:49,678
<i>Decorate me with henna</i>

285
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:58,937
<i>Make these fair hands</i>
<i>beautiful with henna</i>

286
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:08,280
<i>Madhorama asks</i>
<i>Which one shall we marry</i>

287
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,744
<i>Madhorama says</i>
<i>The Fat One</i>

288
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,416
<i>The Fat One needs</i>
<i>too large a bed to sleep on</i>

289
00:49:25,756 --> 00:49:28,008
<i>- Let's drop her by the wayside</i>
<i>- Right on</i>

290
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,512
<i>- We want another</i>
<i>- Right on</i>

291
00:49:32,596 --> 00:49:34,765
<i>We are fancy gentlemen</i>

292
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,017
<i>Brimming with lust and desire</i>

293
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:39,269
<i>Life intoxicates us</i>

294
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:43,815
<i>Do I lie</i>
<i>- No way</i>

295
00:49:52,366 --> 00:49:56,286
<i>Madhorama asks</i>
<i>Which one shall we marry</i>

296
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:01,750
<i>Madhorama says</i>
<i>The Fair One</i>

297
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:07,631
<i>The Fair One has the color of butter</i>

298
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:13,303
<i>She sleeps alone on the roof</i>
<i>as her lover pines for her below</i>

299
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,847
<i>This is the one we'll have</i>

300
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,808
<i>This is the one we like</i>

301
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,518
<i>We will marry her</i>

302
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:24,481
Shashi, remember
when we were newly weds?

303
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:26,316
Lalit and my brother would sleep.

304
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,903
You'd come to my room
and tell me dirty jokes.

305
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:33,615
Your Lalit may have gone to sleep,

306
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:38,495
but my C.L. would never sleep,
nor would he let me sleep!

307
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:00,392
Go! No men allowed!

308
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,650
Stick with me.
You'll have fun with me!

309
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:12,446
Cash in on the pleasures of life with me.

310
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:15,490
I'm giving birth!

311
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,998
Lemon juice. The henna's drying.

312
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:37,257
<i>As I leave</i>
<i>for my father-in-law's house</i>

313
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:43,179
<i>I will take your dreams with me</i>

314
00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:00,447
<i>The gift of bracelets</i>

315
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:05,535
<i>Binds me in marriage</i>

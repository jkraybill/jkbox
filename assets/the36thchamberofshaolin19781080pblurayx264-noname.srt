1
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,455
Good luck, general yin

2
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:10,996
A man must do or die

3
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:13,921
Mr. ho, before I left

4
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,378
lord zheng is concerned about you

5
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,961
if he can strike back with his army

6
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,420
and defeat the tartars

7
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:24,581
credit for canton will be yours

8
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,418
one must sacrifice for one's country

9
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,750
the six brothers arrested by tartars

10
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,952
were tortured but have so far

11
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,455
refused to make a confession

12
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:41,045
this is most admirable

13
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:44,579
if I failed

14
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,625
I wouldn't even get arrested

15
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:48,172
general yin

16
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,837
Mr. ho, please

17
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:24,714
Sirs

18
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:30,419
when inspector-general and general tien ta

19
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:36,208
arrive, please say a good word for me

20
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,917
don't worry, Mr. magistrate

21
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:43,292
general tien ta ordered us

22
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,454
to capture the six traitors

23
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:48,705
the inspector-general is specially

24
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:52,502
invited to supervise the execution

25
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,620
yes, yes...

26
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,248
Tang San-yao, it's almost 12:30

27
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,461
don't forget the general's command

28
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:04,665
the inspector-general is here

29
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:05,411
make way...

30
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:13,422
Make way...

31
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,589
We're trapped

32
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:09,879
general yin, I knew you'd be here

33
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,417
to "welcome" the inspector-general

34
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:22,036
But he has not yet reached canton

35
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,380
Stop

36
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,586
your skill is comparable to a general

37
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,038
let's have a fair fight

38
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,080
a general to a general

39
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,663
let me try you out

40
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:05,672
good, I need a substitute

41
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,120
Let me fight you single-handedly

42
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,246
Quiet down

43
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:04,577
the teacher's here

44
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,996
the teacher's here, hurry up...

45
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,005
Mr. ho

46
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:16,797
Mr. ho

47
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:18,922
Mr. ho

48
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:40,459
What's it? What's happened to Mr. ho?

49
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:46,787
Mr. ho

50
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,961
Please have tea, Mr. ho

51
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:13,830
Mr. ho, why are you so late?

52
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,249
Did you go to see the execution?

53
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,994
Leave me alone!

54
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,042
Executions should be interesting

55
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:25,703
lin zhen, it depends on who it is

56
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:29,793
if it is the tartars who invaded us

57
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,670
of course it is interesting

58
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:37,953
but today's convicts are patriots

59
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,579
they are all han's martyrs

60
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:43,503
do you still think it is interesting?

61
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:51,244
Yesterday, I taught you sacrifice

62
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,202
for the sake of a righteous cause

63
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:58,129
do you all understand?

64
00:10:58,922 --> 00:10:59,957
Yes

65
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:05,580
hurry up...

66
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:10,787
It's here

67
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:29,287
Is he dead or alive?

68
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,501
He's so stiff, of course he's dead

69
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,537
he's a hero

70
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:42,755
what did you say?

71
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:45,081
Capture him

72
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,089
yes

73
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
you're an accomplice

74
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:52,702
chief tang... listen to me

75
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,921
this student is not a bad man

76
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,459
he's the son of a seafood shop owner

77
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,999
son of a shop owner?

78
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,291
Yes, exactly

79
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:06,789
these are his classmates

80
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,333
yes, we're his classmates

81
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,370
where are you studying?

82
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:15,453
They all study in Chong wen college

83
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:19,332
are you vouching for them, Mr. wang?

84
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:23,710
Yes. Apologize to lord tang

85
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:26,773
you're too young and gauche

86
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,913
always causing trouble

87
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:37,251
Do you know who I am?

88
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:41,119
I do... I do. Tang San-yao, lord tang

89
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:47,245
yes, yes. Let's go, quickly

90
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,045
uncle wang, we didn't do anything wrong

91
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:52,786
yes, I know

92
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:55,205
tang San-yao is notorious

93
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:57,705
for his craze after money, lives and women

94
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:01,167
you mustn't antagonize him

95
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:03,827
as the saying goes, "one must...

96
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:08,043
"Humble oneself under enemy's rule"

97
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:22,500
Mr. ho... please open the door

98
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,047
who is it?

99
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,172
Mr. ho

100
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:31,829
open the door, Mr. ho

101
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,833
Mr. ho...

102
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:40,037
Mr. ho...

103
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,251
What's the matter?

104
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,413
There's something we can't understand

105
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:51,253
so we've come here even at this hour

106
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:55,085
"humble oneself under enemy's rule"

107
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:56,875
do we and our children have to

108
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,747
humble ourselves forever?

109
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:07,167
I say, we'd be beheaded if we don't

110
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:09,788
if we fear not death, we don't have to

111
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,921
you're right. It's well said

112
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,296
one brave man alone is not enough

113
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:21,585
but unity is strength

114
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,626
mr, ho, the tartars are well-armed

115
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,995
we...

116
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,417
Men owes allegiance to his country

117
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:34,209
lord zheng is recruiting in Taiwan

118
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:38,287
he becomes tartar's biggest trouble

119
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:41,706
the manchu emperor has ordered

120
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,750
coastal residents to move away

121
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,330
and to be on their guard

122
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:49,161
Mr. ho

123
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,083
I wish lord zheng could use us

124
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:53,415
the day will come

125
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:56,583
don't you all want to help?

126
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:58,172
Yes

127
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:01,337
good. Come here

128
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:02,339
yes

129
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:11,082
secret documents will arrive by sea

130
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:14,296
I need a way to bypass customs

131
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,415
liu yu-te

132
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:18,208
your family is running a
seafood shop, don't you?

133
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:19,214
Yes

134
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,370
Open sesame...

135
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,745
Shut sesame...

136
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,375
Mr. ho sent us here

137
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,460
good

138
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:52,542
Little brother, you're a brave fellow

139
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,921
Lock it up...

140
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:03,922
Yes,

141
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:04,914
hurry...

142
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,379
Dad, has San li's abalone arrived?

143
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,542
The abalone... go, go now

144
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:12,663
but last time, the sea
cucumbers have been...

145
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:29,630
Ah te, what's going on?

146
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,620
A big order for abalone was placed

147
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,586
I am showing them some samples

148
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,962
so you're in business now?

149
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,956
Ah te, you don't need
to take the whole case

150
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,204
I'm in a hurry to deliver it

151
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:51,289
hurry? Do you know the market price?

152
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:56,207
The quality is high.
Remember to raise the price

153
00:16:57,964 --> 00:16:58,453
open it

154
00:16:58,464 --> 00:16:59,464
yes

155
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,339
Excellent kung fu

156
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:10,619
not really. You'll find the best
at Shaolin temple

157
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,620
Mr. ho, we could invite them to join us

158
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,630
yes

159
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,379
Shaolin monks don't involve
in worldly matters

160
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,417
if Shaolin could teach kung fu to laymen

161
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,497
people could fight the tartars

162
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:31,915
that would be great

163
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:57,166
South gate, mountain yue. Here... it's here

164
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:00,964
general tien

165
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:02,922
arise

166
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,130
come over

167
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,628
Lately, we've suppressed rebels

168
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:18,253
and found this on their leaders

169
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,876
zheng Cheng-gong's edict

170
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:25,704
look, what have you been doing?

171
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,171
There must be many of zheng's men

172
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:33,706
hiding in canton

173
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:39,164
we must capture the rebels

174
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:46,296
and kill them to scare them off

175
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,415
Who's that?

176
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,373
No idea. He's secretive, maybe a spy

177
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,625
I'm innocent. I'm a delivery boy

178
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,995
I've brought dried fish. Look!

179
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:20,172
Shut up

180
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:45,252
Lord zheng, notorious rebels...

181
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,669
Who told you to bring this here?

182
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:53,711
No... why ask?

183
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:05,165
Kid, we can make you talk.
We'll take you back

184
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,921
and torture you with manchu ways

185
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,880
we'll torture you all one after another

186
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,871
see if you'll talk or not

187
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:22,956
I'll talk... don't torture me

188
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,830
I... I say,

189
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,793
there is someone

190
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:45,662
Tang San-yao,

191
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:55,589
go on with the torture if you like

192
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:16,581
Mr. ho, I saw a squadron of manchu troops

193
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,080
there are over 100 and
are patrolling our alley

194
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,620
Mr. ho, what shall we do?

195
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,122
We must keep calm and be on the alert

196
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:31,619
yien-pin, let them hide in your home

197
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:34,249
Mr. ho, what about you...

198
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,124
Mr. ho, Mr. ho

199
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,915
go quickly, go

200
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:40,456
what about you?

201
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:41,954
Hurry up, quick

202
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,995
Master, look

203
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:11,960
please have mercy... please talk to them...

204
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:14,085
Please ask them not to...

205
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:20,619
Quiet! General's order:
No dried fishes can be kept

206
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,374
then...

207
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,359
What's your relationship to liu yu-te?

208
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:27,790
He... he's my son

209
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,380
bring him here

210
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:33,627
he's not home... why do you want him?

211
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,253
We've uncovered many spies recently

212
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,046
one's a teacher; Another's his pupil

213
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,836
liu yu-te's a pupil of that school

214
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:49,796
we'll capture him and torture him

215
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:53,296
sir, our young master won't do such thing

216
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,833
yes! Please have mercy

217
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,336
how do you know he wouldn't?

218
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,170
Let's talk it over...

219
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:06,589
Dad...

220
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,921
Yu-te, run quickly... yu-te

221
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:11,504
young master, run, run quickly...

222
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:14,211
Run quickly, young master

223
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:15,540
you want to rebel?

224
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:19,287
Yu-te, run quickly, run

225
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:49,539
He's innocent... my son

226
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:52,125
liu yu-te, come up quickly

227
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,045
my son is innocent! My son

228
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:07,835
Change your clothes at once

229
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:11,171
everyone in school uniform will be arrested

230
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,375
wonder what's happened to my home?

231
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,336
You two try to find a hiding place first

232
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:16,670
we can find out later

233
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,291
right, let's go now

234
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,915
What has happened to my home?

235
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:30,003
Your home... your...

236
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:31,297
Tell me

237
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,833
all the houses in the street next

238
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,455
to your home have been cordoned off

239
00:24:37,464 --> 00:24:38,499
what about my father?

240
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:01,537
Dad...

241
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:08,128
Don't be sad. It's the same for mine

242
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,790
I wish I had learned kung fu

243
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,337
instead of studying

244
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,580
so I could fight them

245
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:24,577
studies teach us right from wrong

246
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:27,255
what's the use of that?

247
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,913
We can't talk sense with the tartars

248
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:38,707
We can't stay in this town anymore

249
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,538
I heard that the martial
arts headquarters is...

250
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:43,547
Shaolin temple

251
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,045
We're lucky that we made it

252
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,165
let's go straight on

253
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,002
Hey! Did you see a group of men riding by?

254
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:11,207
Why don't you answer me?

255
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:14,589
Go

256
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:31,869
Dismount and chase them

257
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
yes

258
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:35,787
these two must be traitors

259
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,712
one stay behind to watch
the horses, others chase

260
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:39,714
yes

261
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:50,714
Hurry up

262
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
Go

263
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,415
Hurry up

264
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:26,083
Liu yu-te, mount it

265
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:27,714
liu yu-te?

266
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:31,754
Liu yu-te, escape now. Go

267
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:34,495
don't let him get away

268
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:57,339
Liu yu-te, good luck

269
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,252
Please give me some water

270
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,630
Thank you, sir

271
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:26,252
how far is it to Shaolin temple?

272
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:29,577
It's not far, only up the mountain

273
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:33,502
but you look like you can't make it

274
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:37,953
I can... even if I have to crawl there

275
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:44,541
Sit down.

276
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:50,036
I don't think you can

277
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,622
Shaolin monks buy food here everyday

278
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:02,081
their cart is over there

279
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:14,831
Hurry up... do it orderly and quickly

280
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,871
get going, go

281
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:21,994
why is it so heavy?

282
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,836
Yes, I don't know why

283
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:26,626
go. You'll be punished if you're late

284
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,621
let's go, quick

285
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:36,621
push harder, harder, go

286
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,249
Hurry up, park the cart there

287
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:55,629
come and lend a hand, everybody

288
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:56,994
why are you standing there?

289
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:58,415
Come here to help, hurry

290
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:03,248
take this to the kitchen. Be quick

291
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:17,045
Why are you so slow? Hurry up, hurry

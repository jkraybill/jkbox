Pleased to meet you.

00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:27,456

Take it easy, bye.

- [Michael] Bye.

Oh, Sarah, take care, you hear?

00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:53,774
- I asked for a bulldozer, it's coming.

23
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,614
We'll have it done by tonight

00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,075
You tell him.

00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:05,119

- We'll be ready.

30
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,762
- Listen.
- I'm counting on you,Ed.

31
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,306
- Morning.
- Good morning.

32
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:27,433
- Where the hell have you
been all day, Michael?

33
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:28,893
- Dan, the most incredible
thing happened to me.

34
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:30,978
- So what happened?

35
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:31,979
Come on.

36
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:33,063
You got laid.

37
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:33,981
- You know it.

38
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:35,566
[laughing]

39
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:36,692
- Was she built?

40
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,652
- Like a shit brick house.

41
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:40,237
- I think you mean a brick shit house.

42
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,614
- No, better.
- Where'd you get it on?

43
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:42,448
Your place?

44
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:43,449
- The ferry boat.

45
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:44,450
- Ferry boat?

46
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:45,534
I got to hear about this.

47
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:48,370
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,638

50

She was real, I swear it.

51
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:09,808
- Some broad picks you up on the ferry

52
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,936
and you just forget everything.

53
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:14,188
- She never told me her last name.

54
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,899
- If I'm not mistake, you're
getting married in 12 days.

55
00:07:17,107 --> 00:07:17,816
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:24,156
I know, 12 days.

57
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,450
- It's your funeral, pal.

58
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,618
- Yep.

- What's the matter?

62
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:34,625
- I can't find my wallet.

63
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,961
[laughing]

64
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,798
- Don't worry about it, this one's on me.

65
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,925
I'll bet one woman's got your wallet.

66
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,301
- I must've left it back home.

67
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,177
- Come on, Michael,

68
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:47,429
when are you gonna face
reality and grow up?

69
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:50,057
- [Woman] Well, Sarah, what do you think?

70
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:53,727
It's not finalized yet but I
think we're on the right track.

71
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:54,895
- [Sarah] If you say so.

72
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:56,772
- I only deal with the raw material.

73
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,359
Sarah, I like the idea that the 100th man

74
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,988
be a total stranger while the
other 99 are public figures.

75
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:05,406
It's stroke of genius.

76
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,783
And the ferry boat, really brilliant.

77
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:08,826
Absolutely brilliant but--

78
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:10,411
- But?

79
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:11,829
- But it's too short.

80
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,080
Too short.

81
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:14,456
It drops off in midair.

82
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,917
We know nothing about him, about his life.

83
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:18,210
Who's Michael Terenzi?

84
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:19,920
You must see him again.

85
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,089
Get to know your subject better.

86
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:23,549
- All right, no problem.

87
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:25,134
- How will you track him down?

88
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,223
- [Sarah] I'll just whistle.

89
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:32,141
- Good.

- [Michael] Helen!

94
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:53,287
- Darling, you're late, I've
been waiting for half an hour.

95
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:54,121
Do you know we have about

96
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:55,372
a million and one things to do today?

97
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:56,540
- I'm sorry but I just couldn't get away.

98
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,710
- Listen, honey, now did you
talk to the caterers yet?

99
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:00,836
- Yes, they said they'd come tomorrow.

100
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:01,754
- And what about Dan?

101
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,714
Has he found a suit that he likes yet?

102
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,967
- I don't think he'll
ever find one big enough.

103
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:09,511
- I just hope he doesn't
wait till the last minute.

104
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,345
Oh, I wanted to show you

105
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:12,264
the bride's maid dresses I saw today.

106
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:14,016
The most beautiful lime green.

107
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:15,684
You know, everything goes with green.

108
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,603
I even saw green flowers.

109
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,229
You do like green.

110
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:20,606
I even saw green satin gloves

111
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:22,608
and a beautiful light
green tiara with a veil.

112
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:24,651
I already checked on the
sizes and they have mine.

113
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,236
Thank God.

114
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:28,197
I think white weddings
are boring, don't you?

115
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:31,283
- Oh, yeah, listen
Helen, I just remembered

116
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:32,409
I got to get back to the office.

117
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:33,786
- But you said you were free today.

118
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:34,870
- Something came up.

119
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:38,457
- And don't forget six o'clock
for the living room set.

120
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,334
- [Michael] Wouldn't
miss it for the world!

Hello?

124
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,501
- Hi, Michael.

125
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,794
It's me, Sarah.

126
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,381
The ferry boat, remember?

127
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:30,175
- Oh, sure, I remember.

128
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,763
How did you get my telephone number?

129
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:39,226
- Easy, you lost your
wallet on the ferry boat.

130
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,811
- [Michael] Oh.

131
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:41,728
- Michael,

132
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:43,522
I need you.

133
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,609
I want to see you now.

134
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:53,031
Please, come here now.

138
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:23,395
Hello, taxi.

[somber music]

140
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:28,984
Sarah.
- Hmmm?

141
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,111
- There's something you oughta know.

142
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,863
I'm getting married in 11 days.

143
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,283
I'm not gonna change my mind

144
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:38,577
and I'm not gonna postpone the wedding.

145
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,871
- Then give me all the
nights you have left.

146
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,956
11 nights just for me.

147
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,794
I won't ask you for
one single minute more.

[sensual music]

149
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,042
- Michael, won't you
have some more ice cream?

150
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,669
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

151
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:30,295
- What's the matter, Michael?

152
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:32,297
You don't like my wife's
homemade ice cream?

153
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:33,257
- Oh no, it's not that.

154
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:34,925
- Then why don't you have a little more?

155
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,843
Just to please me.
- Mother, please.

156
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,846
Maybe Michael's had enough.
- Helen!

157
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,431
Helen, I understand English.

158
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,392
- It's best he understand how we live,

159
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,935
since the both of you
will be living with us

160
00:12:45,143 --> 00:12:46,353
for the first months anyway.

161
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,688
- [Helen] Father, please.

162
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:50,524
- Michael,

163
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:53,860
our Helen is not going to live
in any bachelor apartment.

164
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:56,571
- We were only thinking of your future.

165
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,992
My husband, Richard, has
bought you a lovely home.

166
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,120
Unfortunately, it won't be
ready for another six months.

167
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,707
Your office thinks it's a wonderful idea.

168
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,292
They're going to withhold
a little something

169
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,628
from your salary every week
for the mortgage payments.

170
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,214
Now isn't that nice of them?

171
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:17,843
What do you say, Michael?

172
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:20,012
- I'm sorry but I have an appointment,

173
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,221
I really must be going.

174
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,058
It's been very nice, thank you.

175
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,561
About the house and everything,

176
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,563
I'd like to discuss it some other time.

177
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,981
If that's all right with you.

178
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:33,859

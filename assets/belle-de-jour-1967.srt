1
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,749
Shall I tell you a secret, Séverine?

2
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,870
I love you more every day.

3
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,592
And I you, Pierre.

4
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,154
You’re all I have, but —

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,793
But what?

6
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,670
I’d like everything to be perfect too.
If only you weren’t so cold.

7
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,831
Please don’t mention that again.

8
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,470
I didn’t mean to upset you.

9
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,990
I feel a great tenderness for you.

10
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,628
What good is your tenderness to me?

11
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,999
You can be very cruel
when you wish.

12
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,436
Forgive me, Pierre.

13
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,799
Stop.

14
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,639
Get out.

15
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,558
- What’s going on?
- I said get out.

16
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,113
But why?

17
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,195
Come on.

18
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,596
- Let me go!
- Come on!

19
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,992
Let me go!

20
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,477
Do what I told you.

21
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,551
How dare you!

22
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,472
Let me go!

23
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,752
You brutes!

24
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,072
Let go of me!

25
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,474
It’s not my fault.
I can explain everything.

26
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,075
Go on.

27
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,192
Don’t worry about roughing up
the little slut! Hurry!

28
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,072
Pierre, it’s your fault too.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,470
I can explain everything!

30
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,956
Shut your mouth, madame,
or I’ll shut it for you!

31
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,239
Stop!

32
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,555
Please tell them to let me go!

33
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,759
Help!

34
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,958
Shut up, you little bitch!

35
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,079
Come on.

36
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,993
Pull.

37
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,674
Don’t scream or I’ll kill you,
you hear?

38
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,430
Pierre, I beg you.

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,437
I beg your forgiveness

40
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,478
with all my heart.

41
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,518
Pierre, please don’t let the cats out!

42
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,031
That’s enough.
She’s yours now.

43
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,196
- Pierre, I love you!
- Go ahead.

44
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,511
What are you
Ihmkmg about, sever/he .7

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,956
What are you thinking about?

46
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,832
l was thinking about you... and us.

47
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,358
We were out for a ride in a carriage.

48
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,192
The carriage again?

49
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,518
I want to kiss you.

50
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,549
- You have an early day tomorrow.
- Why?

51
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,910
- To pack our bags.
- We’re going somewhere?

52
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,189
- Yes.
- Where?

53
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,954
It’s a surprise
for our wedding anniversary.

54
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,711
Our happiness has lasted a year already,
“and the suns of yesteryear...”

55
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,193
What about the hospital?

56
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,430
I want to forget about work
for a few days

57
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,471
and think only of you.

58
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,671
Happy?
- Yes.

59
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,472
Especially when you’re here.

60
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,239
I wish you could be
near me every second.

61
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,798
No, please.

62
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,959
Sleep well.

63
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,393
Good night.

64
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,838
Forgive me.

65
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,229
You’re so good,
so understanding, but I —

66
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,755
It’s all right. Go to sleep.

67
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,395
You coming
to the party at the hotel?

68
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,875
I don’t know.
Husson goes to bed at sundown.

69
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,629
Then come alone.
They say it’s going to snow tonight.

70
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,076
I’d love to see the mesmerizer.
I hear he’s great.

71
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,753
I won’t let him put me to sleep.

72
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,475
A mesmerizer isn’t a hypnotist.
He makes the sun rise.

73
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,791
A hypnotist plunges you
down into the depths.

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Well, see you later.

75
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,398
Bye.

76
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,191
What time is it?

77
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,677
Five o’clock. You look bored.
Don’t let me keep you.

78
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,677
One’s never bored in a bar,

79
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,230
unlike in a church,
alone with one’s own soul.

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
l have something nice to tell you.

81
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,999
I love you.

82
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,679
Thank you.

83
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,916
Your scars heal so nicely.

84
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,678
Oh, stop it.

85
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,198
Let’s not go in.
She’s with Husson.

86
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,833
Too late. He saw us.

87
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,838
What have you got against him?
He’s an interesting fellow.

88
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,394
I don’t like how he looks at me.

89
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,953
Come on.

90
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,358
Evening.

91
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,194
I saw you two
pass by earlier arm in arm.

92
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,198
It was a pleasure to see.
Like newlyweds.

93
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,630
- We must have looked ridiculous.
- No, it was very reassuring,

94
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,228
like an everyday occurrence.

95
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,712
But you, Pierre — you sometimes
make me feel guilty and uneasy.

96
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,031
You and l are so different.

97
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,152
One really doesn’t meet
many men like you.

98
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,837
I mean it sincerely.

99
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,115
Well... thanks.

100
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,272
Another missed opportunity
for punishment.

101
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,755
Why? Do you know them?

102
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,712
Is that all you’re interested in?

103
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,354
Everything else is useless.
A lot of wasted time.

104
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,756
You should see a specialist
about your obsessions.

105
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,395
He’s rich and idle.
Those are his two main illnesses.

106
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,273
Don’t forget the hunt.

107
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,915
I also have
a special weakness for the poor.

108
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,635
I think of them when it snows,
with no fur coats, no hope, no nothing.

109
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,518
You’re very attractive, Séverine.

110
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,955
Your compliments are too subtle,
so just be quiet.

111
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,638
You’re asking the impossible.

112
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,156
I’ve been here three hours.
| feel a headache coming on.

113
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,430
It’s not too cold outside?
- No, it’s nice.

114
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,120
I’ll get some fresh air before dark.
See you later, Renee.

115
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,470
- See you later.
- Have a nice walk.

116
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,950
I like him. He’s amusing.

117
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,879
He’s strange.

118
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,712
Worse than that.

119
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,993
- / forgot to ask how Husson is.
- He’s fine.

120
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,998
- St/Y/ together?
- Afraid 50. Let’s not talk about it.

121
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,274
You remember Henriette?
- Yes, very well.

122
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,912
It seems...

123
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,831
she’s turning tricks.

124
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,349
- What?
- In one of those houses.

125
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,875
They say she’s there
several days a week.

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,876
Well!

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,150
Can you believe it? Henriette!

128
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,759
Of course,
that’s all so far from your world.

129
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,671
But can you imagine?
A woman like you or me.

130
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,115
Can you see her
going with just anybody?

131
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,754
In those places
you don’t get to choose.

132
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,713
Old or not, lousy-looking or not.

133
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,194
Even with a man you love
it can be unpleasant.

134
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,233
It must be horrible with a stranger.
Those places still exist?

135
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,189
Excuse me, ladies,

136
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,830
but I can assure you:
Those places do still exist.

137
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,430
Oh, maybe not like
the joints before the war.

138
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,393
The red lights are gone, of course.

139
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,797
But trust me:
There’s no lack of business.

140
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,350
I could show you a good half dozen.

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,511
Part of my job, you see.

142
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,235
In 20 years of driving a cab
I’ve seen everything.

143
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,036
I’ve been mugged twice,

144
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,310
and I’m none the worse for it.

145
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,391
Hey, what’s the matter?

146
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,079
We’re here.

147
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,796
These flowers came for you, madame.

148
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,951
Fine. Who sent them?

149
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,872
Mr. Husson.

150
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,471
Why did you put them here?

151
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,476
I’ll get a cloth.

152
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,274
It’s nothing.
The water was clean.

153
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,196
What’s the matter with me today?

154
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,591
saver/he, come quick/y!

155
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,390
Are you coming or not?

156
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,072
- Will you be much longer?
- I’m almost done.

157
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,795
Can I ask you a silly question?

158
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,473
Go ahead.

159
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,071
Before you met me,

160
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,272
did you use to go
to those... houses a lot?

161
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,552
“Those houses”?

162
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,069
Not very often. Why?
Does that interest you?

163
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,316
Everything about you interests me.

164
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,189
But I thought
they’d been closed down.

165
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,311
They’ve gone underground.

166
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,630
I can’t imagine how it works.

167
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,593
- Listen, I have to work.
- Please.

168
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,391
Well, you go in.
The women are there.

169
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,398
You pick one.

170
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,988
You spend half an hour
alone with her,

171
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,157
and after you leave,
you’re depressed all day.

172
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,829
But what can you do?
Semen retentum venenum est

173
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,473
Be quiet.

174
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,119
I don’t want to hear
any more, please.

175
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,638
What’s the matter?

176
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,789
I’ve never seen you like this.
What’s going on?

177
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,428
Nothing.
I’m just tired and on edge.

178
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,598
Go get some rest.

179
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,199
You’re right.

180
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,913
Good night.

181
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,429
- Shall I come with you?
- No.

182
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,632
Yes, stay with me
until I fall asleep.

183
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,270
Will you never grow up?

184
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,035
I can’t hit anything today.
Take my place.

185
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,993
- You leaving?
- No, I’ll wait for you inside.

186
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,750
- Hello, how are you?
- Not bad.

187
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,917
- We don’t see much of you these days.
- That’s true.

188
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,633
See you.

189
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,829
The mysterious Henriette!

190
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,236
The woman with two faces.

191
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,110
A double life. How intriguing!

192
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,156
Did Renée tell you?
- Yes. But why?

193
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,351
Simple: for the money.

194
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,999
Most women who sell themselves
do so, alas, for the money.

195
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,630
It’s nice to see you, Séverine.
- I can’t understand women like that.

196
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,030
It’s the oldest profession
in the world.

197
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,878
It’s mostly arranged by phone now,

198
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,793
but the women in those houses
are a special breed.

199
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,151
I’m sure you know them well.

200
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,759
Yes, | used to go a lot.
I enjoyed it.

201
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,634
There’s a very special atmosphere.
The women are complete slaves.

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,389
I remember a few around the Opéra.

203
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,120
Especially one run by Ana'is.

204
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,869
11, cité Jean de Saumur.
l have marvelous memories.

205
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,150
- Are you crazy?
- It’s nothing.

206
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,874
A “cute compulsion,”
as the English say.

207
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,389
An insignificant little impulse.

208
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,915
I must see you sometime —

209
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,996
without your husband, of course.

210
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,476
I admire Pierre very much,
but I’d prefer he not be there.

211
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,150
Madame Anai's,
it, cite Jean de Saumur.

212
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,599
Sévenne!

213
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,956
What’s the matter with you?

214
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,874
Yes?

215
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,474
- I wanted to speak to you.
- Come in.

216
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,153
Good morning.

217
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,629
Good morning.

218
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,070
Are you in charge of...?

219
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,997
l’m Madame Ana'is.

220
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
I came to see if —

221
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,719
Let’s go inside.
We’ll be more comfortable there.

222
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,912
Have a seat.
Can I offer you something?

223
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,189
No, thanks.

224
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,794
- Cigarette?
- Thanks, I don’t smoke.

225
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,477
Don’t be frightened.
Make yourself at home.

226
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,599
I’ll do whatever I can.
Sit down.

227
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,034
You’re nice, and fresh.
Just what they like here.

228
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,239
I know it’s hard at first,

229
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,238
but who doesn’t need money
now and then?

230
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,349
We’ll split it fifty-fifty.

231
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,917
l have my expenses.

232
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,952
Thank you very much,
but I must be going.

233
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,634
Come now.
You’re just a bit nervous.

234
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,594
I bet it’s the first time
you’ve worked.

235
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,110
It’s not really so awful.

236
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,592
It’s still early.
The other girls aren’t here yet.

237
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,756
You’re about to lose a button.

238
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,631
When would you like to start?

239
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,318
I don’t know.

240
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,714
Today?

241
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,638
Yes, perhaps.
But afternoons only.

242
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,070
l have to leave at 5:00, without fail.

243
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,039
All right,

244
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,516
but you must be punctual
or I’ll be very annoyed.

245
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,674
I promise
you’ll be free to go at 5:00.

246
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,798
Good-bye, and excuse me.

247
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,639
l’ll expect you this afternoon at 2:00.

248
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,232
What’s the matter?
Anything serious?

249
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,749
No, l was out shopping

250
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,951
and just suddenly wanted
to see you.

251
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,390
- I thought you didn’t like hospitals.
- No, I don’t.

252
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,797
I don’t feel like being alone.
Let me take you out to lunch.

253
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,390
I’m having lunch with the boss.
I told you this morning.

254
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,795
- That’s true, but —
- I’m sorry.

255
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,034
Don’t forget we’re going out
with the Févrets tonight.

256
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,439
- Sorry to bother you.
- Bother me?

257
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,632
See you tonight.
I’ll try to be home early.

258
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,876
I didn’t think you’d be back.

259
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,753
You left so abruptly this morning.

260
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,759
I thought I’d scared you off.
Come in.

261
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,877
Put your things in here.

262
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,189
You’ll meet the other two girls soon.

263
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,754
Mathilde and Charlotte.

264
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,871
Both very nice.

265
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,633
I only tolerate
well-bred people here,

266
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,876
and they must be cheerful.

267
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,994
I want people to enjoy their work.

268
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,109
Just last week I had to let a girl go.
Very beautiful, too.

269
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,511
But she was too vulgar.
It’s a shame.

270
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,959
Come sit down.

271
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,234
What’s your name?
- I don’t want —

272
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,635
I’m not asking your real name.

273
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,878
You think mine is really Ana'l's?

274
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,479
We’ll have a little something
to celebrate your arrival.

275
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,114
- No, thank you.
- I insist.

276
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,470
Cherries in brandy.

277
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,072
We need to find you a name —
something simple and smart,

278
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,714
and easy to remember.

279
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,195
We can think of one together,
if you like.

280
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,591
You’ll see. He’s very funny.

281
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,553
l have an idea.

282
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,955
What if we called you
“Belle de jour”?

283
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,717
Since you’re only here afternoons.
- If you like.

284
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,356
You look a bit nervous.

285
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,832
Relax.

286
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,633
You’ll be out at 5:00.
Don’t worry.

287
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,316
You have someone waiting for you?

288
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,718
A boyfriend?

289
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,152
A husband?

290
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,029
Oh, don’t think I’m prying.

291
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,959
Kiss me.

292
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,956
The girls are thirsty.

293
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,551
Wait here. I’ll be back.

294
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,838
A new girl,
and you ’re hiding her from me .7

295
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,238
Bring her in this minute
or / ’/i go get her m yse/ﬁ

296
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,873
Belle?

297
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,917
He’s a funny guy. You’ll see.
A candy manufacturer.

298
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,156
He has factories in Bordeaux.

299
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,316
Makes a lot of money.
Come on.

300
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,356
Some night if I have to go without,
I can run to make myself sleep.

301
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,512
The other day in Brussels
I had a black girl.

302
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,835
What a time we had!

303
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,076
This is Belle de jour.

304
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,912
Hello.

305
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,397
I told you to close those drapes.

306
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,154
Belle de jour,
my respects as of 2:45.

307
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,077
Have some champagne with us.

308
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,839
Ana'l's, a bottle of bubbly,
and quick!

309
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,635
You’re lucky. They always open
a bottle for a new girl.

310
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,990
It sounds like you already had some.

311
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,034
Get acquainted.
I’ll be right back.

312
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,079
Pallas!

313
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,312
A hell of a woman, from head to toe.

314
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,431
Forget it. She’s too high-class.

315
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,391
That’s exactly why, sweetie!

316
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,074
Listen to him.
He never gets enough.

317
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,832
What a specimen!

318
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,358
This is pretty.

319
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,155
But you need something
that comes off in a jiffy. Right?

320
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,272
No, I think she’s a knockout
in that little dress.

321
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,312
Very refined.
Just how I like ’em.

322
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,029
You promised me a present.
I’d love a dress like that.

323
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,276
I’m not Rothschild, baby!

324
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,879
Too bad.

325
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,751
What a great cut!

326
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,672
The detail work is incredible.

327
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,314
It’s easy to dress well
when you’ve got money.

328
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,476
But you can’t buy class.

329
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,591
Here’s the champagne.

330
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,591
My throat was feeling dry.

331
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,560
No, let me do that.
That’s a man’s job.

332
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,917
I’m a world champion cork-popper.

333
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,429
A real virtuoso
from so much practice!

334
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,200
/ hire ham and sausage

335
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,278
illire ham when it’s good

336
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,797
But / hire even more
a nice pair of th/ghs

337
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,995
It wasn’t cold enough.

338
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,032
Champagne over 46 degrees
tastes like tea.

339
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,237
Sorry. If I’d known,
I’d have put it in the fridge.

340
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,797
- You knew I was coming.
- But not that Belle de jour was.

341
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,152
To the person
I care most about — me!

342
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,271
And to Belle de jour.

343
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,437
Good, but a little warm.

344
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,231
Mathilde, | forgot.
I do have a present for you.

345
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,279
Here.
- What is it?

346
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,072
Open it and see.

347
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,039
Thank you.

348
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,833
He’s funny.
He always has some surprise.

349
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,871
Here’s to fun!

350
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,759
I love life!
I like people to have fun!

351
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,191
Well, Belle de jour?

352
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,552
You in a bad mood?

353
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,238
What’s the matter?

354
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,598
You’ll see.

355
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,472
I’ll show you a good time, I promise.

356
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,799
What’s with her?

357
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,911
Give me a minute with her.

358
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,196
We mustn’t rush her.
It’s her first time.

359
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,596
- I’ve heard that before!
- It’s true, I swear.

360
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,236
- Who does she think she is?
- She’s just new.

361
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,710
You’re doing fine.
You’re a big hit already.

362
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,071
Mr. Adolphe is a simple man,
so don’t get upset.

363
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,239
Do what he wants.
That’s all he asks.

364
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,476
- No, I want to go.
- What?

365
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,954
You about done putting on airs?
Where do you think you are?

366
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,559
Go on.

367
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,718
Yes, ma’am. I’m going.

368
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,876
Leave me alone, you two.

369
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,840
Seems you need a firm hand, eh?

370
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,319
Go on.

371
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,119
Hi there.

372
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,392
Close the door.

373
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,039
Come here.

374
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,594
I sent the others away.
More intimate that way.

375
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,033
Now, then...

376
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,318
it seems it’s your first time?

377
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,153
Careful!
l have a nose for these things.

378
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,271
Don’t try to fool me.

379
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,914
But if it’s true,

380
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,631
there’s no need to be ashamed.

381
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,632
You’re not telling me
you’re still a virgin at your age, eh?

382
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,831
But we’ll soon find out.

383
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,996
What? Do I scare you?

384
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,870
Don’t like my face?

385
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,348
Better get used to it,
my little friend.

386
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,839
No, you’re not running off now!

387
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,151
Who do you think you are,
you little slut?

388
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,999
You get me excited
and then pull me up short?

389
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,239
You can put on airs for a while,
but I’ve had enough!

390
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,073
There.

391
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,833
See?

392
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,312
That’s more like it.

393
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,593
So...

394
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,188
you need the rough stuff, do you?

395
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,719
Jack of clubs, my gin card.

396
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,670
Mr. Adolphe
is sure taking a long time.

397
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,313
He always does.

398
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,033
Gin.

399
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,791
Séverine, where are you?
Are you ready?

400
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,038
You’re in here?

401
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,720
What’s the matter?
Is something wrong?

402
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,278
Are you ill?

403
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,711
You don’t have a temperature.

404
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,392
Shall I send for someone?
- No, it’s nothing.

405
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,112
l was sleeping.

406
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,595
I had a headache.
I don’t know why.

407
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,838
I took an aspirin and a hot bath.
l’ll feel better tomorrow.

408
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,598
What time is it?

409
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,153
lt’s late.

410
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,635
I’ll call the Févrets to cancel.

411
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,035
- You go by yourself.
- Absolutely not.

412
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,789
I’ll be much better here.
Anyway, I have work to do.

413
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,391
Get some rest. Good night.

414
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,038
/s the soup ready?

415
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,192
It’s cold,
and I can’t warm it up.

416
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,557
Are bulls given names like cats?
- Sure.

417
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,115
Most of those are called Remorse.

418
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,313
Except the last one.
His name is Expiation.

419
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,919
What time is it?

420
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,470
Between 2:00 and 5:00,
but not later than 5:00.

421
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,719
- How’s your wife?
- Very well, thanks.

422
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,910
- Where is she?
- Right over there.

423
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,315
Want to say hello?
- I’d love to.

424
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,271
How are you, little slut?

425
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,789
Everything okay, you tramp?

426
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,593
Old whore!

427
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,113
Maggot!

428
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,349
Sodomite!

429
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,833
Scum!

430
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,154
Fellatomane!

431
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,635
Trollop! Harlot!

432
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,076
Pierre, please stop!
I love you!

433
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,316
Just what do you want?

434
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,632
I wanted —

435
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,716
Your job back?

436
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,594
So you can disappear again
for a week without a word?

437
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,955
I won’t have amateurs here.
That’s what the streets are for.

438
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,792
Please, madame.

439
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,396
You’re lucky you’re dealing with me.

440
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,156
Some others would slam
the door in your face.

441
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,996
I’m too soft.

442
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,550
But if you come back,
you have to be serious about it.

443
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,755
Yes.

444
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,916
Can I count on you every day?

445
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,156
Yes, but only until 5:00.

446
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,039
Go on in.

447
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,513
Hello, madame.
Nice to see you again.

448
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,191
lt’s Belle de jour.
How are you?

449
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,555
- Fine, thanks.
- You ran out on us.

450
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,114
- Why didn’t you come back sooner?
- I couldn’t.

451
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,589
- Give me your coat.
- Thank you.

452
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,713
It’s so nice.
Say, may I ask a favor?

453
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,515
Could I borrow it this Sunday?
I’ll bring it back Monday.

454
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,234
Listen, I hate to say no,

455
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,670
but Sunday wouldn’t work so well,
because —

456
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,831
Don’t worry.
l’m seen it in ready-to-wear.

457
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,952
Carducci! Only the best, eh?

458
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,398
Who are you?

459
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,835
Was it tough coming back?

460
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,713
I do this because of my fiancé.

461
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,997
He was hurt in a cycling accident
and can’t work.

462
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,510
He knows I come here.
But I really love him.

463
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,314
Of course,
I could make a living elsewhere.

464
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,193
- And how much would you make?
- That’s true.

465
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,393
The Professor
will be here any minute.

466
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,633
l’ll introduce you.
You’re just his type.

467
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,875
Who is he?

468
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,838
A gynecologist.
Apparently a big name.

469
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,718
With an international clientele.

470
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,633
Did an operation in Copenhagen
just two months ago.

471
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,838
There he is.

472
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,389
Fill her in.
- Yes, madame.

473
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,635
Time to turn the lights on already.

474
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,350
You’ll see, it’s easy.
If they were all like him...

475
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,910
l have a new girl.
I think you’ll like her very much.

476
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,157
A little shy, perhaps,
but a real aristocrat.

477
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,311
- Really?
- Would I lie to you?

478
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,670
Very well. Send her in.

479
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,151
Go on in, please.

480
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,679
- What are you doing?
- l was —

481
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,149
Didn’t they tell you?
Get dressed!

482
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,793
Come in.

483
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,877
The marquise called?

484
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,439
Yes.

485
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,069
lsn’t her ladyship satisfied
with my services?

486
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,953
Well...

487
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,713
no, not really.

488
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,630
- Madame Ana'l's?
- Yes?

489
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,149
You belong in the kitchen,
younglady.

490
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,315
She’s no good.
Get me Charlotte, quickly!

491
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,078
Right away.

492
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,073
Come along.

493
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,551
Charlotte,
go in to the Professor right away.

494
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,756
Just a secono’.
/’m getting undressed

495
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,071
Go inside.
It’s not brain surgery!

496
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,679
Come here.

497
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,270
Watch carefully what Charlotte does,

498
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,431
and don’t make a sound.

499
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,399
Come in.

500
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,428
- The marquise called?
- Yes, Victor.

501
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,949
lsn’t her ladyship satisfied
with my services?

502
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,469
You’re always making mistakes.

503
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,039
It’s true, I admit it.

504
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,951
But the marquise is so good,

505
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,674
so kind,
and especially so beautiful.

506
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,313
lnsolent man!

507
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,559
Look here.

508
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,468
Are you blind? Can’t you see?

509
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,471
There’s dust everywhere.

510
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,393
There, there, and there!

511
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,833
I broke a vase.

512
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,270
A vase? Now I’ve had enough!

513
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,470
This time you’re fired!

514
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,192
No, I beg you, Marquise,
keep me on.

515
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,596
Give me another chance.
I’ll be very careful, I swear!

516
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,152
- Not yet! Give me that.
- Sorry.

517
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,955
Her ladyship can punish me
if she wishes.

518
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,750
Let her beat me,
but she mustn’t fire me.

519
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,677
What are you doing?
You dirty old man!

520
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,796
Nothing.
I’m not doing anything.

521
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,150
I keep my distance, alas.

522
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,795
I shouldn’t tell you this.
It’s a secret, Marquise.

523
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,356
I love you.
- What!

524
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,519
I love you.

525
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,274
I love you, I tell you.

526
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,513
Now walk on me.

527
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,756
Spit on me. Stomp on my face.

528
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,315
Dirty old man! Pig!
l’ll teach you!

529
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,637
But / love you/

530
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,278
Marquise. . .

531
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,431
hit me harder/

532
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,314
Come along.
Someone’s waiting.

533
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,676
Well, did you watch?
What do you think?

534
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,510
How can anyone sink so low?

535
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,913
You might be used to it,
but it disgusts me.

536
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,391
No, sir, not me!

537
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,953
What about her?

538
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,718
Will she do?

539
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,432
What’s that?

540
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,910
“Credit card. Geisha Club.”

541
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,590
This is no good here.
Cash only.

542
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,398
All right. Go on.

543
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,796
No afraid!

544
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,996
- Did you behave and study hard?
- Yes, Mother.

545
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,749
Say hello to your godmother
and show her your grades.

546
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,598
Hello, Cathy. How are you?

547
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,792
Show me your report card.

548
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,232
No hello for me?

549
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,918
Hello, Miss Mathilde.

550
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,559
Hello, you.

551
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,190
Shall we go to the fair on Sunday?
Happy now?

552
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,240
A seven in history,
and a nine in speech. Good.

553
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,072
Madame Ana'l's!

554
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,556
What?

555
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,035
The Professor wants an inkwell.

556
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,068
- What’s going on?
- He wants an inkwell.

557
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,918
An inkwell?

558
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,591
As if /’d have one!

559
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,352
- Go upstairs and do your homework.
- Yes, Mother.

560
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,354
That man would scare me too.

561
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,840
It must be hard sometimes.

562
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,150
What would you know, Pallas?

563
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,198
May I, miss?

564
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,992
Certainly.

565
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,793
- Miss or Mrs.?
- Miss.

566
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,673
Perfect.

567
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,598
What’s your name?

568
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,914
Belle de jour.

569
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,792
Charming.

570
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,510
I once had a cat
named Dark Beauty.

571
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,356
Do you come here often?

572
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,991
Every day in my thoughts.

573
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,631
Lovely morning, isn’t it?

574
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,598
It really is.

575
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,277
Nothing I like more
than the autumn sun.

576
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,392
The black sun.

577
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,397
Black sun?

578
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,551
I think you’re very elegant.

579
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,119
Thank you.

580
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,397
Do you like money?

581
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,994
Yes.

582
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,273
I’d give you a lot
to come to my house.

583
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,752
- Your house?
- For a sort of religious ceremony.

584
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,590
A very moving one
that means a lot to me.

585
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,794
What can I say?
I’m from another era,

586
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,673
when people still had
a feeling for death.

587
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,633
If you’d accept,
I’d be a very happy man.

588
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,672
You’re just the girl I’m looking for.

589
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,591
I live an hour from Paris.

590
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,439
Here’s my card.

591
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,751
I’ll meet you at the station.

592
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,797
Put this on, please.

593
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,751
What’s this all about?

594
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,279
You needn’t be afraid.

595
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,835
All the girls before you
would love to come back,

596
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,152
but the duke is very strict
on that point.

597
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,111
If you’d kindly follow me.

598
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,633
This way.

599
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,559
This way.

600
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,670
I brought you some lilies.

601
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,391
You loved them so.

602
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,071
How beautiful you are.

603
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,195
Your skin is even fairer.

604
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,910
Your hair is even softer.

605
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,791
My beloved daughter.

606
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,591
Your face is cold.

607
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,711
Remember how we played
together only yesterday?

608
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,310
We laughed and sang.

609
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,435
Now you lie there,
mute and motionless.

610
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,471
I hope you’ve forgiven me.

611
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,748
It wasn’t my fault.
I loved you too much.

612
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,313
Duke, shall I let the cats in?

613
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,795
To hell with you and your cats!

614
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,352
We’re alone.

615
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,111
The doors are closed.

616
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,278
Now...

617
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,395
your eyes will never open again.

618
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,670
Your limbs are stiff...

619
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,436
worms are eating your heart...

620
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,269
and this heady fragrance
of dead flowers...

621
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,035
this heady fragrance
of dead flowers...

622
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,909
You’re still here?
What are you waiting for?

623
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,951
It’s raining!

624
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,639
So?

625
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,350
Get the hell out of here!

626
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,073
Out!

627
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,878
Are you almost done?

628
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,479
Coming.

629
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,591
Shall I get in with you?

630
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,679
I only wish you’d do this more often,
of your own free will.

631
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,793
I will, Pierre.
Just give me time.

632
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,435
I always feel like I’m forcing you.

633
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,478
You mustn’t think that.

634
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,797
I want to be alone with you
more every day.

635
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,916
You don’t frighten me anymore.

636
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,759
I feel like I understand you better,

637
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,916
like I’m getting closer to you.

638
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,995
I love you more every day,
you know.

639
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,112
Good day.
Is the lady of the house in?

640
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,948
- Who should I say is calling?
- Mr. Husson.

641
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,630
Mr. Husson is here to see you.

642
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,191
Tell him I’m not in.

643
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,317
Good-bye, and thank you.

644
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,836
You’re very attractive, Séverine.

645
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,829
Frankly, I’d like to write you a letter.
- I’d like that.

646
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,357
Would you let me?

647
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,670
There are so many people around.
- All the better.

648
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,075
I’ll have to give you a receipt.

649
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,038
l’m counting on it.

650
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,196
- With this?
- Yes.

651
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,558
What are they doing?

652
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,312
Nothing. Just having fun.

653
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,913
Take a look.

654
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,871
No, just tell me.

655
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,594
- He’s taking out an envelope.
- And?

656
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,279
It’s a packet of lily seeds!

657
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,553
| see.

658
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,389
New York Hera/d Tr/bune/

659
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,995
- What floor?
- Fourth, please.

660
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,958
Excuse me.

661
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,317
What are you doing?

662
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,156
Help!

663
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,948
Don’t do anything stupid.
You’re crazy.

664
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,591
Hurry up! Quick!

665
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,833
Well, well... Hippolyte.

666
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,554
Hello, Ana'is. Can we come in?

667
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,839
Of course.

668
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,873
That way.

669
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,229
- It’s Hippolyte.
- The Span/ard?

670
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,555
I hoped we’d gotten rid of him.

671
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,155
He’s with some guy
I don’t recognize.

672
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,548
Who’s Hippolyte?

673
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,473
Wait and see.
An odd sort of guy.

674
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,237
When he has money,
he throws it around.

675
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,073
And when he’s broke,
he wants it for free.

676
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,354
Come on, girls.
All three of you.

677
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,594
- How’s the little girl?
- Fine, sir.

678
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,716
Big enough to be tickled yet?

679
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,479
I don’t know.
She has to finish school.

680
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,278
Terrific!

681
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,235
- Only the best.
- Hello.

682
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,436
Hello, Mr. Hippolyte.

683
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,029
- Buen ganao.
- What’s that mean?

684
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,839
How are things?

685
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,394
- Fine, and you?
- Getting by.

686
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,989
We haven’t seen you in months.

687
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,596
- We’ve missed you a lot.
- Really?

688
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,909
Where have you been?

689
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,117
Traveling, in New York...

690
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,712
business.

691
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,352
Put three bottles on ice.
The good stuff.

692
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,279
My best.

693
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,597
From Paris straight to heaven...

694
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,032
What I miss most abroad
is French champagne...

695
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,910
and sexy gals like you.

696
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,590
I brought a friend along.

697
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,838
Be sure you treat him well.

698
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,916
Of course, Mr. Hippolyte.

699
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,517
When we’re alone,
I have a new joke for you.

700
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,677
You’ll love it.
- Keep it to yourself, honey.

701
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,314
- Your loss.
- Cow.

702
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,992
Get off. You’re too heavy.

703
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,388
Well!

704
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,911
And you’re scratching me.
Beat it.

705
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,508
Come here, new girl.

706
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,911
Now...

707
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,672
Let me have her.

708
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,154
Take her if you want
and have fun, kid.

709
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,276
You should at your age.

710
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,039
Thanks.

711
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,198
l’d slit my father’s throat for less,
but friendship comes first.

712
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,915
We’re not gonna fight
over some slut, eh?

713
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,757
Your friend seems shy.

714
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,711
Shy isn’t the word.

715
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,032
The champagne’s cold.
Anyone thirsty?

716
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,833
What’s your name?

717
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,473
Belle de jour.

718
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,279
What else?

719
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,829
That’s it.

720
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,632
Don’t trust me?

721
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,031
I want to know your name.

722
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,233
- Belle de jour.
- Why? Aren’t you here at night?

723
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,231
What do you do then?

724
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,358
Nice boots.

725
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,833
Your teeth...

726
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,513
What happened?

727
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,031
Knocked out in one blow.

728
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,759
You mind?

729
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,590
Then get to it. I’m in a hurry.

730
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,915
How old are you?
- Twenty-three.

731
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,076
- Got anyone protecting you?
- What’s that mean?

732
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,350
Are you free or what?

733
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,754
You making money?
ls business good?

734
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,636
- Yes, but —
- Don’t lie. It’s not nice.

735
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,111
No, leave your stockings on.

736
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,349
A girl tried to strangle me once.

737
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,479
Poor thing.

738
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,397
If you like, I won’t charge you.

739
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,472
Naturally.

740
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,637
Plenty of girls
would love to be in your place.

741
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,750
Still won’t tell me your name?

742
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,671
You’re not much of a talker.

743
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,634
Fine with me.
Girls that talk are a pain.

744
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,799
Notbad.

745
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,350
Too bad you’ve only got two.

746
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,959
Let’s have a look.

747
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,594
Turn over.

748
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,436
What’s that little brown spot?

749
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,874
A birthmark.

750
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,071
Shit! I can’t stand those!

751
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,558
Get dressed.

752
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,080
Not cold enough, as usual.

753
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,794
- You read English now?
- Me? Not at all.

754
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,239
Then what’s this?

755
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,839
What’s it to you?

756
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,635
“Aberfan inquiry accused...”

757
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,159
Enough!

758
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,274
Take this to the room.
I’ll be right there.

759
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,671
The other one’s for Marcel.

760
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,751
Who is your friend?

761
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,350
He saved my life last year.
I love him like a son.

762
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,478
Think I’d let him have
the blond otherwise?

763
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,875
What’s her story?
- Belle de jour?

764
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,600
Yes. Is she in demand?

765
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,868
She’s the one they come for.
She’s got class, and —

766
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,598
And what?

767
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,309
- She’s a pearl.
- A pearl?

768
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,430
/ thought you were going to /ea l/e.

769
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,591
/’m g/ad / stayed

770
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,871
/ don’t mind telling you: lilire you.

771
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,792
Look at my hand.

772
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,751
I’m still trembling.

773
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,033
What’s this?

774
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,070
- A scar.
- From a knife?

775
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,719
Maybe.

776
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,312
What are you doing here?

777
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,112
Don’t ask questions.

778
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,833
I’d like to keep you till tonight,
but I can’t.

779
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,156
I like you too, Marcel.

780
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,228
Will you come back?
- Maybe.

781
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,399
If you don’t have money —

782
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,910
Money isn’t a problem.

783
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,512
You frighten me.

784
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,793
See? You’re bored.

785
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,396
I’m not.
I’d just like to get back to Paris.

786
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,155
You can tell me absolutely anything,

787
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,191
but you’re hiding something.

788
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,996
If you tell me what’s bothering you,
maybe I can help.

789
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,758
Tell you what?

790
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,317
That you love someone.

791
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,510
- Someone besides you?
- Yes.

792
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,916
You know that’s impossible.

793
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,351
I suggested this little vacation to see
if anything was tying you to Paris.

794
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,795
l was right.
You want to go back.

795
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,314
You’re always so distant.

796
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,714
I’ve never felt you
really close to me.

797
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,632
I’m sorry.

798
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,277
I suppose it’s my fault.

799
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,789
Does that prove I don’t love you?

800
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,751
I think so.

801
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,156
/ don ’t know how to explain.

802
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,357
There’s so much / wish
/ understood m yse/f, dar/ing.

803
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,357
Things about m yse/ﬁ

804
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,319
What / feel for you
isn ’t about pleasure.

805
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,192
it’s so much more than that.

806
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,518
/ don’t expect you to be/ie l/e me,
but /’l/e ne l/er felt so close to you.

807
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,918
You want to go home?

808
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,196
I’m telling you, I’m not bored.

809
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,430
We can stay another week
if you’d like.

810
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,348
No, we’ll leave tomorrow.
I have to get back anyway.

811
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,838
See you.

812
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,319
Something wrong, Mr. Marcel?

813
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,557
/’l/e seen guys bitten by the bug,
but never l/ke you.

814
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,033
Ah, shut up, WIl/ ya?

815
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,232
You beha l/ed //ke an idiot,
not like a man.

816
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,678
How’s it going?

817
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,515
We waited for you on Thursday.

818
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,237
- So?
- So next time we won’t wait.

819
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,592
- We almost didn’t come today either.
- Really?

820
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,031
Your cut keeps going up.

821
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,469
We’re getting sick of you
and your little thug.

822
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,510
Don’t fight with these punks.
Settle down.

823
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,553
Gentlemen, if you have
something to settle, go outside.

824
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,716
Shut your trap, you.

825
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,758
The snow.
We know you’ve got it.

826
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,396
Now don’t let us keep you.

827
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,799
We’ll discuss that “thug” remark
some other time.

828
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,518
As you like.

829
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,789
Pierrot, another bottle.

830
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,790
- Where you going?
- To make a call.

831
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,319
Again?

832
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,793
Broads... what a curse!

833
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,356
You can say that again.
He’s got it bad.

834
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,590
lt’s cost him dearly before.

835
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,190
But it’s always been his weakness.
Nothing I can do.

836
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,348
Ana'l's? lt’s Marcel.

837
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,398
Any news?

838
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,518
When?

839
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,353
Really?

840
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,152
I’ll be right there.

841
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,989
“Carried his father on his back.”
Six letters.

842
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,155
The third letter’s an N.

843
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,753
“Aeneas,” with A-E at the start.

844
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,316
Ah, right.
That comes up a lot in crosswords.

845
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,192
Belle, it’s him again.
He’s waiting.

846
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,710
Hello. How are you?

847
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,078
Where were you?
Why did you go away?

848
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,836
I had to leave Paris for a few days.
I can explain.

849
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,953
I’ll explain a few things too,
and I’ll leave my signature as well.

850
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,238
Don’t touch me!

851
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,913
Do that once more
and you’ll never see me again.

852
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,791
All right... this time.

853
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,111
I missed you, you know.

854
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,078
I shouldn’t tell you this,
but I waited for you.

855
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,996
I want to see you more often now.
At night too.

856
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,634
I’m here every day.
Isn’t that enough?

857
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,834
You know I’m not free.
- I don’t give a damn.

858
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,277
I don’t get it.

859
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,351
You seem to like being with me.

860
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,072
Very much...

861
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,156
but it’s not enough.

862
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,311
You love the other guy?

863
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,717
Then why are you here?

864
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,319
I don’t know.

865
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,510
They’re two different things.

866
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,191
l’m starving.
Where should we eat?

867
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,356
No idea.
We’ll decide on the way.

868
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,119
I’ll be back at 3:00.

869
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,154
You’ve changed so much.
I hardly recognize you.

870
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,670
It’s so nice to see you smile.
- I do feel much better.

871
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,519
I’ve never seen you like this.
If only —

872
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,675
What?

873
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,110
If only one day you had
some great news for me.

874
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,913
- What do you mean?
- You know very well.

875
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,759
What I want
more than anything: a child.

876
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,149
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

877
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,869
This old thing caught my eye.
I don’t know why. It’s strange.

878
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,197
- Nothing strange about it.
- No, you’re right.

879
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,436
You’re back!
I didn’t recognize you.

880
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,599
Did you forget about us,
you ungrateful devil? It’s been ages.

881
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,235
But you haven’t changed.

882
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,271
First door on the right.

883
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,750
Come on, girls.
An old friend is back.

884
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,593
Well? Let’s go!

885
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,033
Yes, yes, you look lovely.

886
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:11,792
- You’re flattering me.
- No, sir, I remember you well.

887
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,952
I even dream about you sometimes.

888
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,036
I don’t like the sound of that.

889
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,835
- No, I couldn’t.
- I insist. Do me the pleasure.

890
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,274
Hello, ladies. Sit down.
- Thanks.

891
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,790
This is Mathilde,
Charlotte, and Belle de jour.

892
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,157
Belle de jour? That’s original.

893
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,830
Perhaps you’d like some refreshment.

894
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,151
Later.

895
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,117
Nothing’s changed here.

896
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,754
Still the same homey welcome...

897
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,152
the same drapes.

898
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,597
Whatever happened to that girl,
the lion tamer?

899
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,672
I haven’t heard from her.

900
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,588
- And the heat’s up all the way?
- You haven’t changed either.

901
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,836
Look, that armchair.

902
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,513
It was snowing...

903
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,515
The same special fragrance
in the air.

904
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,432
Still jasmine.

905
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,548
I hope you have some time for us.

906
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,194
All my life.
I’m a man of leisure.

907
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,474
Now, then...

908
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,989
I’d like to be alone with Belle de jour.

909
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,796
No, I won’t!

910
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,878
Is this any way to behave?
You’ll stay.

911
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,871
She’s very sweet.

912
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,191
Just a little on edge sometimes.

913
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,393
Happy now?

914
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,519
Don’t tell me it’s coincidence.
You knew I was here.

915
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,153
You’re wrong.

916
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,073
It’s your fault.
You gave me this address.

917
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,513
- You’re wrong.
- Come closer and I’ll scream!

918
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,551
l’ll jump out the window!

919
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,108
Is this your bed?

920
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,117
You disgust me.
I already told you that.

921
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,357
Yes, it’s my bed!
What else do you want to know?

922
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,396
You like being humiliated.

923
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,073
I don’t.

924
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,192
Don’t tell Pierre.

925
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,912
Pierre?
I admire him more and more.

926
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,356
Please don’t tell him.

927
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,155
At least try to understand.

928
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,236
I’m lost.

929
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,796
I can’t help it. I can’t fight it.

930
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:40,070
I know I’ll have to atone
for everything one day.

931
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,750
But I couldn’t live without it.

932
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,109
Fine! Do as you like with me!

933
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,916
No. Not now, anyway.

934
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,397
I guess what attracted me
about you was your virtue.

935
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,630
You were the wife of a boy scout.

936
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,751
That’s all changed now.

937
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,189
l have principles, unlike you.

938
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,119
I won’t tell Pierre, of course.

939
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,473
But I have friends I could tell.
I could send you some business.

940
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,630
Sorry I don’t feel like it.

941
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,751
It really doesn’t appeal at all.

942
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,871
Another time, perhaps.

943
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,639
Who knows?

944
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,751
I won’t take up your time.

945
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,636
This isn’t for you.
Get Pierre some chocolates for me.

946
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,239
Good-bye.

947
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,196
Ready? Go!

948
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,879
Prepare!

949
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,389
Fire!

950
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,590
- He left already?
- Yes.

951
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,952
May I speak with you?

952
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,713
Run along.

953
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,071
- l have to leave.
- When?

954
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,474
Now.

955
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,989
- But you’ll be back?
- Definitely not.

956
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,599
Why?

957
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,390
You could have told me sooner.

958
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,399
Aren’t you happy here?
- Yes, fine. It’s just —

959
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,118
Now I get it.

960
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,359
lt’s Marcel.

961
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,510
He was just here.
He was furious.

962
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,950
Almost barged into your room.

963
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,955
There’s something fishy there.

964
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,911
Has he gotten demanding?

965
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:02,477
Wants you to be his alone,
day and night?

966
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,993
Yes.

967
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,950
It’s always the same story with men.

968
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,630
You’re right. You’d better go.

969
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,034
There could be trouble one day.

970
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,872
But I’ll miss you.

971
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,478
Women like you...

972
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,357
You and I got along well.

973
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,079
It’s true.

974
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:29,034
Let me know how you’re doing.
Call once in a while.

975
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,992
I’d like that.

976
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,196
Is there some address —
- No.

977
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,995
Too bad.
What else can I say?

978
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,068
Madame,
there’s a gentleman to see you.

979
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,918
- Me?
- Yes.

980
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,473
Who is it?
Do you know him?

981
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,478
No, but he says it’s urgent.

982
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,079
Hello.

983
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,514
- Did you bring the catalog?
- Yes, madame.

984
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,915
Sit down. Thank you, Maria.

985
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,110
Not bad, the catalog thing.

986
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,432
I like your little joint.

987
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,869
What are you doing here?
You’re crazy! Go away!

988
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,993
Since you weren’t at Ana'l's’s anymore,
I thought I’d pay you a visit,

989
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,997
see how you’re doing.

990
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,269
- How did you find me?
- Child’s play.

991
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,631
Is this your husband?

992
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,598
Good-looking guy.
A nice fellow.

993
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,712
A lot better than me.

994
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,035
- Please leave!
- Don’t worry.

995
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,196
I won’t make a scene.

996
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,028
I just want to know why you left.

997
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,476
You hear me?
- Be quiet! The maid will hear.

998
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,671
Go away. He’ll be home soon.

999
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,119
I just got here
and you want me to leave?

1000
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,117
- What do you want?
- To see you again.

1001
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,118
Impossible.
I’m never going back there.

1002
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,151
I’ll give you three days.

1003
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,236
Find some excuse.

1004
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,836
I’ll be waiting at the Hotel du Bois
on rue Fromentin.

1005
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,316
You’ll spend the night with me.
- Impossible.

1006
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,874
Very well. I’ll wait for him.

1007
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,675
l have a lot to tell him.
- You wouldn’t dare.

1008
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,199
Yes, I would.

1009
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,830
I didn’t want it to come to this,
but since you’re forcing me —

1010
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,235
I guess it’s just as well.

1011
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,718
l’d decided to tell him anyway.
- Really?

1012
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,030
He’d have found out
sooner or later.

1013
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,509
One of our friends
discovered I was there.

1014
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,069
I want to get it all off my chest.

1015
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,149
Fine. We’ll both wait for him

1016
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,114
and tell him together.
I don’t mind.

1017
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,956
I’m begging you: Leave!
He’ll be home soon.

1018
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:22,913
Don’t worry.

1019
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,278
I’ll leave.

1020
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,192
I didn’t believe you,
but I’m starting to understand.

1021
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,911
Here’s the obstacle.

1022
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,273
See you soon... Séverine.

1023
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:26,311
- Did you see her?
- Yes. Let me have the car.

1024
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,875
- Where are you going?
- I need it.

1025
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,948
Let me have the car, and beat it.

1026
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,476
What are you up to now?

1027
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,392
I said beat it.

1028
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,635
This time you’ve seen
the last of me, kid.

1029
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,633
Oh no, you don’t!
You’re not running off!

1030
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,949
Any news?

1031
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,389
The killer’s dead,
and the police are baffled.

1032
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,120
Either he shot the wrong guy
or he was crazy.

1033
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,276
- Has he been identified?
- Yeah, a common crook.

1034
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:10,278
It wasn’t his first murder.
- Strange.

1035
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,789
- How’s Sérizy?
- Too early to say.

1036
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,911
His wife’s in the waiting room.

1037
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,879
How is he?

1038
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,310
It’s too early to say,
but he’ll live, so try to relax.

1039
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,472
- Can I see him?
- No, he’s still in a coma.

1040
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,868
Perhaps tomorrow.

1041
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,310
You should go home and try to rest.

1042
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,637
We’ll give you an hourly report,
I promise.

1043
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:54,239
Thank you.

1044
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,998
Don’t worry.

1045
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:02,389
Come on. I’ll see you home.

1046
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,275
I sent Maria for the newspapers.

1047
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,797
I know the articles you like.
I’ll read them to you.

1048
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,389
Maria’s very nice,
and she’s so fond of you.

1049
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,796
Everyone’s asking about you.

1050
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:33,909
You’re getting better, you know.
The doctor’s very optimistic.

1051
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,712
You don’t realize it,
but you’ve made great progress.

1052
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,632
Your eyes especially.

1053
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,509
It’s funny.
Ever since you were —

1054
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,150
Ever since your accident,
my dreams have stopped.

1055
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,713
I think it’s time for your drops.

1056
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,517
Mr. Husson, madame.
He’d //ke to see your husband

1057
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,793
I’m coming.

1058
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,478
Hello, Séverine.

1059
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,511
I’m sorry to bother you.

1060
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,671
You want to see Pierre?

1061
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,472
Just for a moment.

1062
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,514
You know, he still can’t speak.

1063
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,632
I know.

1064
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,671
I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner.

1065
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,678
You know how I admire Pierre,
but I was out of town.

1066
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,997
Pretty dress.

1067
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:03,593
You look like
a precocious schoolgirl.

1068
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,232
- What do you want to tell Pierre?
- Everything I know about you.

1069
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,429
What?

1070
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,118
Calm down.

1071
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,313
He’s paralyzed now,
completely dependent on you.

1072
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,715
He’s ashamed of being a burden
on such a virtuous wife,

1073
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,832
so I’ve decided
to tell him everything.

1074
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:29,036
He’ll be hurt, but I think
I’ll be doing him a favor.

1075
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,513
Who could call me cruel after that?

1076
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,152
Take me to him, please.

1077
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,273
He’s in there.

1078
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,872
Would you like to be present
for our conversation?

1079
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,509
What are you
thinking about, Séverine?

1080
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,390
l was thinking about you.

1081
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,273
l’m thirsty.

1082
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,957
- Shall I ask for some ice?
- No, don’t bother.

1083
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,758
I can get two weeks off
this February.

1084
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,394
- Shall we go to the mountains?
- If you’d like.

1085
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,998
Do you hear that?

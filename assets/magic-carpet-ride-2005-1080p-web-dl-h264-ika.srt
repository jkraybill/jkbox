1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,480
Mr. Duralmaz, finish us off, will you?

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,320
Just kill us!

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,920
We'll never get over this now!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,120
Just kill us!

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
Please kill us! Go on.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,640
Or give us a gun
and we'll do it ourselves.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,040
You can't beat people up like this!

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,640
First, we're beaten senseless.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,280
Then they bring us round for more beating.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,000
I think my rib's broken.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
My skull may be fractured, too.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
I tell you what

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
You know the tall guy with the bald head?
He beat me with one of those things.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,720
He's been at it since 4:30.
Look at my leg!

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,040
It's a kind of tube with a chain in it.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,520
Right, a chain.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,640
A chain?

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,000
The chain inside gets you.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,240
The chain's outside!

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,680
You'll be asking yourselves two things.
First, what's a beating?

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,080
And second, why is it given?

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,760
In a routine beating
the body produces two things.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,520
First, fear. And second, ardinal.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Ardinal's a hormone.
It triggers the desire to be beaten.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,520
We don't want that.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,640
We want you to remember
where you went wrong.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
A routine beating is, let's say.
A routine beating.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,880
And a creative beating is

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
let's say.
Being hit by a teacher with a ruler.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,720
You never forget it.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,840
That's the point of bringing golf here.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
Put the ball down, Tiger.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,600
Is golf a sport you can play
with so much noise around?

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,200
Let’s carry on talking.
Let’s explain some more.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,920
Give me number five.
The horses are scared.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Mr. Duralmaz, finish us off. Just kill us!

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,200
Face me sideways.
I want to try something new with you.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,039
In the name of God!

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,480
Magic Carpet Ride

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,400
Now for a news report
on the bag-snatching mafia.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,560
Thieves have carved Istanbul
into territories.

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,600
Thieves poaching on rival ground
are collared by their rivals.

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,640
Their rivals then beat them up
and hand them over to the police.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,120
A gang of unidentified thieves
who broke into a kebab restaurant

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,360
enjoyed a massive 10-kilo fry-up
before making off with

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,480
the next day's supply of kebab
meat, chili, cheese, pastrami and salami.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,400
A man, whose tip-off led to
the arrest of a thief

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,040
was shocked to learn
that his own car was stolen property.

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,640
It emerged he had been sold the car

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,080
with false registration plates.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,200
-You were so rough.
-You didn't complain at the time.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,160
Anyway, when did you start
talking dirty in bed?

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,399
-You're embarrassing me now.
-You said the word for it right out!

54
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,000
You've never heard that before?

55
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,960
No, I have. But it's been a long time.

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,040
-Go on, say it again.
-Not now!

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
Whisper it in my ear.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,360
-You're wicked!
-So? Is that a problem?

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,640
Bad girl! Don't say things like that!

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
OK, I'm out of here.

61
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,360
Tell you what, though.
That bed smell’s interesting!

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680
What does my friend use?
It has to have manure in it!

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,640
Can you please stop calling him
'my friend'?

64
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,480
I couldn't concentrate
because of the smell!

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,520
Or else it wouldn't have been
such a rushed job. You know me.

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,280
-I'll call you then.
-I've heard that before!

67
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,520
-I shouldn't call then?
-No.

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,640
-Right?
-No.

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,880
Right.

70
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,640
-See you then.
-OK.

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,880
-What does your man look like?
-Please stop talking about him!

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
-The jerk's at the door right now!
-Who?

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,680
Lalezar! Open the door!

74
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,880
Then I'll bring a smaller cylinder
next week.

75
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,080
He's not going to fall for that now.

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,480
You want to make me crazy?
Open the goddamn door!

77
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,040
Where’s the guy? Where’s the coward?

78
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
He went through there, didn't he?

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,480
Sami!

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
Don't do it! Don't jump!

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,240
Sami!

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Hey, does this wardrobe
always come in so handy?

83
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,680
Sami!

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,640
-Hey, what's going on, Sami?
-What happened to you?

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
There was this man in my house.
I jumped after him.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,800
He's making a run for it!

87
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,440
Get him! That's him!

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,720
Don't run! Stop!

89
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,920
Yes? Can I help?

90
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,560
Superman, help!

91
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,760
Water!

92
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,520
Thanks. Hello. My name's Asım Noyan.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,920
I guess it would be dumb to ask your name.

94
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
Hey, what's this?

95
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
Before you rang my doorbell
so hysterically,

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,200
I was committing my own suicide.

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,360
Actually, you don't say "my own",
which is partly why

98
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,120
Anyway, I wish you a nice day.
Make the most of life.

99
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,240
Eat whatsit Eat fish!

100
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
And, what was it called?

101
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,200
-Calamari.
-Calamari?

102
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Give me a hand.

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,520
-Yeah.
-Does it fit?

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,920
No, I just tried.
It seemed a bit tight, actually.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
-I see.
-Probably because of the ear things.

106
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,320
-Get down.
-What?

107
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,200
Sit down there. Go on!

108
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,560
Take a seat.

109
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,440
What are you doing, brother?
Are you off your head?

110
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,000
Superman doesn't do himself in!

111
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,560
You have no right to do this
to all those kids out there.

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,320
To be frank, I don't really see
what it has to do with kids.

113
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,240
You do yourself in and what happens?

114
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,360
It's in all the papers tomorrow
that Superman did himself in.

115
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,680
What will kids think when they read it?

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Superman's their idol!
Imagine how they'll feel.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,560
It's all wrong.

118
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,280
You just want to make the headlines
or you wouldn't be wearing that gear.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,240
-No! This is my stage costume.
-Oh yeah?

120
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,880
Well, what do you wear
when you're being a normal person?

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,560
-There's that and
-OK. Get dressed. We're going out.

122
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,280
Superman's doing himself in
and I save him. That's some story!

123
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,240
BARBER SHOP

124
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Hello.

125
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,400
I never imagined
I'd ever be eating with Superman.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm a comedian actually, Amiz.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,280
Amiz? What's with the "Amiz"?

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,680
I’ve never heard such a dumb name.
What's "Amiz"?

129
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,680
To be frank.
I also found it strange, Asım.

130
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,720
-So you're a comedian, are you?
-Yes, I perform in a bar in Beyoğlu.

131
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,120
I mean, I did once. On the bottom floor.

132
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,280
-Yeah?
-Or rather, second from bottom.

133
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,200
It equates to that in altitude terms.

134
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,520
In altitude terms.

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
I've never met a comedian before.

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,120
When I was a kid, there was a jerk
who performed in a tea garden.

137
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,480
I'll never forget what he said to me once.

138
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,640
"Why are you laughing so much,
imp?" That's what he said.

139
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,440
If you did forget,
you wouldn't lose anything actually.

140
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
What?

141
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,680
Well, it's not worth remembering.

142
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,320
He called you an imp, that's all.

143
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
You're not funny at all.

144
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,520
Forget it! You're mean.
You didn't like that memory of mine.

145
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,720
No wonder you're
on the second from the bottom floor.

146
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,560
Besides, why do yourself in
if you're a comedian?

147
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,520
I can't make people laugh.

148
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
But you made me laugh.

149
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,080
-Can I ask you a question, if I may?
-Go on.

150
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
What do you do for a living, Asım?

151
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm in the freelance business.
But it's very free.

152
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
My phone! Stop him!

153
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,240
SOCIOLOGIST WRITER YUSUF ZİYA OCAK
BOOK SIGNING

154
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,360
Kiraz, the man's finished his tea!

155
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,400
Where's that Necati?

156
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,760
Community spirit, underdeveloped
societies and the EU.

157
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,200
Everything with mass exerts a pull

158
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,320
making a dip on the space-time curve.

159
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,880
The force of its pull
is proportional to its mass.

160
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,120
The sun makes the largest dip,
being the largest mass in the galaxy.

161
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,760
And in fact,
this is what gives rise to gravity.

162
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,360
That's the essence
of the general theory of relativity.

163
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
And Einstein's greatest discovery.

164
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,120
He was the first person ever
to grasp the big picture.

165
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,960
Happy Einstein year to you all!

166
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,800
That's all for today.

167
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,400
My bag?

168
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,720
If you can't stop it,
at least get a system working.

169
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,120
Thief boxes for instance.
The municipality could do that.

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,000
"Dear Thief, please take the money
and deposit all ID in a thief box."

171
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,320
I almost forgot.
How did the signing day go?

172
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,960
He said
I should be writing punchier stuff.

173
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,720
-Who?
-The guy at the bookstore.

174
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
-What's "punchy" supposed to mean?
-I've no idea.

175
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
-What did you say to that?
-I said I couldn't punch anyone.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,480
-Nuran, isn't the girl so?
-Please!

177
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,320
You're not about to crack
the Bonus joke, I hope.

178
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Sorry, but everyone does
and I've had enough.

179
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,880
No. I was just going to say how sweet

180
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,040
Bonus? What's her problem?

181
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
Now, with the person we hire

182
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
we're looking for certain qualities

183
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,040
vision and concept, so I mean...

184
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,520
In the first instance,
acting as the company's front line

185
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
when first meeting clients,

186
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,440
which in a sense means
representing the company.

187
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,560
When you say clients?

188
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,680
Our clients are
generally involved with tourism,

189
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,520
overseas or domestic,

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,520
with an interest in the sun,
sea, sand or culture

191
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
or winter holidays.

192
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,680
People visiting our country.

193
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,120
That means someone
who impresses with their English

194
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,680
with their telephone manner.
And so on. I don't know.

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,840
I understand.

196
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Yes, we need someone
understanding. That's first.

197
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
-Second?
-Pardon?

198
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,800
-You said "first". What's second?
-What do you mean?

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Have the boys set up the plasma?

200
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
Yes.

201
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,040
What did you say your degree was in?

202
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,560
English philology. I was top of my year.

203
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,120
I don't like saying that actually
but my mother insists on it.

204
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,880
The guy who came second was nice, too.

205
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,160
What was it called?

206
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,280
-What?
-Your degree.

207
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,240
-Philology.
-What's philology?

208
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,920
English language and literature.

209
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,680
English language is fine for us.

210
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Shouldn't philology be called
lingology? I mean, it's logical.

211
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,480
It is to me, at least.

212
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,720
Boss, our man's here.

213
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,000
Should he shoot him in the leg
and say it's a wake-up call?

214
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,800
No, tell him to go for the head
and say it's a wake-up call.

215
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,200
If the guy does it again,
he'll get one in the leg.

216
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,600
-Boss, there was also the issue of money.
-Mıcır, I'm talking to the lady.

217
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
Excuse me.

218
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,880
Hıdır, look after the lady.

219
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,840
What a cute doll. The one on your bag.

220
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,160
I have a little girl, too. Dilber..

221
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,520
She's only two.

222
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
But you should see her talk.

223
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,440
"Boo-boo", "ga-ga" That's what she says.

224
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,680
She handles the whole world
with two words. What a sweetheart!

225
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,680
Bless her.

226
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,000
I shaved off my mustache
so it wouldn't scratch her.

227
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,880
Don't get the wrong idea,
I'd had it for 15 years.

228
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
I don't get it.
I mean, I didn’t get the wrong idea.

229
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,480
You're a lovely person.

230
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,120
Let's see if there's a use-by date
on these plums.

231
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,240
-Huh?
-We’ll eat it according to that.

232
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,200
Of course there is. It's mandatory.
Here, the use-by date, producer

233
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,520
-And take a look at this.
-For goodness sake, Nuran!

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,280
-You inspected them all.
-Just checking. Is that so bad?

235
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,480
-Hi, it's me.
-Come in, honey.

236
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,839
-She already has.
-Sorry?

237
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,760
She's already inside.

238
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,359
-You're always doing that.
-Doing what?

239
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,359
Instead of welcoming her home,
you tell her to come in.

240
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,240
I'd say that's the strangest fault
you've ever found with me.

241
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,079
-How did it go?
-It didn't.

242
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,640
-The book signing?
-Which book signing?

243
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,520
-You don't want to remember.
-What are you talking about?

244
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,120
-And my bag was stolen.
-What! Where?

245
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
-In the classroom. During class.
-Oh no!

246
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,920
-Umut, don't eat those unwashed.
-So, everything's gone.

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,880
She only has to file a report
with the local authorities.

248
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,680
Good evening, Professor.
This arrived for you today.

249
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,880
-Thanks, Mefrika.
-No problem.

250
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,800
Good bye.

251
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,080
-What is it?
-It's for you.

252
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,160
-What's it telling me?
-Wait, let me read it.

253
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,520
It says, "Dear Yusuf Ziya Ocak,

254
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
We are so pleased that you will..."

255
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,560
-They've bought your book!
-What?

256
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,040
They've bought your book, Community
spirit, underdeveloped societies...

257
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,000
For 20,000 Euros.

258
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,520
It's not Euros any more.
It's pronounced "Avros." They changed it.

259
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
Through a cabinet ruling.

260
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,920
Dad, what's your problem?
It says 20,000 Euros here!

261
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,440
-And look, here's the check.
-Check? Let me see.

262
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,920
No one came for the signing but...

263
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
So, what’re we buying me?

264
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,040
-Nuran!
-Hang on! Wait!

265
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
-For sale owner direct.
-What's that?

266
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,480
First, we put an ad in the paper
and find a buyer.

267
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,960
Then we steal whatever he wants
and sell it to him.

268
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,960
-You mean, car theft.
-Yes, but it's nicer the way I put it.

269
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,000
The guy comes home for lunch!

270
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,600
We're not in the backwoods here.
Why can't he grab a sandwich?

271
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,640
They chased me through two blocks!

272
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

273
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,120
-Asım, it's just a joke.
-What's just a joke?

274
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,480
I’ve never seen anything so moronic.

275
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,320
It turns out the guy's a prosecutor.

276
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,760
-What guy?
-He can explain it. Come and tell him.

277
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,920
What prosecutor? You mean the retired guy?

278
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,800
I talked to the guy on the phone.

279
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
He said he was a retired civil servant.

280
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,480
How could I have known
he'd be a prosecutor?

281
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,800
I also object to the word 'moronic'.

282
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,840
-Shut up!
-OK. What's the story then?

283
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,040
We get in the car and drive off.

284
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,320
There’s a month until I get my bonus.
I'm planning a whole new life.

285
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,880
-You know why I want an estate?
-Why?

286
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,520
I want to go on family picnics
as often as possible.

287
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,080
I've never done any fishing
but I own two rods now.

288
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,080
Oh, the kids don't know.
The car's a surprise for them.

289
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
I like the car, really I do.

290
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,160
But how about I give you
a check for a month's time?

291
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,120
Why not?

292
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
-Well?
-I got out at the first lights and ran.

293
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
So you left the car with him.

294
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,480
That wasn't too clever.

295
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,440
You could have shaken off
the prosecutor and saved the car.

296
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,720
-How do you mean?
-Like this.

297
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,280
Sir, would you like to take the wheel?

298
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,480
-After all, justice is supreme.
-OK. Let's have a go then.

299
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,720
Bravo! You see? A brain that works!
And you go and leave the car!

300
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
Who’s this guy?

301
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,360
-Let me introduce you. Superman.
-"Superman"?

302
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
A regular Superman.

303
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,080
Right. The Superman we know and love.

304
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,400
Why didn't you say so before?
We're fellow-countrymen.

305
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
The whole gang here is from Krypton!

306
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,160
My name's Samet.

307
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,760
Superman is just a character
I try to impersonate on stage.

308
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,640
-He does your head in!
-Yes, sometimes.

309
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,840
Superman, if you have a family,
tell them you're with me tonight.

310
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,240
This guy's sense of humor’s
going to kill me!

311
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,920
Where do you find these jokes?
Unbelievable!

312
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,600
Now Samet,

313
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,600
I got to know İbrahim
through the steel business.

314
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,840
Then we became good friends.
I'm not trying to flatter him, but

315
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,280
he's a true gentleman.

316
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,400
He's decent. He's a good laugh.

317
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,720
-And he's good-looking, right?
-In my opinion, he's not that..

318
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,800
-Right, Tugay?
-Awesome. He has electricity.

319
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,360
Right. Good word!

320
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,840
-He has electricity. More than anything.
-Let's not go over the top.

321
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,960
There's that, too. The snappy reply.
"Let's not go over the top."

322
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:28,000
I keep thinking about
which actor he reminds me of.

323
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,360
-It's a foreign actor though.
-A foreign actor.

324
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,600
Sean Connery.

325
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,160
Sean Connery?

326
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
Think of it like this.

327
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,640
Think of Connery's hair. No, forget that.

328
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,480
He has that stubble. Shave that off.

329
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,360
There's his Scottish accent, right?
Get rid of that.

330
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,240
And think of him a bit thinner.

331
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,960
There, that's İbrahim for you!

332
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,680
İbrahim, I'm proud of
every staff member at my company.

333
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,200
And Silvio here has this gift.
He sees likenesses.

334
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,040
You don't, but he does.

335
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,280
Yes, it's Sean Connery.

336
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
-Right?
-Sure.

337
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,200
Right?

338
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,360
Well

339
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,960
You have that old stud's magnetism.
Don't deny it, you do.

340
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,600
Then let's shoot a pilot film
with those girls, gentlemen!

341
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,080
Nice shape. Don't knock it!
Come on, let's go.

342
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,520
Let's go in.

343
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,960
More action there, boys. Let's see it!

344
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Here are my identical twins!
How are things, girls?

345
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,440
What did we talk about?

346
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,680
-How are you, Golden-tooth?
-Wait a minute!

347
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
Look, you have to identify
the dodgy types at the door.

348
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,040
What do we do now?
Shoot the guys? All of them?

349
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,480
Sorry, İzzet. It won't happen again.

350
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,600
-Hey Golden-tooth, you're on edge.
-Where did you find these guys?

351
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,160
-We're into steel these days.
-It's all you're good for anyway.

352
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,040
Those teeth will be mine one day.
Just you wait!

353
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,240
What's going on here then?
How about we liven things up a bit?

354
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,400
Give us some chips, lady.
The supersonic gamblers are here!

355
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,640
Ercüment, there's this Russian saying.

356
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,320
It goes: there's no ugly women,
just too little vodka!

357
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,240
So the customs officer says,
"You can't take this goat through."

358
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,240
And the guy goes,
"It's a dog, not a goat."

359
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,440
"So why does it have horns?"
says the customs officer.

360
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,640
So the guy replies.
"Keep out of my dog's private life!"

361
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,600
Ercüment, you're hilarious.

362
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,320
Enough jokes for tonight!

363
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,160
Ercüment, let's not waste any time.
You look sorted to me.

364
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,960
Sure, if Natali is okay with that.

365
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,120
You want together shower?
You pay extra 50 dollars.

366
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,520
-Shower?
-Shower, shower

367
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,440
This lot have a thing about the 'shower'.

368
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,880
Hey, it's not some national fantasy!

369
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,320
Most of us don't even like water, do we?

370
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280
Right, Ercüment?

371
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay, İbrahim.
I hope you get your own room.

372
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,640
So, who do I stay with?

373
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,960
Well, I thought me actually.

374
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,440
You're not my type.

375
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,680
Go on! I tip a lot.

376
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,960
See you at breakfast, Ercüment.

377
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,400
Breakfast? You want all night?
Then I have to take shower!

378
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,920
OK. You do that.

379
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,920
I tell you what

380
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,440
She's been paid upfront.
If they're late, you're in shit.

381
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,360
Here.

382
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,520
Never work with your lover.
It's as simple as that.

383
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,280
-Yes? What do you want?
-Out of the way!

384
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,840
Ercül! The police are here!

385
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,760
What!

386
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,920
Take them away!

387
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,640
Move it! Come on!

388
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,080
Out of here!

389
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,520
Move on!

390
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,920
The supposed elite, most respected
members of society!

391
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,840
-You're married, are you?
-Yes, sir.

392
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,760
These types really make you sick, chief.

393
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,240
Personally, my stomach's already
turning, dude. I mean, boss.

394
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,840
Of course they make you sick.

395
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,000
They're engaging in obscenities here.

396
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,800
Excuse me for interrupting, chief.

397
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,440
Basically, both Ercüment and İbrahim are

398
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,080
There’s a bit of fluff there.

399
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,760
They're respected businessmen.

400
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,080
Ask anyone in the steel industry today

401
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,320
and they'll say only good things
about them.

402
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,920
-Shut up!
-I'm going to beat him up so bad!

403
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,560
Could we have a quick word?

404
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,200
Come on, let's talk then.

405
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
Thank you so much. I'm very grateful.

406
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,280
You don't have to push!

407
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,760
I keep wondering
why I don't seem to be at home

408
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,440
but I can't work it out.

409
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,160
This lady's pretty but I think
she's with Asım, isn't she?

410
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,880
I asked you a question.

411
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,120
-But that "hush" isn't very nice.
-Shut up!

412
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,400
What are you talking about
for God's sake?!

413
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,680
Look at them.

414
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,040
These poor guys will be paraded
naked on TV tomorrow night!

415
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,200
These tapes go to the media?

416
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,920
There are whole TV shows for this.

417
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,320
They get the adulterers on camera
and broadcast the tapes.

418
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,680
-What's an 'adulterer'?
-Someone who cheats.

419
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,720
You mean we've become
adulterers at this age?

420
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,520
Guys!

421
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,400
I fixed the problem anyway.

422
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,920
But he didn't give me an easy time.

423
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,600
-They'll give us the tape.
-Great.

424
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,720
-If we pay 20,000 dollars.
-Hey, that's a lot!

425
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,480
That's what I said.
Then I got him down to 15,000.

426
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,280
-That's still a lot!
-I said that, too. But then they said

427
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,160
"We'll be going then. We'll only
just make the main news."

428
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,280
-No! Then let's write the check.
-Definitely. Let's do that.

429
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,720
Give it here.

430
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,280
-How much was it?
-If you make it 16

431
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,520
That'll cover the cameraman and so on.

432
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,040
Write legibly, or the bank won't take it.

433
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,480
I don't understand what's going on here.

434
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,640
Russians, police, showers.

435
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,040
Shit! My kidney!

436
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,400
They've cut out my kidney!

437
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,040
-They've stolen my kidney!
-Who?

438
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,640
How do I know? The gang. Look!

439
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,160
Who'd want your kidney anyway?
Here, we washed it.

440
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,040
You threw up the whole night. Supermoron!

441
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080
-You're licking the guy at this hour?!
-Licking him? I'm cleaning up your mess.

442
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,480
How was the surgery, Superman?

443
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,280
Here, this is yours.

444
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,960
-Is that all I get?
-What did you expect?

445
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,680
You had 17 Mojitos last night.
They've been deducted.

446
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,480
Hey, it's good money.
And here's your last Mojito!

447
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,400
There you go.

448
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,880
-Quick, Superman!
-What's up?

449
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,400
There won't be any eggs left!

450
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,400
They fall for it every time.
Were you in charge again?

451
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,680
-No, the guys were. I just did artwork.
-I got it.

452
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,840
I'm leaving.

453
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,400
Tugay, you sell that jeep
for a good price, OK?

454
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,360
Sure.

455
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,240
Do you know any other tunes?

456
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,640
-Arif, you're very sexy.
-Get out of here! Geez!

457
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,800
Cemil, you're never going to do it.

458
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,280
There's a whatsit there.
Have a go with that.

459
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,560
Wait, I'll get us some tea.

460
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,480
I really don't like you.

461
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Let's see.
If we don't like it, we won't buy it.

462
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Why would we buy something we don't like?

463
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,440
-That's exactly what I'm saying.
-No, it's not.

464
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,400
Well, what am I saying then?

465
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,040
It's like the "Come in" thing.
If we don't like it, we won't buy it.

466
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,800
What "Come in" thing?

467
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,920
Never mind.
Just keep your eyes on the road.

468
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,320
I don't believe it!
Are you really a writer?

469
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,120
Yes, but not a writer anyone reads.
I'm a writer who writes.

470
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,000
I can trust you then.

471
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,719
Some people

472
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,120
treat their cars so badly!

473
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,800
I don't have any bad memories
with my White Dove, thankfully.

474
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,199
White Dove?

475
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,679
White Dove.

476
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,120
I see.

477
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
Maybe she'll be your White Dove now.

478
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,239
Hopefully.

479
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,360
We've been to some amazing places
together.

480
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,719
We even went to Bodrum once.

481
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,080
I took a photo of her there.
I still have it.

482
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,560
Excuse me, but if it's so hard
for you to part with

483
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,440
With the car.
Right, Yusuf Ziya? Then we'll

484
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,480
Do I look like the kind of person
who'd sell if they didn't have to?

485
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,000
Absolutely not!

486
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
If you owe someone money.
And that person also has a gun

487
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,840
then you should pay them back.
And pay them back today.

488
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,200
Of course.

489
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,920
It's beautiful!

490
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,240
You like our White Dove?

491
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
It's fabulous! So is the Beetle mine now?

492
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,440
No. The White Dove's yours.

493
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,840
I don't believe it!

494
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,840
Well, good luck
with our first police checkpoint.

495
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,840
Hello. Can I see your papers?

496
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,000
Dad, can you pass my bag?

497
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,200
-Where's is it?
-Have a look there.

498
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
It should be there.

499
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,280
I reckon women are made
for this profession.

500
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,280
So, they're not made for others.

501
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
For other what?

502
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,640
For other professions.

503
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,120
Did I say that?

504
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,240
Yes. In the end.

505
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,640
Madam, we have to impound this vehicle.

506
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,480
Why?

507
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,680
It's stolen property.

508
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
You're both victim and culprit.

509
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Victim and culprit?

510
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,480
-You didn't steal the car, did you?
-No! That's absurd.

511
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,400
I have to ask as you were caught
with a stolen vehicle.

512
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,160
That's why you're culprits.

513
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,800
-But we had our money stolen.
-And that's why you're victims.

514
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,040
As far as I understand, we bought it
from the people who stole it.

515
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,800
Great! You're finally getting the picture.

516
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,480
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.

517
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,040
If you've finished your tea,
we'll take your statement.

518
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,080
But the tea hasn't arrived yet.

519
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,520
You’ll have it when it gets here.

520
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,120
How can you have tea
before it arrives, huh?

521
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,600
It has to arrive first.

522
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,640
-So, I'm to blame for everything.
-That's not what I said.

523
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,560
So, what did you mean when you said,
"You're finally getting the picture"?

524
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,480
Dad!

525
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,560
-Where did you find that?
-In that Cherokee.

526
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,320
-Put it on.
-You look great!

527
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,000
If we all go, we can nick the boat.

528
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,720
And do what? You can't sail home!

529
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,120
What's wrong with a tractor?

530
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,840
It's easy to nick, too.

531
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,520
With a tractor, you have
a ready-made convertible!

532
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,560
Maybe he wants to go
somewhere other than home.

533
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
-By boat
-Sorry?

534
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,280
I mean, he doesn't necessarily
want to go home.

535
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,240
For all we know, he might want to
go to the Canary Islands, mightn't he?

536
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,840
Go to hell!

537
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,600
-What was your name?
-Ersin.

538
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,000
Ersin, you could have been
nice enough to answer what I said.

539
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,760
After all, I did stand up for you.

540
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,520
"After all"? Hayri,
what does "after all" mean?

541
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,000
You wrecked a brand-new fridge
just for the sake of a safe!

542
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,600
-Arif!
-Yes?

543
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,200
-Piss off!
-What did I say?

544
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,120
-Go to hell!
-How about shutting up?

545
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,480
-Go to hell!
-I live there anyway.

546
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,880
Üzeyir, the house seems a bit risky.

547
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,040
They hired a guard
after the last scene we made.

548
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,160
How about we try the school?

549
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,880
Wait a minute! What are you doing?

550
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,520
I didn't think you were that criminal.

551
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,200
No? How criminal did you think we were?

552
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,520
At least not criminal enough
to abduct a small child.

553
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,880
That's happiness for you, Üzeyir.

554
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,920
A house like that.

555
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,040
By the lake.

556
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,080
Actually, a pool would also do.

557
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,400
You won't find a lake everywhere.

558
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,160
A cool blue pool

559
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,880
With reflections dancing
seductively on the ceiling.

560
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,200
A seductive life with a pool and grass.

561
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,920
Like Superman said, the main thing is
you wouldn't be half as criminal.

562
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,600
Maybe then you'd be allowed

563
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,080
to love your daughter like a human being.

564
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,120
That's my daughter.

565
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
Nazlı.

566
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,240
Welcome, Mr. Asım.

567
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,680
Thanks, Mrs. Hilal.

568
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Mrs. Hilal, let me ask you something.

569
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,600
How come a restaurant this famous
still can't make salad?

570
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,320
If you paid the bill,
you'd be completely unbearable.

571
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,920
Perhaps I could recommend the poison!

572
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,200
Did your phone number change?
I didn't get through on the old one.

573
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,120
Shut it!

574
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,280
Üzeyir, let me change your salad.

575
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,400
Asım, I can't do it.

576
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,680
What can't you do?

577
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,880
What you do.

578
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,120
Of course you can't!
You'd go and do yourself in!

579
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,720
If the work's respectable in any way,
I’ll respect it. But I can't do it.

580
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,520
Look around you, Superman.
Look at those houses.

581
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,880
All those people
deserve to live there, huh?

582
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,640
You think they're all clean,
there are no crooks there?

583
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Wake up, Superman! You still have to fly!

584
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,560
He's right, Üzeyir. He can't do it.

585
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,480
But how was I with?
With Tugay's car thing?

586
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,280
Well, there you were first-rate!
Give Superman some  rakı .

587
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,480
Listen, Superman.

588
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,240
I was young back then. Just 15 or 16.

589
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,960
There were these big brothers
in our neighborhood.

590
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,720
İzzet was the main man.
He was a great guy.

591
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,920
I’ve learnt whatever I have from him.

592
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,440
I was there when they pulled off
a coffin stunt.

593
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,840
-A coffin stunt?
-Right. A coffin stunt.

594
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,840
We had a neighborhood idiot. Cengiz.

595
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,480
Look Cengiz, you'll be fine.
Just climb in!

596
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,800
-I'll take you to the funfair!
-The funfair! I'll stay forever.

597
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,080
Good man, Cengiz!

598
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,760
But Cengo, you're dead now, OK?

599
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,480
Come on! Leave it out!

600
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,880
Rest in peace!

601
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,440
-Which way now?
-No idea!

602
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,840
Where do we take this?

603
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,400
Who's in charge of the corpse?

604
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,400
-Where's it going?
-To the funfair!

605
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,240
Asım, come here.

606
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,880
Sit down.

607
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,320
Organized business. Always.

608
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,360
So that day, I said to myself,
"You have a choice, Asım."

609
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,240
-In the coffin...
-You have corpses and head cases.

610
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,600
You're either in the coffin or carrying it

611
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,240
Or you're organizing the racket.

612
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,640
And you? Where will you be?

613
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,120
Either you steal or you're stolen from.

614
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,960
Well, can't we follow up
the number in the newspaper?

615
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,080
Of course they'll have changed it.
But it might have been registered.

616
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,280
You're saying the thieves
have done nothing wrong?

617
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,000
I see. OK.

618
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,800
OK. Goodbye.

619
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,320
-What happened?
-There's nothing we can do!

620
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,800
One day, they'll walk off with
the Bosphorus Bridge!

621
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,080
-Professor, I've found something.
-What?

622
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,680
Look at this ad. You see the number? 7133.

623
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Now look at this one.

624
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,040
7134.

625
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,480
For sale owner direct.

626
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,480
Either someone's selling
a few cars all at once

627
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,320
Or it's our guys. We have their numbers!

628
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,120
-So?
-So, can't we do something?

629
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,520
Like call and take them for a ride.

630
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,880
-What?
-Why not?

631
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,120
What have you done, Ersin?
I don't believe it!

632
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,240
Hey, what have you done?

633
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,440
We're sorry.

634
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,080
Ersin, I keep telling you,
you're not a rally driver!

635
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
Hey, the car!

636
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,280
What's going on? Bring the car back!

637
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,920
-Asım, I'm ready.
-OK.

638
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,640
Remember, you don't want to sell.

639
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,200
OK. Don't keep saying that
or I'll get confused.

640
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,680
So, let's see what you're made of.
You'll do it. I have faith in you.

641
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,360
-I sent off a photo.
-Where to?

642
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,600
A beauty contest.

643
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,400
Where?

644
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
A beauty contest.

645
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,520
-You want to be Miss Shampoo?
-With a bit of luck.

646
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,480
It's from reading that stuff
the whole time.

647
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,360
This car’s everything to me.

648
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,840
No, that was too severe.

649
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,960
This car’s everything to me.

650
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,840
This car’s everything to me.

651
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,480
-How were we doing it?
-Again?

652
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,720
-Yes.
-We've discussed it 50 times already!

653
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,360
Sorry, honey.
This is my first unlawful act.

654
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,200
Luckily, I'm experienced, Mom!

655
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,200
Wait. You're the buyer. I follow
you in the car. I'm OK this far.

656
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,280
If he goes for a drive,
I'm behind you. Don't worry.

657
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,720
-What was next?
-We find out their hiding place.

658
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,760
Just wait.

659
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,240
-If he wants to drive around...
-Mom!

660
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,840
-I'll be in the corner. I'll wear glasses.
-OK, Mom. Whatever!

661
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,240
Whatever! The main thing is
to find out their hiding place.

662
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,800
OK. I'm a bit stressed.

663
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,880
Mom! They're only thieves, not murderers!

664
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,880
That makes me feel a lot better.

665
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,600
Be careful.

666
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,000
Hello, I'm Umut.

667
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,720
Let me say this right away.
This car’s everything to me.

668
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,160
Sorry?

669
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,280
Everything depends on this car.

670
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,600
Sure. In the end,
we’re interested in buying it.

671
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,440
Can I have a look?

672
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,600
-At what?
-At the car.

673
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,920
Of course. Go ahead.

674
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,080
-The car...
-Is the...

675
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,080
-I'm so sorry.
-No, you first.

676
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,080
No, really I'm listening. Please..

677
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,640
-Does the key...
-Excuse me?

678
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
It's too expensive.

679
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,320
-What?
-The car.

680
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,120
But I haven't told you the price yet.

681
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,320
Well, it looks expensive. How much is it?

682
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,040
15,000 billion l mean, 15,000
That's 15 billion up front.

683
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,960
You see? It's too much for me.
I can't buy it.

684
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,760
Wait! We can work something out.
Try driving it.

685
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,400
-You can keep the car for today.
-No. I don't need to.

686
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,480
We'll meet again tomorrow.
I'm quite certain that by then

687
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,840
I'll be able to breathe in your presence.

688
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Forgive me. Don't take this
as a compliment, but

689
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,880
I really can't breathe properly
at the moment.

690
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,280
I mean, please don't think
I'm making advances.

691
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,160
Here's the key.
I'll jump in a taxi or something.

692
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,480
We can arrange the thing tomorrow
over the phone. See you then.

693
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,400
Just a minute!

694
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,960
So what happened?
You weren't supposed to buy the car!

695
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,360
We were going to follow him!

696
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,440
It all happened so quickly.
He just gave me the car.

697
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:04,760
Wonderful! Now we have
a stolen car. If the police turn up...

698
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,160
We’ll say we bought it, Mom!

699
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,880
Right. Isn't it bizarre
how only we're scared of the police?

700
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,400
Are you a parent?
If you're single, will you marry me?

701
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,320
Clear off or I'll call the police!

702
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,960
-You seem to forget the past!
-What past?

703
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,560
Happy with the new man, are you?

704
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,560
-Everyone says he's gay!
-Security!

705
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,160
-What's the problem, madam?
-I don't know this man.

706
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,160
Then I don't know you either!

707
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,360
I've never known you!

708
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,120
Nazlı!

709
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,880
-How are you doing?
-Fine. How are you, Uncle Üzeyir?

710
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,680
-Fine, sweetheart. How about you?
-I'm doing good.

711
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,160
Listen to that cool talk!
"I'm doing good"! How about that?

712
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,600
-Dad, look.
-What's that?

713
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,680
You didn't get me one, so they did.

714
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,120
Look at that now.

715
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,040
Our boys have better ones.

716
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,320
Your mom wouldn't allow it anyway.
She finds fault with everything I get you.

717
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,880
Remember that doll
you could only get in Germany?

718
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,560
She broke that.
Didn't you say she broke it?

719
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,600
She thinks I steal everything.

720
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,360
Don't you?

721
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,400
I didn't steal that. It was Ersin or Rıza.

722
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,640
-Ersin.
-Right, Ersin.

723
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,720
Enough! Your mom doesn't like us
talking about these things.

724
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,040
Dad, put on your seatbelt.

725
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,720
-How does it work?
-You stick it in there.

726
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,960
-I can't breathe.
-She's asleep.

727
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,320
-Who's asleep?
-Nazlı.

728
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,840
She's faking it! Look at that grin!

729
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,200
He didn't fall for it, Üzeyir.

730
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,080
You left the car and didn't get the money?

731
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,560
I'm sorting it out tomorrow.

732
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,160
You're sorting it out
tomorrow. Today's job.

733
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,800
But you should’ve seen her, Silvio.

734
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,280
Have you ever seen a crystal-clear stream

735
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,320
with black pebbles in it?

736
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,280
She was just like that.

737
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,680
You have a favorite cemetery
or can we bury you anywhere?

738
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,960
To be frank.
I don't understand the question.

739
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,560
You'll understand soon enough.

740
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,480
Welcome.

741
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,800
Welcome, boss.

742
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,560
-Nazlı, welcome!
-How are you, Silvio? Sausage?

743
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,120
Don't ape him.

744
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,080
Look, Nazlı. That's Superman.

745
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,120
-What? Can he fly?
-Not yet. He's still working on it.

746
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,480
Look who's here!
Daddy's Nazlı! Welcome Nazlı!

747
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,120
-Suna!
-Nazoş! How are you?

748
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,680
-Welcome, honey.
-Come on in.

749
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,200
-What happened with the car?
-I'm getting the money tomorrow.

750
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,360
-Where's the car?
-With the customer.

751
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,360
-Where's the money?
-I'll get it tomorrow.

752
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,560
Where's the car?

753
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,400
With the customer.

754
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,240
Where's the money?

755
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,880
She's paying tomorrow.

756
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,920
You expect me to sell
stolen goods on credit?

757
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,520
Superman does
what our own jerks don't even do.

758
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,480
My name's Samet, not Superman.
Superman's a joke thing I

759
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,800
A joke, you idiot?

760
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,280
You don't joke in this business!
One joke and you're finished.

761
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,280
Üzeyir,

762
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,280
say you're Superman
and you're up on stage.

763
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,800
You want to make people laugh.

764
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,440
But no one does. What do you do?

765
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,400
You're Superman, on stage! What do you do?

766
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,560
You save someone, don't you?

767
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,360
You grab someone and fly off.

768
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,200
Say you can't do that either.
Then don't wear the Superman gear!

769
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,880
You don't wear the gear
if you can't carry it off.

770
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,400
Look, phony Superman

771
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,560
If you don't get the money tomorrow,
our friendship's over

772
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,040
in a flash, as they say.

773
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,320
You understand?

774
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,280
I...

775
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,240
I think you've made yourself quite clear.

776
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,840
What's this?

777
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,760
The guys' car.

778
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,600
They said we could keep it.

779
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,480
Have you lost your minds?
You're playing with gangsters!

780
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,360
-What are you trying to do?
-They tricked us, didn't they?

781
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,520
-They made fools of us.
-So?

782
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,320
If this business is about brain power,
we have more of it than they do.

783
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,800
The honest should be as bold
as the dishonest as they say.

784
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,560
We're the boldly honest, Dad.
And we can fool them.

785
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,200
Yusuf Ziya,
I specialize in quantum physics.

786
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,160
-I can also handle a car thief.
-Quantum physics! You're plain mad.

787
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,920
-Dad, can you calm down?
-Try telling your mother that!

788
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,400
I'm the calmest person here!

789
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,440
I haven't even joined in
this argument. Well hardly.

790
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,680
OK, we'll leave the car somewhere.
Anywhere.

791
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,800
The police will find it, whatever...

792
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,920
Just get the keys.

793
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,400
Then we have the gangsters after us.

794
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,920
They have Umut's number!
In the end, we're stealing their car.

795
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,880
And they stole it from someone else.

796
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,600
Do you always have to stress
this pointless detail?

797
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,240
OK, Dad. Can we calm down?

798
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,680
I'll return the car tomorrow
and just say we didn't like it.

799
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,440
But if you ask me,
we should carry on with the attack!

800
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,360
What attack for goodness sake?
Where's it going to get you?

801
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,000
-We'll get our money back!
-We've talked about that!

802
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,400
Meeting’s fine,
but we're telling the police.

803
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,360
-So, we get the guys caught?
-Yes. That's normal, isn't it?

804
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,960
I have a problem with what's normal
in this country these days!

805
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,000
It's normal to have your bag stolen

806
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,720
Normal to have thieves break in
while you're at home

807
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,960
Even normal to have your car
stolen at police checkpoints!

808
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,800
Everything,
dear Yusuf Ziya is quite normal!

809
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,560
It's only abnormal that we're trying
to get our money back!

810
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:04,760
-We have to go to the police.
-Fine. But will we get our money back?

811
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,920
-Look at this!
-You're crazy.

812
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,120
-Where's the moron?
-Which moron?

813
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,520
I asked where the moron was, Hayri.
Are you deaf?

814
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,320
Cool it, sister! He's in there.

815
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,920
Don't call me "sister".

816
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,480
Üzeyir, didn't I tell you she'd show up?

817
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,280
Why are you yelling?

818
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,240
How many times have I told you
not to yell in front of people?

819
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,560
-Where's my daughter?
-Why the hysterics, Nergis?

820
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,080
-I’m her father.
-I said, where's my daughter?

821
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,120
Where's the tooth man?

822
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,880
-Dental surgeon!
-Well, surgeon then.

823
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,800
-He's waiting in the car.
-Couldn't he handle coming in?

824
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,040
He might’ve if you hadn't punched him.

825
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,160
-He called me a thief.
-Aren't you?

826
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,920
That's none of his business.
At least I'm a good thief.

827
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,120
-His tooth jobs are crap.
-How do you know?

828
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,520
If I smash someone's teeth in,
I send them right to him.

829
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,000
He botches the fillings.

830
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,000
That's the difference between you.

831
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,000
You smash teeth. Semih fixes them.

832
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,920
You moron!

833
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,640
Well, I'm not crazy about
living this dangerously.

834
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,480
I'll be quitting at some point.

835
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,760
Maybe I'll get into property. We'll see.

836
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,280
Leave it out! Always the same old song!

837
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,880
You used to sing so sweetly once.

838
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,320
What was it, that song about moonshine?

839
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,360
The sea and the moonlight.

840
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,040
"The sea and the moonlight
were asking after you.

841
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,280
Where are you?"

842
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,800
There's no moonshine in there.

843
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,720
What do you mean?

844
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,240
There's sea. There's moonlight.

845
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,200
So there has to be moonshine, too.

846
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,200
Where's my daughter?

847
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,520
Üzeyir!

848
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,200
I'll call you on your mobile.

849
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,880
Stay cool, Dad.
I'll text you and we can meet.

850
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,680
Come on, Nazlı. We're going.

851
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,120
Hurry up!

852
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,640
I'd like to notify the police
of this address.

853
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,520
-Semih, can you shut up?
-I agree.

854
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,400
-You shut up, too.
-I agree.

855
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,760
Don't get cold.

856
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,480
I won't.

857
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,600
I'm high.

858
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,040
They've picked me.

859
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,160
Who?

860
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,520
For the beauty contest.

861
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:02,920
Right.

862
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,480
Great.

863
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,520
So they know quality goods
when they see them.

864
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,480
Goods

865
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,240
Nice word.

866
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,120
Sorry.

867
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,440
I'm going.

868
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,880
I'm leaving you.

869
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,320
I'm leaving you.

870
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,720
Painful words.

871
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,200
There's no moonshine...

872
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,880
in our song.

873
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,680
Goodbye.

874
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,440
-Good night, honey.
-Good night.

875
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,680
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night, dear.

876
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,360
Dad, calm down!

877
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,320
It's a busy street. What can
happen? I'm just over there.

878
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,720
-I can see you from here anyway.
-It would be too obvious over here.

879
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,960
He's coming.

880
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,600
Hello.

881
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,560
Thanks for the paper.

882
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,560
-Am I late?
-No, I was early.

883
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,240
-Then, I'm late.
-No, I was early.

884
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,720
Gosh.

885
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,400
I came early because I was bored.

886
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,000
-What will you have to drink?
-I’m drinking juice.

887
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,440
Yes, of course.

888
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,440
-It's very...
-I've been...

889
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,160
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Go ahead.

890
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,400
Sorry.

891
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,920
It's the second time
we've started talking both at once.

892
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,040
Yes, I'm sorry. I get tense sometimes.

893
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,520
To be frank, I don't like myself a lot.

894
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:35,960
Why not?

895
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,720
I don't know.
I could have been more talented.

896
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,120
I mean in general.

897
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,320
I'm a comedian actually.

898
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,840
-A comedian?
-Yes.

899
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,320
I guess business isn't that great then.

900
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,480
Which of my jokes didn't you like?

901
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,080
-No, I mean with you selling the car
-No, I just want to exchange it.

902
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,240
-Exchange it?
-Yes.

903
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,360
But two days ago
it meant everything to you.

904
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:07,880
How do you mean?

905
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,600
Anyway, let's get to the point.

906
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,600
We've talked it through at home
and come to a decision.

907
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,880
We don't want to buy the car after all.

908
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,040
-You're joking!
-I'm sorry if we've strung you along but

909
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,479
No, I'm glad.
I was terrified you'd buy it.

910
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,760
-I don't understand.
-The car means everything to me.

911
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,680
I can't sell it!

912
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,960
Can I tell you a secret?

913
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,200
The car I tried to sell you, it’s stolen.

914
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,720
Stolen?

915
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,680
I was going to tell you
even if you'd bought it.

916
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,200
Well, I thought about it.
Only, Asım would’ve killed me.

917
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,600
-Who's Asım?
-The leader of the gang.

918
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,399
You have a gang?

919
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,319
No, Umut. I don't. I'm a comedian.

920
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,800
-How did you get involved?
-I'm not.

921
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,520
Asım, the gang leader

922
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,160
He saved my life. I was Superman.

923
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,600
-Superman?
-Superman was my stage name.

924
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,640
My name's Samet actually.
Asım saved my life.

925
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:20,240
How?

926
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,439
-I was about to commit suicide.
-Suicide?

927
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:26,319
I don't believe it! That's all we needed!

928
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,040
One day, if you have nothing else to do

929
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,680
Would you come and watch me?

930
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,600
I perform on Mondays.
Well, not at the moment.

931
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,960
But if I start again.
Would you come and watch me?

932
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,399
OK. We'll speak on the phone.

933
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,720
OK.

934
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,640
Umut.

935
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,560
Samet.

936
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,640
Goodbye.

937
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,000
The car's in the car park on the right.

938
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,480
-What took so long?
-I just said we didn't want the car.

939
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,760
Bravo! I'll grab a taxi over there.

940
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,560
So...

941
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,120
-is the action over now?
-No, Mom. It's only just starting.

942
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,600
Great job, Asım.

943
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,120
Hey, the stuff’s good as new!

944
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,480
Take this.

945
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,600
-Thanks.
-Good bye.

946
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,080
OK, good bye.

947
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,440
Come on, let's go.

948
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,080
Hey, aren't you going to order
anything for the woman?

949
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,440
At least he won't miss this.

950
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,240
Excuse me. Your wallet's on the floor.

951
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,160
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

952
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,160
-Do you ever listen to me?
-Sometimes.

953
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,000
Superman,

954
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,800
-you know what I like about you most?
-No.

955
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,360
Neither do I!

956
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,520
If you'll allow me.
I'd like to tell you something.

957
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,600
This guy gives me stress, Üzeyir.

958
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,040
He always wants my permission.
It really gives me stress.

959
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,960
Asım, thank you. For everything.

960
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,360
It can't really be said
that I saved your life.

961
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,040
If I hadn't answered the door,
someone else would have for sure.

962
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,520
But if you hadn't rung my doorbell,

963
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,640
nobody else would have. You see?

964
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,200
-Can't we switch channels?
-I can't do it.

965
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,040
Look. I couldn't sell the car either.

966
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:48,040
You have to 'have it in you',
as they say. Well, I don't.

967
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,160
But that's not important.

968
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,080
What's important is that I have
hope now, thanks to you.

969
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,200
What do you take to get this high?

970
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,040
Do you use anything?

971
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,960
I could use a cold  ayran  if they have it.

972
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,520
Whenever I see anyone in trouble,
I go and help, Asım.

973
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:13,800
That's just me.

974
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,240
Brother, I should go my own way.

975
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,200
Just going to wash my hands.

976
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,560
Üzeyir, you're not mute.

977
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,480
So why do you never speak?

978
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,360
I used to talk a lot once.
It didn't do me any good, so I stopped.

979
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,480
-Don't knock yourself, Superman.
-I won't.

980
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,480
Suicide, huh? You have to fight it!

981
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,480
I will.

982
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,680
Listen up.

983
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,960
People have
this thing of idling like cars.

984
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,200
The idling should be stable.
Not too fast, not too slow.

985
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,280
You should adapt to every situation,
be whatever you have to be.

986
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,080
Like those animals that change color.

987
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,720
You know, chomeleons.

988
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,880
Not chomeleon. It's chameleon.

989
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,160
Superman, don't correct me.

990
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,760
You were saying about chomeleons.

991
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,120
You know what I like about you most?

992
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,800
I know. You don't know.

993
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,080
No, I do know.

994
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,480
You have a clean heart.

995
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,880
You have such a clean heart.

996
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,040
You'll get trodden on by everyone.

997
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,320
I don't show the dirt any more.

998
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,880
But they'll make mincemeat of you.
Take more care of yourself.

999
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,000
I never had any siblings.

1000
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,960
I didn't have a real family either.

1001
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,200
Where's your family? What do they do?

1002
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,840
They're in Çanakkale. Or rather, Evreşe.

1003
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,440
-Where?
-Evreşe. You know the song?

1004
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,320
Evreşe has narrow streets...

1005
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,200
Actually, the streets aren't narrow.

1006
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,880
-That's a real place?
-Yes.

1007
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,800
Yes, it's a real place.

1008
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,520
The streets aren't narrow,
but the song says they are.

1009
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,440
Right?

1010
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,560
Use that on stage. It's funny.

1011
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,440
You're from Evreşe
and looking for jokes in Krypton.

1012
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,040
-Is that right?
-Yes. That seems about right.

1013
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,760
Sorry. I'm clueless about your job
but I tried to, you know

1014
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,360
Look, Superman...

1015
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,480
Samet.

1016
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,240
You're my brother now.

1017
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,280
If you're ever in trouble,
you know where to find me.

1018
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,680
Yes, I do.

1019
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,440
-I can't take this.
-Go on. Take it.

1020
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,120
The girls said to
put it in an envelope but it's a bit...

1021
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,440
You're my brother.

1022
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,160
-You're my brother.
-Thanks, brother.

1023
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,000
The guy isn't a gang member.
He's only just joined.

1024
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,760
So he's a member then. He's joined.

1025
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,080
-Well, whatever.
-He might panic if he hears this.

1026
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,840
-Who?
-Your father.

1027
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,720
-He's a comedian actually.
-Who?

1028
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,720
-Superman.
-Who's Superman?

1029
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,760
-The guy.
-The guy's Superman?

1030
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,240
-Yes.
-Good. So he'll save us then.

1031
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,640
That's what I'm saying.

1032
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,920
He might be suspicious
if he sees us together.

1033
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,480
Mom, we're victims! We need help.
Superman won't turn us away.

1034
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,400
We're from Germany, are we? Where?

1035
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,040
I don't know. Make something up.

1036
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

1037
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,680
Oh, sorry. My mother. Samet.

1038
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,240
-Very pleased to meet you.
-Thanks. Likewise.

1039
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,160
I know I'm gatecrashing here
but I wouldn't have been so rude

1040
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,120
if circumstances hadn't forced me.

1041
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,640
No, please.

1042
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,000
Don't mention it.

1043
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,400
Well, yes.

1044
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,120
-Hello. Welcome.
-Thanks.

1045
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,240
- What can I get you?
-The  pilaki  here is the best in İstanbul.

1046
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:58,240
Really? But I don't want anything, thanks.

1047
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,080
-Right. And you, Umut?
-I'll have the  pilaki .

1048
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,800
Then a  pilaki  for each of us.
And rice. Will you have a drink?

1049
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,400
No, thank you. It's just I'm rather upset.

1050
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,680
Thanks, Ercan.

1051
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,480
That's all. Thanks, Ercan.

1052
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,200
Umut has spoken about you at length.

1053
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,720
We also talked on the way, didn't we?

1054
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:27,400
About your friends,
your ties with the gang...

1055
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,760
And about your friends...

1056
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,160
Yeah.

1057
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,400
-Thanks, Ercan.

1058
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,320
Thanks.

1059
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,480
When she mentioned your ties,

1060
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,560
I thought only you could save us.
Didn't I, Umut?

1061
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:49,240
-I can save you?
-Yes. I told my mom...

1062
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,120
I said you could save us
from these evil people.

1063
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,880
-Evil people?
-Yes.

1064
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,560
With your strength
of character I believe...

1065
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,400
I believe you can save us
from this problem.

1066
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,520
You don't have to.
Only if you feel like it.

1067
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,520
It's just we've never experienced
anything like it before.

1068
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,440
Never. Believe me.
After all those years in Germany...

1069
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,160
You're  gastarbeiter .

1070
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,160
No. We did live in Germany

1071
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,120
but we don't like the word  gastarbeiter .

1072
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,920
I mean, so many years in Germany.

1073
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,400
But then Umut was born in Germany.

1074
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,480
-Really? Where?
-Ger... Gerzenkirschen.

1075
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,760
Of course it's been so long,
I can't remember it well...

1076
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,800
But we're here now
thank goodness. Or is it? I don't know.

1077
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,080
I thought only you could save us
from this injustice.

1078
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:56,080
Üzeyir, I offer our friend help

1079
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,120
and he's here to get it the next day!

1080
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,800
It's unbelievable what he did!

1081
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,720
I mean Umut's father's partner.

1082
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,040
He never paid him back.

1083
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,120
I mean, he stole decent people's money!

1084
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,320
No, really?

1085
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,600
When I say stole...

1086
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,920
Sometimes you have to. Don't you?

1087
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,080
He browbeat them.

1088
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,120
They're  gastarbeiter .

1089
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,960
I mean.
They spent years working in Germany.

1090
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,040
So you even found out about
their foreign affairs!

1091
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,040
If I said I loved her,
I wouldn't be lying.

1092
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,000
Üzeyir, we really have a Superman here.

1093
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,400
Stealing a chick in a stolen car
I'd say that's really something!

1094
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,640
Don't be angry, but in my opinion
'chick' isn't the right word here.

1095
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,200
How much did he walk off with?
That partner...

1096
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,000
100,000 Euros.
I don't know how much that is in Lira.

1097
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,200
I do. A lot!

1098
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,720
You know I more or less said I loved her?

1099
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,840
-Yes.
-I should stress that point.

1100
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,960
What do we get out of the deal?

1101
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,560
She's my girlfriend.

1102
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,200
Superman, you take girls out
to dinner or the movies.

1103
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,800
You don't pick up
100,000 Euro debts for them.

1104
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,920
We'll sort something out.
I don't want a cut. It's yours.

1105
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,360
Yeah, right!

1106
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,120
-Where's the address?
-In my pocket.

1107
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,720
-The full address.
-You just filled it, right?

1108
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,720
What! Polonezköy?

1109
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,480
Tell the boys to get themselves ready.

1110
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,960
OK. I'm gone.

1111
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,040
Tugay, Silvio

1112
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,360
Have you been roughed up lately, old boy?

1113
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,280
-No.
-Really?

1114
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,560
Then I want snappy answers.

1115
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,680
We're here to find a jerk called Müslüm.

1116
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,960
Pardon?

1117
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,680
He said, a jerk called Müslüm!
Are you deaf?

1118
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,000
I said, a jerk called Müslüm!
Are you deaf?

1119
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,120
What did I say?

1120
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,760
A jerk called Müslüm!

1121
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,360
-Louder!
-A jerk called Müslüm!

1122
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,840
A jerk called Müslüm!

1123
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,000
Loud enough? You heard? Where is he?

1124
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,120
Go that way. Cross the bridge
and there's a field of jerks.

1125
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,840
You can't beat old boys, can you?

1126
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,800
Ersin, don't speak unless you have to.

1127
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,960
Ultimately, that was uncalled for.

1128
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,200
Ultimately?

1129
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,200
What does that mean?

1130
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,600
Get a look at that!

1131
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,960
A man needs a horse, a wife..
What was the other thing?

1132
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,680
Bravo, a gun!

1133
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,560
Welcome.

1134
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,520
Thanks.

1135
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,960
What do you want?

1136
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,160
What do we want? Water if you have it.

1137
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,800
If not, forget it.

1138
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,840
Then we should...

1139
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,800
We'll find a spring somewhere.

1140
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,200
It's the countryside here.

1141
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,160
I guess if we go straight
we'll be going straight back.

1142
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,680
If we go the way we came
we're bound to be going back.

1143
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,800
Why are you here?

1144
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,200
To say hello to Mr. Duralmaz...

1145
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,960
-Superman, what have you done?
-Don't use names, Asım.

1146
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,800
Müslüm you say...

1147
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:35,880
I...

1148
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,840
You talk to the gentleman
and we'll wait here.

1149
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,120
Yes, we'll wait here just in case.

1150
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,360
-What do you mean?
-Can't you see those guns?

1151
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,280
Shut Up!

1152
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,720
Drop it, Tugay.

1153
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,960
Let everyone say
their last words in peace.

1154
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,320
Don't give the guys stress.

1155
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,920
You know the song?

1156
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,400
Bye, bye happiness

1157
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,480
Bye, bye loneliness

1158
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,680
Follow me. All of you!

1159
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,080
I don't believe it!
You're still playing golf!

1160
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,240
I never want to look at another golf club!

1161
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,240
-Did you go riding?
-Yes.

1162
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,640
-Then take another ride.
-I don't want to.

1163
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,560
-Go and watch the plasma.
-I don't want to do that.

1164
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,600
Look, this is my golf hour.

1165
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,120
Is that so?

1166
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,200
See if I care!

1167
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,200
Is this them?

1168
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,000
This is them.

1169
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,600
This? Them?

1170
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,320
Did you refer to me as
“a jerk called Müslüm” on your way in?

1171
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,720
Do you talk about me as a "jerk"
in your private life?

1172
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,640
Huh?

1173
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,960
That's a bit much!

1174
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,960
I mean, if you get the gossip on us
before we're even here, that's...

1175
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,320
Are you acting the retard?

1176
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,000
No.

1177
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,160
It's not gossip. We have it on video.

1178
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,040
Video?

1179
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,760
Tiger, take them to the plasma.

1180
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,560
Sure. This way!

1181
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,840
When you say plasma...

1182
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:14,440
Turkey’s in the second difficult stage
to join The European Union now...

1183
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,040
Have you been roughed up lately, old boy?

1184
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,440
No.

1185
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,400
Then I want snappy answers.

1186
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,880
We're here to find a jerk called Müslüm.

1187
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,720
Videos are a great gadget, right?

1188
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,960
I mean...

1189
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,080
Sure. Very useful.

1190
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,960
At weddings and so on.

1191
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,760
He said, a jerk called Müslüm!
Are you deaf?

1192
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,720
I said, a jerk called Müslüm!
Are you deaf?

1193
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:56,920
What did I say?

1194
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,400
A jerk called Müslüm!

1195
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,320
Louder!

1196
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,840
A jerk called Müslüm!

1197
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,080
Loud enough? You heard? Where is he?

1198
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,400
Sir...

1199
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:22,920
Obviously it wasn't nice
that I used that word, but...

1200
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,080
it wasn't nice at all that the guys...

1201
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,840
kept repeating the word.

1202
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:34,400
I thought the old man couldn't hear.
That's why I was shouting.

1203
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,480
You were being plain rude.

1204
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,080
Shall I rewind to the beginning?

1205
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,840
No.

1206
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,920
Let's get going then.

1207
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,560
Here, you take the remote control.

1208
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,400
Take them to the stable.

1209
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:12,880
Kneel down.

1210
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,600
I play an hour of golf every day.
Does that seem a lot?

1211
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:34,040
I'm new to the game. Quiet!

1212
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,120
I'm not any good yet
but I'm working on it.

1213
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:45,240
They say golf's a game for the elite
but it's not. Anyone can play.

1214
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,440
I don't get the time to play though.

1215
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,720
You've just wasted
half an hour of my time.

1216
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,440
If the boys beat you for half an hour,
what would happen to the golf?

1217
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,800
Now open your mouths.

1218
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,160
Sorry?

1219
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,280
Open your mouths!
I'm playing golf. I need holes.

1220
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,760
Well, if anyone trusts his ass, then...

1221
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,600
Open your mouths!

1222
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,760
There you go.

1223
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,720
I like this.

1224
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:52,320
You got this beating for being thieves.

1225
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,200
And for stealing from decent people.

1226
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,120
We've done our best to make sure
it's a lesson you never forget.

1227
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,160
If the impact is lasting

1228
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,480
we'll be all the happier.

1229
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,360
Thank you so much for the check.
I don't know what to say.

1230
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,040
Then don't say anything.

1231
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,760
I just love how her mind works.

1232
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,280
This...

1233
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,640
is for Dilber. From me.

1234
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,800
What a cute doll.

1235
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,480
I should get going.

1236
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,640
Goodbye.

1237
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,560
Goodbye. You're a lovely person.

1238
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,360
They beat the guys up.

1239
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,960
Is that really what we wanted?

1240
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,840
No, but...

1241
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:00,560
MONDAYS
SUPERMAN OF EVREŞE

1242
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:19,960
Hello.

1243
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,760
Hello.

1244
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,440
-You came.
-Yeah.

1245
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,560
Why are you so surprised?
Didn't you ask me to?

1246
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,160
-Does it hurt?
-It does still hurt a bit.

1247
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:41,560
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know about the beating.

1248
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,880
That's OK. It was the nicest beating
I've ever had.

1249
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,560
I really feel bad.

1250
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:53,480
I mean, if you like,
we can go for a drink later.

1251
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,320
OK, sure.

1252
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,600
For me?

1253
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:02,280
You mean, you'll stay and watch?

1254
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,320
-This is the costume then?
-Yes.

1255
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,400
It looks good.

1256
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,040
I should go then. See you later.

1257
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:15,960
OK.

1258
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,280
And now, Superman of Evreşe,
Samet with his new show!

1259
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,280
Hello.

1260
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,720
Welcome.

1261
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,760
Great! When I see so many people laugh

1262
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,360
I really think the show will be a hit.

1263
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,520
Actually, the first show was a hit.

1264
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,040
So now there's a second one

1265
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,600
I was about to commit suicide.

1266
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,400
The crime rate in the city had soared.

1267
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,400
People needed help.

1268
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:14,440
And I, Superman of Evreşe.
The only Superman who could help.

1269
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,040
I was about to commit suicide.

1270
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,640
If Asım hadn't rung my doorbell...

1271
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,880
I'd probably be in Krypton now.

1272
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,680
Really. He gave me...

1273
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:32,200
fresh hope to face life again.

1274
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,560
Cemil, what happened with the safe?

1275
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,760
It turns out there's another safe inside.

1276
01:36:55,320 --> 01:37:00,520
Maybe it's time to quit.
It's lost its thrill.

1277
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:04,200
There are thieves everywhere now.

1278
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,680
What do you say to property?

1279
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,760
It's a good business, right?

1280
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,480
You go and make a deal
with the landlord. Then?

1281
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,520
Then? Don't make me yell!

1282
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,920
-I can't hear you properly.
-That's normal.

1283
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:22,040
You're ears are damaged!

1284
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,680
Dad! Dad!

1285
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,760
How are you doing? Careful, my back!

1286
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,000
Aren't you better yet?

1287
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,120
No, but I'm fine. A crazy accident.

1288
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,840
Falling off a ladder.

1289
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:41,840
-You fell?
-Right.

1290
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,280
So when did you get the punches?

1291
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:48,520
A week or so before the fall, wasn't it?

1292
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,520
Does my shirt look OK?

1293
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,440
I had four teeth knocked out.

1294
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,440
I need a toothman right away.

1295
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,800
But I don't know any.

1296
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,520
I'd laugh but it's not a pretty sight.
It hurts a bit, too.

1297
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,480
A gang of burglars acting like they're
from a moving company

1298
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,920
took everything from a house
in broad daylight.

1299
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:50,440
They took carpets from an old lady

1300
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,280
who said, "Can you take this
to carpet washing, please?"

1301
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,880
And then they left the scene
without a trace.

1302
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,960
Well, old lady you shouldn't go for
every opportunity to save money,

1303
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,440
you should've taken it easy.

1304
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:22,440
